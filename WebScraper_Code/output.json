influence the outcome of the United States election in 2016.WHAT IS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA?Cambridge Analytica is a British data analysis firm that offers services to businesses and groups wanting to \u201cchange audience behaviour\u201d.The firm, which is owned by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, says it can analyse consumer data \u2014 including social media and its own polling \u2014 in order to target people with marketing material.It worked for both President Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, and the campaign of Republican Senator Ted Cruz.OK, SO WHAT\u2019S THE SCANDAL?Over the weekend, The Guardian revealed that the personal data of 50 million Facebook profiles was illegally harvested by Cambridge Analytica.It all started in 2015, when a Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan created an app called \u201cthisisyourdigitallife\u201d.The app was a personality quiz, described by Dr Kogan as \u201ca research app used by psychologists\u201d.His company Global Science Research had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica.Around 270,000 Facebook users signed up, and were paid to take personality tests which would be stored by the company.But here\u2019s where things get dicey: the app also collected the information of the users\u2019 Facebook friends, who \u2014 unless they had already signed up to the app \u2014 did not consent to having their personal information stored.This was revealed by Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower and analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica.\u201cWe exploited Facebook to

after The New York Times and The Guardian's Observer reported on Saturday (March 17) that the firm harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support US President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016.After the news reports broke, US and British lawmakers demanded on Sunday (March 18) that Facebook explain how the firm was able to harvest personal information without the social network\u2019s alerting users.The newspapers, which cited former CA employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in

organized by creating bolded sections.The stuff in the middle is a bit dry, explaining how\u00a0we are going to manage this fund drive, and why alt-media in general is not successful in raising enough money, which you can circle back to if you like the other parts.\nDONATE NOW\u00a0\u00a0But first, I want to talk to you about a big war with Russia, and the fact that I can see perfectly well, as do many others, that we Americans are marching straight into one.Please don't think that I am exaggerating what I write here for fundraising purposes.\nI would direct you to The Saker's\u00a0We're Headed To War With Russia, and No One Seems to Care and former assistant Treasury Secretary\u00a0Paul Craig Roberts\u00a0among US analysts, and Evgeny Satanovsky and Sergei Mikheyev\u00a0among Russian ones\u00a0for good examples.There has been so much great writing about this from the best sites and authors over the past two weeks that we have had to create a new category on Russia Insider, entitled, 'War Is Coming'.\n- if we act now, and act decisively!From my birds-eye view of the whole alternative media world, which I\u2019ve been scanning and studying every day for three years, I can assure you, the reason alt-media is not breaking through enough is not lack of talented writers or great websites, nor a lack of fair-minded, good-hearted readers looking for answers, it is LACK OF CAPITAL, of resources.Everywhere I look I see the most brilliant, dedicated people creating fantastic content, surpassing by far, in quality, the deceitful sludge churned out by the corporate media, who barely scrape by, who are hampered on every side by, basically \u2026 poverty, but who carry on because they know they are doing the right thing.\nIt is at once inspiring, deeply admirable, \u2026 and pathetic.What they lack most of all, in addition to things like a livable wage, good equipment and office spaces, health care, etc, are the financial resources needed to push their stories into the field of vision of more readers - basically social media marketing, precisely the sort of thing being so actively discussed now around the Cambridge Analytica / Facebook scandal.If you are reading this and happen to be massively rich, or are the leader of a large northern nuclear power, and want to avert Armageddon, the smartest thing you can do right now is to start handing out not terribly large chunks of cash to about 100 top alternative political sites, blogs, and freelancers on the right and the left.We disagree on a lot of things, but we ALL see the insanity of this march to war with Russia.\nGiven some resources, our collective voices, superior intellect and talent and, most importantly, the fact that the truth is inarguably on our side, will be enough to face down the liars who own and run the mainstream media.One thing I can tell you for sure is that a whole new generation of scrappy media companies who know how to be lean and effective have emerged over the past 10 years.\nDONATE NOW\u00a0\u00a0Why $300,000, and what's the strategy?(This next part, the bulk of the article, is technical stuff about how we will run the fund drive and an analysis of why alt-media has trouble raising money.I find this sort of thing intensely interesting, but I am weird that way.\nOther alt-media entrepreneurs, note well what I write here, it is free advice which I have learned from my personal experience over the past 3 years.As I said, the main problem for most alt-media sites is lack of capital, which really stems from their inability to raise it.\nBecause the fundraising will be taking more time, and because I will be doing more media appearances as part of that, I need a couple of writers / editors to keep the flow of articles on RI at their present level.\nThe way it works in most cases is that the editorial staff appeals to the readership to pitch in a few times a year, and among a very few handful of sites that have a devoted enough following, this brings in just enough to kind of, sort of, make ends meet, but not really.This is not a formula for success, believe me.\nThis too is extraordinary, a ringing endorsement of our approach and positions.That is a near miracle considering the resources we have had to build this, and it shows how much can be done with relatively modest funds by smart, determined people armed with the truth.What I will advocate for with your funds:Stopping the insane and dangerous hating on Russia and the march to war with her being pushed by our media, and calling out the liars in government and media.Stopping the encroaching censorship being orchestrated by the Deep State \u2013 there can be no more vital issue which we Americans have to stand up for at this time.\nI have devoted the last three years of my life to speaking out about this, at great personal sacrifice to myself and my family.I returned to Connecticut because I realized that there is only so much one can achieve with harangues from across the ocean, and I urge you to join me in this fight, for a fight it most certainly is, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.Our same government and media, hijacked by un-American psychopaths, who are driving our country to war, are also destroying our country from within.\nI am a convinced and committed Christian, and talk and write about my faith, and operate a website about Christianity in Russia\u00a0called 'Russian Faith'.I return to my home country outraged at what my government is doing at home and abroad, and determined to do what I can to fight what can only be described as treason.Two things I detest most are dishonesty and betrayal, and fear is not an emotion I feel much, other than a fear of God.It is time to actI can assure you that the Russian people are as good and kind and generous a Christian people of high character as you will find anywhere, and that their leaders reflect that character.\nMr. Putin is a good man, a sincere Christian, and a brilliant leader who has been viciously slandered by those same liars in the media who are destroying our own country, and slandering our own President.Most of what most Americans know about Russia, both past and present, is a grotesque lie, peddled by our media."}, {"url": "https://russia-insider.com/en/frontpage?page%5Cu003d1025=&page=130", "keywords": ["russian", "russians"], "parent_keyword": "cambridge
