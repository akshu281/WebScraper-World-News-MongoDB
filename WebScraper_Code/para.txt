Watch their first official remarks to to one another here.'b'THEY shook hands, ate lunch, posed for photos and talked \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and as Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un did so, the world waited and watched enthralled.'b'The meeting between the two leaders was billed as the summit of the century. Whether or not it lives up to that hype will largely be determined by what follows after the historic meeting in Singapore in the coming weeks and months.'b'President Trump was in his usual form when he spoke with media for almost an hour in an extraordinary media conference. He was confident of a breakthrough in US-NK relations, but hedged his bets somewhat and placed much of the onus on his counterpart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulders.'b'Mr Trump was particularly impressed when Kim vowed to destroy a nuclear missile testing site.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it. I really believe that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 otherwise I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be doing this \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It was really the engine-testing site in addition to all of the other things that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve agreed to do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.'b'But time will tell.'b'Speaking to hundreds of journalists, Mr Trump made an extraordinarily frank admission.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI may stand before you in six months and say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hey, I was wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever admit that, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find some kind of excuse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, to the amusement of his audience.'b'The deal which Mr Trump and Chairman Kim agreed has already been criticised for lacking detail or a time-frame on when anything will be achieved by. Instead, it sought to establish new relations between the two countries.'b'But Kim has committed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully\\xe2\\x80\\x9d move towards denuclearisation. In return, the US and South Korea will abandon their military exercises'b'Kim and Mr Trump spent almost 40 minutes of their summit with only translators, which is not normal diplomatic protocol. They were then joined by members of their own delegations for an extended bilateral.'b'The remains of prisoners of war from the 1950-1953 Korean War would also be repatriated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 something Mr Trump said Kim agreed to very easily.'b'The US leader paid tribute to American student Otto Warmbier, who died of a brain damage after being arrested in North Korea. He said his death was not in vain and was a catalyst for the summit.'b'After lunch came a chance to pose for a picture many thought they would never see. On one side was the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republic of Korea (DPRK), a ruthless dictator, and the other the reality show host turned US President.'b'They shook hands and smiled. The handshake lasted 13 seconds and was without any of the vigorous antics other world leaders have endured from Mr Trump.'b'Nothing could ever be taken for granted or assumed, Mr Trump said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but he had been a deal maker \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy whole life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my thing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.'b'He added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ensure anything. All I can say is that they want to make a deal. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do. My whole life has been deals. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done great at it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. A lot of politicians don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'There were plenty of sledges of former US presidents, from Bill Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who famously gave North Korea billions to abandon their nuclear program \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to Barack Obama, who Mr Trump implied had allowed the situation to fester.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis really could have been done I think easier a long time ago, but I know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I just feel very strongly, my instinct, my ability or talent, they want to make a deal and making a deal is a great thing for the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the President.'b'Many doubted the pair would ever meet. Until last week the meeting was in doubt and it was only a few short months ago that Mr Trump derided Kim as \\xe2\\x80\\x9crocket man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for his attempts to establish nuclear missiles.'b'But the US President appeared to be satisfied the ends justified the means, acknowledging the summit might not have happened without the fiery rhetoric.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell at that time we needed perhaps fire and fury because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States and certainly Japan wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to allow it either,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJapan is right next door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'He did not repeat the threats yesterday \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in public or private. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tough thing to talk about because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be threatening. They understood that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'At his media conference, he faced several questions about what exactly the US got from the meeting. He claimed he gave up nothing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and insisted the crippling sanctions would remain.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor. Sanctions played a big role but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come off at that point. I hope it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna be soon. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come off \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as you know and as I have said, the sanctions right now remain but at a certain point I actually look forward to taking them off and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come off when we know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re down the road.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'In other words, it would be business as usual until North Korea made moves towards denuclearisation.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe talked about the guarantees and we talked about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. This is the document that we just signed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr Trump.'b'The wait may not be a long one. Kim has promised \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the document which both leaders signed at the end of their meeting.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday we have had a historic meeting, we decided to leave the past behind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kim said through an interpreter.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe world will see a major change. I would like to express my gratitude to President Trump for making this meeting happen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'Mr Trump added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of goodwill went into this, a lot of work, a lot of preparation. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very proud of what took place today.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are prepared to start a new history and we are ready to write a new chapter between our two nations.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have developed a very special bond.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'Asked how he could praise Kim as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctalented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when he had along history of violent crimes against his people, Mr Trump responded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it was nice, he ran it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 very few people at that age [could do it] you can take one out of 10,000 probably who could.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'Many commentators contrasted his new-found affection for Kim to the contempt he showed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the G7 meeting at the weekend. He branded Mr Trudeau \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after he gave a news conference about US \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbullying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I got to the plane, I think Justin didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know Air Force one has about 20 televisions, and I see the television and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. I say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Push him around? We just shook hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It was very friendly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'He continued by saying he thought his friendship with Mr Trudeau was strong \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but so was his bond with Kim.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now, I really do. I hope it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good because if it is we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to solve a very big problem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'After their meeting, Kim said to Mr Trump through an interpreter: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany people in the world will think of this as a form of fantasy \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 from a science fiction movie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'b'For once, maybe the North Korean leader was right about something.'b'andrew.koubaridis@news.com.au'b'News Pty Limited Copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2018.

Or my father back?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So many people asked me this question, and, you know, I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Look, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get along too well with that particular group of people, but know do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr Trump said.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe agreed to that so quickly.

It would be the first meeting between Mr Kim and another head of state in the North Korean capital.'b'Just as North Korea has angered the international community over its nuclear weapons program, Syria has been widely condemned for its brutality in the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civil war.'b'United Nations monitors have accused the North of co-operating with Syria on chemical weapons, a charge it denies.'b'Mr Assad praised the \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutstanding political calibre and wise leadership of His Excellency Kim Jong-un\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and said he was certain the North Korean leader would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cachieve the final victory and realise the reunification of Korea without fail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.'b'WHAT WILL THEY ACHIEVE?'b'The summit itself is largely a symbolic gesture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but a hugely important one for diplomacy.'b'Advance negotiations are already taking place to discuss whether North Korea will agree to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete verifiable irreversible disarmament (CVID)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the US wants.'b'Many think this unlikely, with Mr Kim making it clear he does not plan to give up his weapons and his aggressive rhetoric already caused the meeting to flounder, with Mr Trump showing how easily he could pull the plug.'b'What North Korea does desperately need is an improvement in its economic fortunes. This is Mr Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chance to persuade the US and other countries to engage in joint endeavours and end sanctions.'b'Mr Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that the summit would be just \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca beginning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d towards persuading the North to completely stop developing nuclear weapons.

Some experts say an end to the Korean War could come as soon as a day after the Trump-Kim summit, following a recent surge in talks between the North and South aimed at ending the decades-old conflict.'b'The US President said a formal end to the war would be on the negotiating table at his meeting with Mr Kim. Seoul-based security expert Cho Sung Ryul told  The Korea Herald that the discussion would be more about symbolism than a decision with legal effect, but was necessary to ease North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns over security in the denuclearisation process until the current armistice agreement was replaced by a peace treaty.'b'But the war of words has not ended. North Korea on Sunday again condemned South Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s upcoming military drills with the US, saying they were contrary to the agreement both countries signed at the April summit.'b'Seoul plans to take part in the combined drills of the 20-nation Rim of the Pacific Exercise and Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which North Korea sees as a trial for invading its territory.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDialogue and confrontation, and peace and war exercises can never go hand-in-hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d read an editorial in North Korean official daily newspaper Rodong.'b'Mr Kim also defied Washington when he complained of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUS hegemonism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a meeting with Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday.'b'Whatever happens in eight days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 time, the summit marks a new era for North Korea after Mr Kim threw off the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHermit Kingdom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d legacy and embarked on a global diplomacy exercise in 2018.

'b''b''b'The island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeace and tranquillity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only accessible via one bridge linking it to the mainland, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also secluded and private \\xe2\\x80\\x94 making it an ideal spot for US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\\xe2\\x80\\x99s historic June 12 summit. 'b''b''b'But until a few decades ago, the island went by a different name, Pulau Belakang Mati \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which roughly translates to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cisland of death from behind\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. 'b''b''b'And that gives some indication of this carefree island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dark past. 'b''b''b'One theory suggests the old name derived from Sentosa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former association with piracy, as the 500-hectare tropical island was reportedly a popular pirates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hideaway. 'b''b''b'Another theory taps into legends of the spirit world. 'b''b''b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[The theory] speaks of the island being the \\xe2\\x80\\x98paradise\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of \\xe2\\x80\\x98warrior spirits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 whose bodies were entombed at [nearby island] Pulau Brani,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the National Library Board of Singapore said. 'b''b''b'But the ominous name could also refer to a deadly disease that swept the island in the late 1840s and came close to wiping out the entire population. 'b''b''b'The island\\xe2\\x80\\x99s association with death and bloodshed didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t end there \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it also had a big, and horrific, role in World War II. 'b''b''b'After the surrender of Singapore to Japanese forces in 1942, Sentosa was turned into a brutal camp for Australian and British prisoners of war. 'b''b''b'It was also a killing field for Singaporean Chinese people who, during the Japanese occupation, were accused of anti-Japanese activities and executed. 'b''b''b'The accused, mostly civilians, were rounded up on a two-kilometre beach \\xe2\\x80\\x94 now a massive golf course \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and shot dead, with their bodies hurled into the sea. 'b''b''b'About 300 corpses washed ashore during the Japanese occupation, the Straits Times reported. 'b''b''b'Fort Siloso, a major attraction on Sentosa, was used during the war to guard against approaches to Singapore. Its guns, ammunition bunkers and tunnels are on display, along with Singapore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest collection of WWII memorabilia. 'b''b''b'Things changed during the 1970s when the Singaporean government developed the island as a tourist destination \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and gave it its current, more visitor-friendly name. 'b''b''b'Far from the violence of its past, the island began to be synonymous with outdoor leisure, shopping and luxury, and as well as being a tourism powerhouse, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also home to some of Singapore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s richest people, with waterfront villas priced at up to $39 million. 'b''b''b'It also has 17 hotels, two golf courses, a three-kilometre beach lined with palm trees, an award-winning and a bunch of major attractions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Universal Studios Singapore, a Madame Tussauds museum, a water theme park, a nature park and massive shopping meccas.'b''b''b'Next week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s summit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the first sitting between the leaders of the US and North Korea \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will be held at the luxury, five-star Capella hotel, a sprawling, opulent complex that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a favourite with A-list celebrities, and where the most lavish rooms cost close to $10,000 for a night.

Along the way, he offered \"that things can work out very nicely\" with North Korea.'b' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The White House said Trump would be leaving Singapore early because the nuclear negotiations have moved \"more quickly than expected.\" It was not clear whether that was a sign of progress.'b' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 North Korean and American delegations met at the Ritz Carlton., not once, but twice. Last-minute bargaining, leverage hunting and final protocol details perhaps on the agenda before their bosses shake hands and sit down.'b' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo briefed reporters, insisting Washington is prepared to take actions to provide North Korea with \"sufficient certainty\" that denuclearization \"is not something that ends badly for them.\"'b' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 South Korean President Moon Jae-in has no current plans to join Trump and Kim at the end of their summit. Moon had expressed hope that the meeting will lead to a three-way declaration also including South Korea on formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War. But Moon has to be present when and if such a document is signed.'b\" WHERE'S KIM TODAY?\"b' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 After staying out of public view at the St. Regis hotel for most of the day, Kim ventured out in the evening for a city tour that included the well-known tourist spot Gardens by the Bay. Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan posted a selfie of him and a smiling Kim wearing his trademark dark Mao suit. Flanked by bodyguards, Kim also visited the Marina Bay Sands resort. North Koreans were told by state media for the first time Monday that Kim is meeting Trump. One man exclaimed, \"I know that Singapore is a very hot country so I wish that our respected marshal stays healthy and comes back in good health.\"'b' THE FACE-TO-FACE'b' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump and Kim will start their historic summit at Sentosa Island with a one-on-one session with translators. After that no one really knows how it will play out. Anything is possible, from a grandiose declaration that the Korean War will be formally ended in the near future, with the far more complex lynchpin of denuclearization on the back burner, to a rapid collapse of talks with someone abruptly walking away.

The concessions on US side were easy to see:'b\" - The US 'normalised' and 'legitimised' Kim by presenting him as an equal to President Donald Trump on the world stage. The twined flag arrangement, the handshake choreography in the meet and greet were no different to how a US president would treat a typical visiting foreign leader at the White House. The pair held talks with aides, a working lunch and signed a declaration at the end. Yet Kim is the dictator of a tightly-controlled, and until recently isolated, rogue nation - now with nukes.\"b' - The US dialled back on its demand for a show of faith from North Korea on its nuclear programme, with no timetable now given for disarmament and just a vague goal of denuclerisation. To North Korea that term includes the US lifting its security blanket from the peninsula.'b\" - And Trump spoke afterwards about wanting to remove all US troops from South Korea. He also agreed to halt US-South Korea military drills, following the Chinese plan of a 'freeze for a freeze' after North Korea halted its nuclear and missile testing.\"b' - After just a day of meetings, Trump spoke of his \"trust\" in Kim and \"very special bond\" with the North Korean leader.'b' Political analyst Josh Rogin tweeted: \"The more Trump talks about the deal, the worse it sounds. US stops exercises, pledges to remove troops, no new sanctions, all in exchange for vague promises of denuclearisation.\"'b' Colin Kahl, former national security advisor to Joe Biden, tweeted: \"Critics of the Iran deal blasted Obama for giving up maximum leverage for a less-than-perfect agreement, even though the 156-page deal provided long-term, verifiable nuclear constraints. Trump has now given up maximum pressure on North Korea for 1 page of empty promises.\"'b' The Atlantic Council\\'s Daniel Fried wrote: \"China and Kim are winners. We are now operating within their policy framework: de facto nuclear status quo (which favours North Korea), suspension of US military exercises (ditto) , and de facto gradual weakening of sanctions, the leverage which the US administration deployed, developed, and now risks squandering.\"'b' What this means for the US, North Korea and countries in the region is uncertain for now.'b' There will be pushback from South Korea, the Pentagon and within the Republican Party over the pledges to stop military exercises and pullout troops. It is hard to see any troop withdrawal happening in this Trump term with the upcoming US election timetable of the Midterms in November and presidential campaigning next year.'b\" The unusual move to hold a summit with a despot, freshly part of the nuclear club, has instantly created precedents. Trump has even promised to invite Kim to the White House. But despite the disgust at 'normalisation,' regular talks and ties with North Korea appear to be a healthier and safer option than keeping the country at arms' length. It's a process that has to happen if the country is to evolve towards 'normality'.\"b' The question of what Trump\\'s foreign policy is doing to the old system of diplomatic alliances in North America, Europe and Asia has been in sharp focus since the G7. As a businessman he seems to see little difference between old friends and foes, calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \"dishonest and weak\" just days before Kim was apparently \"very talented\".'b' There\\'s no consistency of position, just a whiplash of shifting stances. Fried writes: \"Tactical unpredictability can be a tool. Strategic unreliability is a liability.\" Rivals Russia and China gain more from Trump than the EU countries and Japan. The past counts for nothing.'b' Fried adds: \"The administration can make up some of the losses by negotiating a serious framework for \"complete, verifiable, and irreversible\" North Korean disarmament, maintaining the sanctions in place and enforced until that deal is done and implemented, and postponing until after peace on the peninsula is secured any substantial change to the robust US-South Korea security relationship.\"'b' For now, the US has diplomatic headaches with regional allies emerging from the summit.'b' And for Trump himself? Trump said he told Kim: \"You can have the best hotels in the world. Think of it from a real estate perspective.\" A future Trump Tower Pyongyang?'b' Once again he showed with his showmanship how difficult an opponent he will be in the next presidential election, with his added advantages of incumbency and a well-performing economy. He is an effective, easy-to-digest messenger who can charm when he wants to.'b\" He is trying to sell Kim and North Korea to his domestic audience. A CNN poll last month showed 77 per cent approval for the Trump-Kim meeting. It gives him a chance to reach beyond core supporters. People want a 'normal,' unthreatening North Korea.\"b\" For people who don't chase the nuance in such events and absorb them via video, photos and soundbites, the summit may have looked like a bold move that paid off for Trump.\"b' It may have looked like a win, a foreign policy achievement for the dealmaker, something that no president had done before - as Trump made sure to emphasise.'"}{"head": " Summit day in Singapore: Excitement high, expectations lower  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": "b' SINGAPORE (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 The eyes of the world upon them, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un headed on Tuesday into their historic summit balancing the elusive promise of peace against the specter of a growing nuclear threat. Yet even before they met, Trump announced plans to leave early, raising questions about whether his aspirations for an ambitious outcome had been scaled back.'b' The first-ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader was to kick off at 9 a.m. Tuesday (9 p.m. EDT Monday in the U.S.) with a handshake, an image sure to be devoured from Washington to Pyongyang and beyond. Trump and Kim planned to meet one-on-one for most of an hour\\xe2\\x80\\x94 joined only by translators. Then aides to each were to come in for more discussions and a working lunch.'b' Up early in Singapore, Trump tweeted with cautious optimism: \"Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly ... but in the end, that doesn\\'t matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!\"'b' In the run-up to the talks, Trump had hopefully predicted the two men might strike a nuclear deal or forge a formal end to the Korean War in the course of a single meeting or over several days. But on the eve of the summit, the White House unexpectedly announced Trump would depart Singapore by Tuesday evening, meaning his time with Kim would be fairly brief. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to keep expectations for the summit in check.'b' \"We are hopeful this summit will have set the conditions for future successful talks,\" Pompeo said, describing a far more modest goal than Trump had outlined days earlier.'b\" The sudden change in schedule added to a dizzying few days of foreign policy activity for Trump, who shocked U.S. allies over the weekend when he used a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized economies in Canada to alienate America's closest friends in the West. Lashing out over trade practices, Trump lobbed insults at his G-7 host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump left the summit early, and as he flew to Singapore, he tweeted that he was yanking the U.S. out of the group's traditional closing statement.\"b' As for Singapore, the White House said Trump was leaving early because negotiations had moved \"more quickly than expected,\" but gave no details about any possible progress in preliminary talks. On the day before the meeting, weeks of preparation appeared to pick up in pace, with U.S. and North Korean officials meeting throughout Monday at a Singapore hotel.'b' The president planned to stop in Guam and Hawaii on his way back to Washington.'b' Trump spoke only briefly in public on Monday, forecasting a \"nice\" outcome. Kim spent the day mostly out of view \\xe2\\x80\\x94 until he left his hotel for a late-night tour of Singapore sights, including the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, billed as the world\\'s biggest glass greenhouse.'b' As Trump and Lee sat down for a working lunch at the Istana house, the president sounded optimistic, telling Lee, \"We\\'ve got a very interesting meeting in particular tomorrow, and I think things can work out very nicely.\" Trump had earlier tweeted about \"excitement in the air!\"'b' It was a striking about-face from less than a year ago, when Trump was threatening \"fire and fury\" against Kim, who in turn scorned the American president as a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\" As it happens, the North Korean and the American share a tendency to act unpredictably on the world stage.'b\" Beyond the impact on both leaders' political fortunes, the summit could shape the fate of countless people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the citizens of impoverished North Korea, the tens of millions living in the shadow of the North's nuclear threat, and millions more worldwide. Or, it could amount to little more than a much-photographed handshake.\"b\" Still, the sense of anticipation was great in Singapore, with people lining spotless streets holding cellphones high as Trump headed to meet Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\"b\" U.S. and North Korean officials huddled throughout Monday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel ahead of the sit-down aimed at resolving a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. Delegates were outlining specific goals for what the leaders should try to accomplish and multiple scenarios for resolving key issues, a senior U.S official said, adding that the meetings were also an ice breaker of sorts, allowing the teams to get better acquainted after decades of minimal contact between their nations.\"b\" Trump's early exit will be his second from a summit in just a few days.\"b' As he was trying to build a bridge with Kim, he was smashing longtime alliances with Western allies with his abrasive performance at the G-7. After his premature departure from Quebec, he continued to tweet angrily at Trudeau from Singapore, saying Monday, \"Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal.\"'b' Trump advisers cast his actions as a show of strength before the Kim meeting.'b' Alluding to the North\\'s concerns that giving up its nuclear weapons could surrender its primary deterrent to forced regime change, Pompeo told reporters that the U.S. was prepared to take action to provide North Korea with \"sufficient certainty\" that denuclearization \"is not something that ends badly for them.\"'b' He would not say whether that included the possibility of withdrawing U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, but said the context of the discussions was \"radically different than ever before.\"'b' \"I can only say this,\" Pompeo said. \"We are prepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique, than America\\'s been willing to provide previously.\"'b\" The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pompeo held firm to Trump's position that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and said they would even increase if diplomatic discussions did not progress positively.\"b\" Experts believe the North is close to being able to target the entire U.S. mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep skepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the U.S. and the North.\"b' While advisers say Trump has been reviewing briefing materials, the president insists his gut instincts will matter most when he gets in the room with Kim. He told reporters he thinks he will know almost immediately whether a deal can be made, saying: \"I will know, just my touch, my feel.

But amid the curiosity is an even more fundamental question: Why is he taking this risk at all?\"b\" Here's a look:\"b' ___'b' THE LOGISTICS'b\" First the nuts and bolts: How do you protect what many North Koreans consider their single most precious resource, the third member of the Kim family to rule and a direct descendant of North Korea's worshipped founder Kim Il Sung?\"b\" Hundreds of North Korean security experts have no doubt been up nights wondering how to safeguard Kim Jong Un since Trump shocked the world by accepting the North's invitation to meet.\"b' Kim arrived Sunday on a Chinese plane, not his official plane, which is called \"Chammae-1\" and named after the goshawk, North Korea\\'s national bird.'b' Kim may have shipped over the massive bulletproof and fireproof limousine that became a social media sensation when Kim was shown being driven across the border between the Koreas during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in April, with a dozen staunch bodyguards encircling the auto. He could be seen speeding through Singapore on Sunday in a black limousine adorned with large North Korean flags.'b\" Singapore's The Straits Times reported earlier this month that the Singapore government declared that four black BMW sedans with armored bodies that can withstand gunshots, explosives and grenades were exempt from certain traffic rules through June 30. The newspaper said the vehicles weren't from a local authorized dealer, which suggests the cars were brought in specifically for the summit and may be used by Kim.\"b\" Kim's bodyguards traveled with him, providing trusted protection to back up local Singapore security who were controlling the perimeter and crowds,\"b' One benefit of Singapore from the North Korean point of view is that there will probably not be any anti-North Korea protests during Kim\\'s stay. \"Singapore is like a police state. How can such rallies take place there? Anyone involved in rallies would be arrested,\" said Choi Kang, vice president of Seoul\\'s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.'b\" Kim arrived Sunday at the St. Regis hotel, where his close aide has been based as he leads a North Korean advance team arranging security and logistics details.

In my meetings with North Korea\\'s foreign ministry, its officials have repeatedly emphasized that only a leader-to-leader dialogue could break the nuclear impasse. At the root of this desire lies their central concern: regime survival,\" he wrote.'b' The summit has been portrayed as a \"get to know you\" meeting.'b' \"That\\'s a perfect deal for North Korea. They pocket all of it and lose essentially nothing,\" said Christopher Hill, President George W. Bush\\'s lead nuclear negotiator with the North. \"The North Koreans have already gotten what they need out of this. Their only issue is how much they have to give up. From what I can tell from (Trump\\'s recent comments at the White House), they\\'re not going to be asked to do much.\"'b' Kim may also be seeing the gamble in a light never considered by his autocratic father and grandfather because of \"his determination to modernize North Korea,\" according to Ryan Haas, an Asia expert at the John L. Thornton China Center.'b' \"Kim confronts rising expectations from within at the same time that he contends with ever-tightening sanctions from abroad,\" Haas wrote. \"So, according to this logic, in order to satisfy internal expectations, he will need to reduce external pressure, and this dynamic could push Kim down the path of denuclearization.\"'b' Haas offers a useful warning, though, as people around the world settle in to watch the show in Singapore: \"Virtually no North Korea analyst inside or outside of the U.S. government\" expects Kim to actually give up his nukes.'b' ___'b' Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report.'b' ___'b\" Foster Klug is AP's bureau chief in South Korea and has covered the Koreas since 2005.

It's a reflection of the intense global curiosity over Kim's sudden turn to diplomacy in recent months after a slew of North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year raised serious fears of war.\"b\" Part of the interest in tomorrow's summit is simply because Kim has had limited appearances on the world stage. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his father's death in late 2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 traveling twice to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarised Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea, respectively.\"b\" But it's Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons that gives his meeting with Trump such high stakes. The meeting was initially meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-you session. Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.\"b\" It's unclear what Trump and Kim might decide tomorrow.\"b' Pyongyang has said it is willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with reliable security assurances and other benefits. But many say this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and given that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to his holding onto unchecked power.'b\" Any nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea's willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country's warheads and nuclear fuel, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea's reluctance to open its doors to outsiders.\"b' Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea.'b' The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, but the war technically continues today because instead of a difficult-to-negotiate peace treaty, military officers for the US-led United Nations, North Korea and China signed an armistice that halted the fighting. The North may see a treaty \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and its presumed safety assurances from Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as its best way of preserving the Kim family dynasty. The ensuing recognition as a \"normal country\" could then allow sanctions relief, and later international aid and investment.'b' Just meeting with Trump will also give Kim a recognition North Korea has long sought, setting him up as global player and the leader of a country worthy of respect.'b' - AP'"}{"head": " Trump says Singapore summit is a 'one-time shot' for North Korea's Kim Jong Un  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph"], "content": "b\" LA MALBAIE, Quebec (AP) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump says Singapore summit is a 'one-time shot' for North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\""}{"head": "\nFrom hairstyles to handshakes: what went down at the Trump-Kim summit ", "classes": [], "content": "b'\\nIllustration: Sreejith R Kumar\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\n'b' The media was in a frenzy before, during, and after, the TrumpKim summit.

The US-North Korea summit held in Singapore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sentosa Island resulted in the signing of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomprehensive document\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pledging, among other things, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.'b'As the two leaders came together to make the historic negotiation, the entire world watched with much anticipation. The two countries have been at loggerheads with each other since the 1950s, when cold war politics resulted in the Korean peninsula being divided between the North and the South. While on one hand, South Korea got into a powerful alliance with America, the North, under Communist influence, became a strong ally of the USSR. In the ensuing years, while the Soviet Union disintegrated, North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relations with America was primarily marked by an aggressive nuclear weapons programme.'b'Through these years of conflict between the two countries, India has had a rather curious relationship with North Korea. After the Second World War, when the world split into two with supporters on either the side of America or that of the Soviet Union, India declared its stance of non-alignment. Consequently, it never interfered in the military operations of either of the countries, but it did provide humanitarian aid to North Korea during the war. Over the years though, geopolitics has ensured that neither has it offered its fullest support to the country on account of the relations necessitated with South Korea and America, nor has India completely alienated itself from the region as a consequence of the troubled relations that the latter shares with the neighbouring regions of Pakistan and China. The summit on Tuesday, however, might change much in the space of diplomatic ties between the two countries.'b'The first time that India and North Korea developed consular relations was in 1962 and in 1973, full diplomatic ties were established between the two countries. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRelations between India and North Korea have been historically positive, marred only by North Korea-Pakistan ties related to missile and nuclear technology. This is principally a reflection of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position of strategic autonomy which will not allow another country (read: the US) to determine the shape and form of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bilateral relations (at least in theory),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d foreign policy expert and Fellow at Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Abhijnan Rej told Indianexpress.com.'b'India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to go ahead with diplomatic relations with North Korea is evident from the fact that the former continued to have an embassy at Pyongyang, despite significant pressure from the USA to not do so. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne should also remember that India was for DPRK, till recently, its third largest trading partner,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Rej. As per government data, in the year 2015-16, Indian exports from North Korea amounted to $111 million, while imports amounted to $88 million.'b'Further, the Center for Space Science and Technology in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP) located in Dehradun is reported to have been one of the first institutes in the world to have provided technical training to North Korean students, even after the United Nations declared its first set of nuclear sanctions against the country in 2006. In fact, it has been an embarrassment for India that courses offered in the institute directly trained several North Korean applicants in nuclear strategy.'b'The famine that crippled the North Korean economy in the mid 1990s, continued to plague the nation for a long time, with food shortages being repeatedly reported from there. A lesser known fact, however, is the amount of aid provided by the Manmohan Singh-led government to the peninsula at a time when the country was isolated from practically every other corner. In 2010, reportedly, 900 tonnes of soya beans and 373 tonnes of wheat was sent across to North Korea from India to help revive its food economy.'b'It was only in 2017 that India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ministry of External Affairs, reacting strongly to North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intercontinental ballistic missile launch, declared a ban on all trade with the region, with the exception of shipments of food and medicine. The declaration brought to an end the long-held trade links between the two countries. The decision to ban trade links with North Korea came at a time when India was increasing its trade links with South Korea.'b'Most importantly though, North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consistently growing nuclear aggression was a cause of worry to India in the face of a possible collaboration between Pyongyang and Pakistan. Reportedly, since the 1990s nuclear technology was indirectly transferred between Pakistan and North Korea, and the increased show of nuclear strength on the part of the latter raises concerns for India.'b'Less than a month before the summit at Singapore was scheduled to be held, India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Minister of State for External Affairs, V K Singh visited Pyongyang. This was the first high-level visit from India to North Korea in over 20 years. In the coming weeks, New Delhi would be preparing for the visit of South Korean president Moon Jae-in. The meeting between America and North Korea, is being closely watched by New Delhi for the impact it might have on future relations and involvement with North Korea.'b'While the possibility of a collaboration with Pakistan is foremost on the list of concerns for India when it comes to North Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anticipated denuclearisation drive, a new relationship between Washington and Pyongyang could also benefit India in ensuring a new market in the East Asia. This is significant to the country in the wake of the Modi government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98Act East policy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that focuses on increasing economic ties between India and its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.'b'However, experts are still unsure of the precise outcome of the summit, making it difficult to foresee an impact it might have on the Indian policy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is entirely unclear, going beyond the hoopla, what this summit has achieved beyond a DPRK assurance to commit to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete denuclearisation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Korean peninsula. It is unclear whether the North Korean understanding of \\xe2\\x80\\x98denuclearisation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and that of the US\\xe2\\x80\\x99s match, so Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment lacks specificity. In principle, a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons contributes to regional stability \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and as such will be welcomed by most countries, India included. It is, however, unclear at this stage exactly how far all parties are from that goal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Rej.'b'\\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/adrija-roy.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />Adrija RoychowdhuryAdrija is\\xc2\\xa0senior sub-editor, Indian Express.

He showered praise on Kim as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98talented leader\\xe2\\x80\\x99. He did not flinch from his emphasis on building friendship with Kim. He went lyrical on the shared destiny of North and South Korea and the benefits of national reconciliation in the Peninsula.'b'Even more important, Trump announced that he is suspending the routine US military exercises in South Korea that the North has always seen as provocative.

While the President insisted that the withdrawal is not on the cards for now, he has revealed an important element of his world view.'b'During his campaign for Presidency in 2016 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 before that as well as since \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump has consistently raised questions about the costs and benefits of US military presence in Asia. He has insisted that America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allies must do more. In suggesting that the region must fend for itself, Trump has opened up space for rearranging the international relations of East Asia.'b'Trump is not the only revisionist in Asia. Kim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emphasis on economic modernisation has turned the nuclear arsenal into a negotiating instrument rather than an end in itself. Moon, without whom Trump and Kim could not have got to Singapore, has defied the conventional wisdom in betting that reconciliation with the North is possible.'b'As the trio disrupts the regional order, two nations will put on their thinking hat. Both Tokyo and Beijing are deeply wary of Korean nationalism and the potential unity between North and South. Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premier Shinzo Abe will have no choice but to evaluate Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security options if he sees that Trump is bent on scaling down American commitment to Asian alliances.'b'China, which should have been happy at American retrenchment, has reasons of its own to worry. For the strategic vacuum resulting from such retrenchment will create many new instabilities, encourage its Asian neighbours to strengthen their national military postures, including the consideration of nuclear weapons.'b'But nowhere is the shock more apparent than in Washington where Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Korean framework is generating a political backlash. His ability to mollify the domestic reaction would depend on how quickly he can move, along with Kim and Moon, in translating the Singapore framework into concrete outcomes.

Trump is set to meet with Lee tomorrow.'b'Trump has said he hopes to win a legacy-making deal with the North to give up their nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting.'b\"The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep scepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the North.\"b'This will be the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting US president.'b'The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.'b\"The North Korean autocrat's every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists who have converged on Singapore, and by gawkers around the world, up until he shakes hands with Trump on Tuesday.\"b\"It's a reflection of the intense global curiosity over Kim's sudden turn to diplomacy in recent months after a slew of North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year raised serious fears of war. Part of the interest in Tuesday's summit is simply because Kim has had such limited appearances on the world stage. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his father's death in late 2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 twice travelling to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea respectively. But it is Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons that gives his meeting with Trump such high stakes.\"b'The meeting was initially meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-you session.'b'Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.'b\"It's unclear what Trump and Kim might decide Tuesday.\"b\"Pyongyang has said it is willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with a reliable security assurance and other benefits. But many say this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to holding onto his unchecked power. Any nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea's willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country's warheads and nuclear fuel, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea's reluctance to open its doors to outsiders.\"b'Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea. The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, but the war technically continues today because instead of a difficult-to-negotiate peace treaty, military officers for the US-led United Nations, North Korea and China signed an armistice that halted the fighting.'b'The North may see a treaty \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and its presumed safety assurances from Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as its best way of preserving the Kim family dynasty. The ensuing recognition as a \"normal country\" could then allow sanctions relief, and later international aid and investment.'b'Just meeting with Trump will also give Kim a recognition North Korea has long sought, setting him up as global player and equal to the US domestically and, internationally, as the leader of a \"normal country\" worthy of respect.'b''"}{"head": "\nAhead of Trump-Kim summit, Singapore city on North Korean border has strongest sales\n", "classes": [], "content": "b''b\"Dandong: Even as the island nation of Singapore rushes to get ready for the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, one of its namesakes is basking in the publicity too - on China's border with North Korea.\"b'The Singapore City condominium in Dandong, the main gateway into North Korea in northeastern China, is celebrating its strongest sales in six years thanks to property speculators who see the June 12 meeting as another sign that the reclusive state will soon be open for business.'b'\\xc2\\xa0'b\"With a riverside view that looks directly over North Korea, the 2,400-unit project by Singaporean developer Brothers (Holdings) Ltd broke ground in 2008 but saw annual sales of less than a hundred units in the last five years as China's neighbour grew more focused on its nuclear programme.\"b\"That changed in one stroke at end of April when North Korea's Kim announced that the isolated country would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and pursue economic growth and peace, said T.C.

The North invaded the South in 1950 and the ensuing war saw US-led UN troops backing Seoul fight their way to a stalemate against Pyongyang's forces which were aided by Russia and China, before the conflict ended in stalemate and an armistice which sealed the division of the peninsula.\"b'Sporadic provocations by the North have continued while Pyongyang has made increasing advances in its nuclear arsenal, which it says it needs to defend against the risk of a US invasion.'b'Last year it carried out by far its most powerful nuclear test to date and launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, sending tensions soaring to a level unseen in years as a newly-elected Trump traded threats of war and colourful personal insults with Kim, with Trump dubbed a \"dotard\" and Kim \"Little Rocket Man\".'b\"But the South's Winter Olympics in February catalysed a flurry of diplomatic moves as Seoul's dovish leader Moon Jae-in sought to bring the two sides together.

It was only two weeks ago that it was confirmed the summit was going ahead.'b'It is not easy to find a suitable location to host such a meeting, observed Mr Lee, as both the Americans and the North Koreans must agree on a venue that meets their requirements and is politically and diplomatically acceptable to them.'b'\"Therefore, when the two sides asked us to host the meeting, we cannot say no,\" he said. \"We have to step up... We can do a good job.\"'b'The summit is a plus for Singapore, in terms of its reputation, its standing and \"how people look at us\", he added. \"It gives us publicity. The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting - we did not ask for it, but we were asked and we agreed - says something about Singapore\\'s relations with the parties, with America, with North Korea, also our standing in the international community.\"'b'Singapore is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with both sides. Mr Lee added: \"I think people will sit up and say, why is this meeting happening in Singapore, and they will draw their conclusions, and they will see how things are run. And I\\'m sure that we will be able to show what Singapore can do, so I think it\\'s a plus for Singapore.\"'b'We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

more foreign companies to set up shop in Singapore.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf everything goes as planned, it will re-emphasise the image that Singapore is one of the safest places on Earth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d

perspective, you can see why Sentosa is attractive for such meetings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added Mr Kemp. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much easier to manage a small place, and you could very easily cordon off the whole island.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides that, the idea that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very serious political conversation going to take place there also gives Sentosa the opportunity to

While there were other factors that led to the eventual Soviet downfall, Nixon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit to China\\xc2\\xa0arguably precipitated the beginning of the end of the Cold War, opened China to the rest of the world and helped in the normalisation of its relations with its adversary, Japan.'b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor East Asia, the last most important summit was probably the Nixon-Mao summit that changed the course of the Cold War,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d associate professor Bhubhindar Singh, a Northeast Asia expert from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Channel NewsAsia.'b'The world would head in a different direction from that moment.'b'Not long after that momentous occasion, still within the theatre of the Cold War, another memorable summit drew global attention.'b'The famous Geneva fireside chat between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in November 1985\\xc2\\xa0was another significant step towards ending the bitter conflict and the beginning of a temporary period of d\\xc3\\xa9tente between the world powers.'b'This meeting set the wheels in motion for subsequent summits between the two leaders, eventually paving the way for the end of the Cold War.'b'Recent history has also recorded such unlikely get-togethers.'b''b''b'The meeting between former US President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro just three years ago, was the first between an American and Cuban leader in half a century that quickly unlocked the doors to diplomatic ties.'b'Later in the same year, the world turned its attention to Asia, and specifically Singapore.'b'Shattering nearly seven-decades of tension, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou shook hands for almost a minute. Shifting in synchronised fashion from right to left for every camera flash to capture the historic moment, their smiles sustained throughout the handshake as a signal of solidarity.'b'A watershed moment in cross-strait relations, said Chinese media, although hindsight might suggest\\xc2\\xa0otherwise. It was historic based on its symbolism, but not the impact it had on the future.'b''b''b'That meeting, though, put Singapore under the global spotlight as host, bringing it valuable experience in the delicate task of accommodating leaders amid political sensitivities and security concerns that could have global ramifications.\\xc2\\xa0'b'What the island nation is about to handle over the next few days is, however, a different ball game altogether, not just because of the potential for a turning point of global magnitude.'b'Putting the historical element aside, the Trump-Kim summit draws undue attention simply because of the leaders themselves.'b'The protracted antagonism between Washington and Pyongyang is well-documented and has consistently manifested itself in the exchanges and statements under various administrations and leaders.'b'But the language has never been more colourful and undiplomatic \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9clittle rocketman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdotard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshort and fat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d come to mind - even as US allies, Japan and South Korea\\xc2\\xa0observed the tit for tat with bated breath.'b'However, the tense state of affairs was\\xc2\\xa0suddenly assuaged, partly by an inexplicable\\xc2\\xa0exchange of cordial letters over the course of a week.

This time it is the turn of the 400,000 residents of Eastern Ghouta, 10km east of the capital Damascus. Latest reports put civilian casualties at 520 and thousands wounded under the heavy assault launched by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ground forces supported by Russian air strikes.It seems conditions in Syria are getting worse, and there is no end to the conflict.The end to any violent conflict comes when either the warring sides realise the devastation they cause and make peace; outside intervention sways the warring parties to end the conflict; or there are clear winners delivering a crushing defeat to their enemies.None of the warring factions seem to care about the devastation of the seven-year civil war. Almost the entire country is rubble \u2014 more than 400,000 people have died, there are 5 million Syrian refugees and more than 6 million displaced. Unfortunately, the peace option seems highly unlikely.There had been international intervention through peace initiatives since 2013, when the then US Secretary of State, John Kerry, lamented that Syria \u201cheads closer to an abyss, if not over the abyss and into chaos\u201d. It was a chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta that prompted the United Nations to pass a resolution in 2013 demanding the destruction of chemical stockpiles and giving impetus to peace talks in Geneva. All efforts to make progress on these talks were continually stalled. The parties failed to meet even as late as 2017, painfully expediting Mr Kerry\u2019s apocalyptic prediction.The Geneva talks were paralleled by a Russian-led peace initiative in Kazakhstan and later in Sochi. These talks could not have been expected to succeed, given that Russia\u2019s unconditional and active support of the Assad regime hampered any attempt at negotiating a peace deal.Apart from the vested interests and insincerity, the biggest stumbling block has been disagreement over who to include in the peace process.The US does not want Mr Assad or Iran involved; Turkey does not want the Kurdish People\u2019s Defence Unit (YPG); and Russia does not want any of the jihadist rebel groups.The sheer number of rebel groups is another issue. In the relatively small area of Eastern Ghouta alone, there are three rebel groups, which often bicker with one another.Since the conflict began in 2011, nearly 200 separate rebel groups have sporadically emerged. Although most of these later merged into larger entities, there are still too many groups. Their inclusion in any peace process has been problematic, because it is unclear who actually represents the Syrian opposition, not to mention the groups\u2019 refusal to sit at the same table.Then there is the thorny issue of ideological and religious differences. Shiite Syrians and a segment of secular Sunni Muslims support the Assad regime, whereas the largest chunk of the rebel groups are Salafi jihadists. The exceptions are the Kurdish YPG and the largely weakened Free Syrian Army.All along, Mr Assad\u2019s regime has been claiming it is fighting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other Salafi jihadist groups to keep Syria a modern secular state. Mr Putin is pushing Mr Assad to wipe out these groups, spurred by the deep fear they could mobilise radical Muslim groups within Russia\u2019s borders.The US and Europe are in the cognitive dissonance of wanting neither Mr Assad nor jihadist groups to gain control in Syria. They don\u2019t want Mr Assad, but they like his argument of protecting a modern secular Syria. The unspoken preference is for Mr Assad over any Jihadi rebel group.So, the lack of an effective peace intervention and the impossibility of parties sitting down to negotiate, leaves only the option of fighting it out until clear victors emerge.This leaves the Assad regime with a free run to assert itself as the only feasible and legitimate government in Syria, a possibility that may indeed eventuate.This is the strategic line the Assad regime has drawn thick on the ground. It explains why Assad forces have ignored the UN\u2019s 30-day ceasefire resolution. Mr Putin\u2019s disregard for the resolution, by reducing it to a farcical five-hour window, shows that neither Mr Assad nor Mr Putin wants the rebels to regroup and gain strength. They want a quick and absolute victory, even if it is a bloodbath.Just as it is almost certain that the rebels of Eastern Ghouta will fall, it is equally certain Assad forces will next intensify the siege of Idlib, a north-eastern city held by the Salafi jihadist rebel group Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This pattern will continue until all rebel groups are wiped out.It is unlikely there will be any fighting between Assad forces and the Kurdish YPG, as that would mean an open confrontation between Russia and the US. After the US supported the YPG, it successfully ended Islamic State\u2019s presence in eastern Syria.The US has made it clear it is there to stay, establishing a 30,000-strong border security force as a deterrent against IS regrouping, but more importantly to stop Mr Assad attacking Kurdish regions once he clears the ground of rebel groups in his territory.The wildcard in Syria is Turkey\u2019s unpredictable president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He aims to establish Turkey in north-eastern Syria as a third major player along with Russia and the US, by fighting alongside elements of the Free Syrian Army to capture the Kurdish-controlled district of Afrin.Whether Russia and the US will allow Mr Erdogan to realise his objectives remains to be seen. He may find he is out of his league when things get tough on the ground, forcing him out of Syria.The Syrian conflict will end only if the Russian-supported Assad regime wipes out all Salafi jihadist rebel groups and regains control of western Syria and its most important cities. This may be before the end of 2018. In the meantime, the international community should be prepared to lament more civilian casualties.Mehmet Ozalp is an Associate Professor in Islamic Studies, Director of The Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation and Executive Member of Public and Contextual Theology, Charles Sturt UniversityThis story originally appeared in The Conversation and has been republished here with permission.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Kurdish officials said the suicide bomber drove into a busy checkpoint. Photo: Getty ImagesTHIS is a complicated war. This is a messy, cruel war where neither side has much regard for civilian casualties.This war is not black-and-white. You might think it\u2019s the brave rebels versus the evil dictatorial regime, and that\u2019s part of the story. But it\u2019s not all of it. Not by a long way.Confused about Syria? Us too. But this quick 10-point explainer will help. To help us navigate this tragic conflict, we spoke to two Australians with a unique view on the troubled nation.We spoke to Dr Rodger Shanahan, former peacekeeper in Syria and non-resident Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy.And we spoke to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who this year travelled to Syria on a humanitarian mission. You can read his blog here at prayersforsyria.com.1. SyriaA country smaller than the state of Victoria with almost the exact same population as Australia (22.5 million to our 23 million) which borders Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon. Syria has both deserts and fertile areas and is steeped in history dating back to biblical times.2. The Syrian regimeThe Syrian Civil war is a conflict between its long-serving government and those seeking to boot it out of office. The Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar al-Assad.Unlike many regime leaders in the middle east middle, The Assad family is not religiously extreme. They are Alawites \u2013 a relatively obscure branch of Islam which is not particularly hard-line. So the people have not been protesting against hard-line Islamists, as happened in other countries which participated in the Arab Spring uprisings.But people are still angry at their government. As Rodger Shanahan points out, what they\u2019re angry about is the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms.3. The Civil War beginsRodger Shanahan says the catalyst was the jailing on March 6, 2011, of some children who painted anti-regime graffiti. Some were killed in detention, and this led to public protests which spread around the country \u2013 fuelled by the failure of the government to punish the perpetrators.Another theory says the war started with demonstrations which mirrored those in neighbouring countries, and which soon led to a security crackdown. In April 2011, the Syrian Army fired on demonstrators and the protests became a full-scale armed rebellion.4. The rebellion grows\u2026By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed. As Dr Shanahan explains, the FSA never existed before that. \u201cLocal areas formed their own militias with the aim of toppling the government without any co-ordination or centralised command or control,\u201d he says.\u201cThe militias were a combination of local area tribal groups, deserters from the military [who had been conscripted despite holding anti-government beliefs] and disaffected locals.\u201dThen a combination of Jihadists, some from Syria and some from elsewhere, joined the FSA. Some even came from the faraway Caucasus region \u2013 where accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev originally hailed from.So in other words, you had genuine Syrian freedom fighters joined by people with their own Islamist agendas. But because the FSA was underarmed and undermanned, they had little choice but to form a loose coalition with these volatile new kids on the revolutionary block.5. And pretty soon, bad guys on both sides are killing civilians\u2026As Father Dave Smith says, \u201cthe way it\u2019s been depicted the last couple of years, you get the impression the rebels are Robin Hood and his band of merry men, and that all they want is freedom and justice for all. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201dFather Dave illustrates his point with a communication he had with a Syrian woman which he published on his blog. The woman\u2019s name is Ghinwa and she wrote by text:\u201cThe situation is very bad now in Latakia province. 7 Alawite villages were massacred. We know about the killing of 136 villagers all killed on sectarian bases. A friend of mind lost 21 member of his relatives.\u201cAll of my friends who were documenting the name and the events of massacres in Latakia against Alawites are now being threatened to be killed by FSA and Al Nusra terrorists \u2026 On TV we are shown something different. It is only a propaganda. They\u2019re trying to say that Alawites are not being killed or displaced. The truth is being hidden by mass media. .. This is sick\u2026 My sister now is very ill \u2026 I guess a part of her illness is caused by sadness \u2026 we are afraid.\u201dA quick recap. Alawites are the ethnicity of the ruling family. The fact they were allegedly being killed by rebel groups suggests the rebels are not all angels.6. Civilian casualties\u201cThere are accusations of atrocities on both sides,\u201d Rodger Shanahan confirms. We should believe some of them, absolutely. There\u2019s no accurate confirmation, but it\u2019s a nasty horrible civil war with people on both sides getting killed.Dr Shanahan says there is evidence that opposition car bombs have killed countless civilians in the name of taking out a government target. But there are equally distressing reports that government soldiers executed civilians. Others, shockingly, were executed for taking a moral stance and failing to follow orders to execute civilians.Like we said, it\u2019s a bloody mess. Literally. The death toll in the war is now said to be well over 100,000.7. The president\u2019s wifeAllow us to break up this tale with a story of the president\u2019s wife. Her name is Asma al-Assad and she was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. She\u2019s smart, glamorous and she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 \u2013 just months before he became president.In March 2011, the American version of Vogue magazine ran a long, glowing profile of Asma al-Assad. Talk about bad timing. The story was soon removed from Vogue\u2019s website and the journalist who wrote it tried to cover her tracks by penning a separate story elsewhere entitled \u201cFirst Lady of Hell\u201d.Even as the Civil war rages, the Assad family remains popular with many middle class Syrians, especially urbanised Sunni Muslims, says Dr Rodger Shanahan. \u201cThey still prefer him to the opposition,\u201d he says.8. Refugee hellThe United Nations estimates that more than 1.5 million refugees have now fled Syria. Father David Smith visited several camps across the border in Lebanon \u2013 a country whose population of 4.3 million is bulging with the influx of a total of nearly 2 million Palestinian and Syrian refugees.\u201cThe camps I saw were deeply impressive,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cEvery Palestinian family took in two, maybe three Syrian families. These included polygamous families which presented a whole new problem. The wives often lived in separate houses in Syria but now they were not just under the same roof but sleeping on the same floor. The domestic violence and rape problems are enormous. I was deeply impressed with camp and people running it.\u201d9. Chemical weaponsJust who unleashed the chemical weapons attack which killed hundreds of children and other civilians last week \u2013 and why? UN weapons inspectors arrived yesterday with a mandate to find that out. And when they do, it will affect what the world does next.\u201cThey have a mandate to say whether a chemical attack occurred but not to apportion blame,\u201d Dr Shanahan cautions. \u201cFirst, they have to establish whether an incident occurred [it is still disputed by some] and at what level the action was authorised. It is plausible that Assad didn\u2019t authorise it but a local commander did.\u201d10. What happens nextThe world waits. \u201cYou would think the way diplomatic manoeuvrings are going that if there is some kind of military strike it would be quite limited,\u201d Dr Shanahan says. \u201cIt would be punitive, not designed to tip the military balance.\u201dIn other words, no Iraq-style invasion or prolonged Western intervention.And Father Dave\u2019s opinion of what comes next? He doesn\u2019t know. But he\u2019s praying. He speaks of a man he met in Syria who said he\u2019s gone \u201cfrom unemployment to slavery\u201d. That\u2019s his way of saying the revolution has so far achieved a whole bunch of nothing except bloodshed and dislocation.\u201cI see the faces of all those beautiful people and I pray,\u201d he says.Continue the conversation @antsharwood@newscomauHQ@GhinwaMaia@fatherdaveNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Now the world awaits Bashar al-Assad\u2019s next move.THE brutal dictator behind one of the worst atrocities the world has seen this century got the job by accident. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine.But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career.Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade.When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded.But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants.ACCIDENTAL RULERThe al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father\u2019s death.According to the Lowy Institute\u2019s Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change.\u201cHe had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\u201d Dr Shanahan said.But that didn\u2019t happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government.\u201cYou can\u2019t open up free speech in a closed political system,\u201d he said.GLAMOROUS MODERN WIFEAsma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 \u2014 just months before he became president.From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial \u2014 the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni.As Syria\u2019s First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women\u2019s rights and education.The couple have three children.RISE OF A DICTATORAssad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists.But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent.One of Assad\u2019s first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reformsBut the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving.Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands.A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed.The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad\u2019s Ba\u2019ath Party holding effective power.The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied.Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013.Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria.The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province.SPARKING A WARThe Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam.While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school.Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad\u2019s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.REBELS OR ISLAMIC STATE?Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra.And the messy, long and complicated war isn\u2019t just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot actually.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city.But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL?The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib.The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces.IS ASSAD LIKED?Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask.Domestically he\u2019s generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments.Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him.But millions of others have suffered.Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries.But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war.Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey.\u201cIraqis have remained neutral with their support of Assad.\u201d Dr Shanahan said.\u201cJordanians just wish it would all go away and Lebanon have always had a funny stance with Syria.\u201cThe Gulf states oppose Assad.\u201dWILL HE LOSE POWER?Dr Shanahan said the Gulf States have been pressuring Assad to step down for years and that hasn\u2019t worked.However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story.\u201cThe US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don\u2019t see this situation changing anytime soon,\u201d he said.debra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Host Tony Jones said \u201cwe rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people\u201d.Syria descended into full-scale civil war in 2012, causing about half the country\u2019s pre-war population to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadists.And while the world now sees a country devastated by years of war and left in ruins, it wasn\u2019t always this way.Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt told Q&A that Syria was \u201cquite a normal country\u201d eight years ago.He\u2019s not the only one, many people remember a country that was once thriving.One refugee Tara, who fled Syria in 2011, told Amnesty International her country had one of the oldest and sophisticated literary traditions in the world along with a vibrant film industry.She also revealed how Syria has been part of the major empires of history, including Egyptian, Persian and Roman.Syria\u2019s cities were filled with souks and bustling marketplaces which served as a crucial meeting and cultural point while bakeries and sweet shops were found on most corners.Today Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, has all but been obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Once the beating heart of Syria\u2019s industrial and commercial industries, it has witnessed some of the most brutal violence of the country\u2019s six-year war.Before and after photos of the Old City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, show the full extent of the catastrophic destruction which has taken place.Aleppo was pummelled by air strikes last December, shrinking the rebel enclave just days ahead of parallel talks in France and Switzerland which aimed to save the Syrian city from \u201ccomplete\u201d destruction.The city\u2019s east \u2014 a rebel stronghold since 2012 \u2014 has been the target of a major assault by forces loyal to President Bashar\u2019s Russian-backed regime.During last December\u2019s air strikes, Ibrahim Abu al-Leith, spokesman for the White Helmets rescue force inside Aleppo described the terror many left behind faced.\u201cThe streets are full of people under the rubble. They are dying because we can\u2019t get them out,\u201d he told AFP.As news.com.au reported last December, the war in Syria has been described as the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.While the Syrian army announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26, the conflict is far from over.A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

This is what they are running from.ALMOST exactly two years ago, as the full horror of Syria\u2019s civil war revealed itself to the world, news.com.au published a basic explainer piece.That piece, entitled 10 simple points to help you understand the Syria conflict, went on to be one of the most clicked stories ever produced by this website.To this day, people continue to read it. At any given moment in the day or night, 40 or 50 people from around the world are reading it as they try to comprehend the desperately complicated Syrian situation. Those numbers have surged in recent days and weeks for obvious reasons.But our original piece is now out of date. So much has happened since 2013, including this afternoon\u2019s announcement that Australia will carry out air strikes against Islamic State (IS).That\u2019s why we\u2019ve produced this update, with fresh comment from the same two Australian experts we consulted two years ago.We\u2019ve again spoken to Dr Rodger Shanahan, a former peacekeeper in Syria who is now a Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, as well as Associate Professor at the National Security College at the Australian National University (ANU).And we spoke once more to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who has now made four humanitarian missions to Syria, the most recent in July. You can read Father Dave\u2019s blog here at prayersforsyria.com1. A reminder of Syria and its origins as a countrySyria is a middle eastern nation with a small strip of Mediterranean coastline. Its overall area is a little smaller than the United Kingdom. Syria first became an independent nation in 1945 and has been formally known as the Arab Republic of Syria since 1991.Though it has pretences of being democratic, Syria has been led by the al-Assad family for 45 years. Hafez al-Assad ruled from 1970 to 2000. His first son died in a car crash and his second, Bashar al-Assad, has been president since 2000.2. How the civil war startedIn 2011, the people of several middle eastern and North African countries rose up against their leaders in a movement which became known as the Arab Spring. Many of the overthrown leaders were hard-line Islamists. Syria\u2019s ruling family have never been that. The Assad family are Alawites \u2014 a branch of Islam which is relatively liberal.But despite living under a regime which allowed religious and other freedoms, many Syrians were still no fans of Bashar al-Assad. Angry about the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms, and emboldened by the Arab Spring uprisings, a series of anti-government protests began.For several reasons the protests soon turned ugly. A key flashpoint was the deaths (in detention) of some children who had painted anti-regime graffiti. There were also moments when the government brutally cracked down on protests, firing into the crowd.Soon, ordinary Syrians took up arms. Many of them were disenchanted former members of Assad\u2019s military. Others were ordinary citizens. As things escalated into a full scale civil war, they were joined by a ragtag bunch of jihadists and others, who crossed borders to join the action on the side of the anti-government rebels.3. And the war raged on and on: it is impossibly messyIn the two years since we first tackled this issue, the Syrian Civil War has turned into a conflict so complicated, even the experts admit it almost defies description. It\u2019s also a war no one is really winning or can win.\u201cThe war is at stalemate right now with the Syrian government in control of western and central Syria around Damascus, and with patchy control over parts of Aleppo in the north,\u201d explains Dr Shanahan. \u201cIslamic state is more eastern Syria-focused but it\u2019s also in northern Syria.\u201cThere are also a variety of groups like Jabhat al-Nusra which is Al-Qaeda aligned. The bottom line is it\u2019s bloody complex.\u201d4. To make matters more complicated, everyone now has different aimsIn truth, this war was about Syrians versus the Assad regime for about five minutes. Then came the jihadists and then came IS, which as Dr Shanahan explains, wants to expand the caliphate it has loosely established in Iraq and parts of Syria across the whole of Syria.A caliphate, by the way, is a region governed by hard-line Islamic rule.But as Dr Shanahan explains, the problem here is competing goals. Every player in this war wants something different.\u201cThe non Islamist [rebel] groups don\u2019t like Assad, IS want to expand the caliphate, groups like Jabhat al-Nusra want Islamic rule in Syria under their leadership, other Islamist groups want Islamic government although what that looks like and how it might be achieved is never articulated. But they all want Islamic rule in one way, shape, or form.\u201d5. So basically you\u2019ve got an unwinnable war.Dr Shanahan again: \u201cI think what will end up happening is something short of the collapse of the Assad regime. A reasonable outcome you\u2019d think is a \u2018regime lite\u2019 where Assad is not the ruler at an agreed time in the future, and where some opposition elements are incorporated in the government and military. How you get there is the difficulty.\u201d6. Meanwhile the bodies stack upTwo years ago, the death toll including civilians and combatants was around 100 thousand. That figure is now generally estimated to be 240 thousand. That\u2019s about 1400 Syrians killed as a direct or indirect result of this conflict each week over the last two years. To help you put those numbers in perspective, Syria\u2019s overall population is almost identical to Australia\u2019s 23 million.7. And the number of refugees is staggering. So why are they heading to Europe now?By most measures, it appears that as many as 11 million Syrians have been displaced. Of those, 4.1 million have fled the country and been registered as refugees with the UNHCR. The real number of refugees outside Syria is probably much higher.Why are they heading to Europe now?\u201cMy understanding is that the refugees are moving from Turkey [which shares a southern border with Syria] and my understanding is they are moving from there [towards Europe] because people smugglers have found a route less dangerous and cheaper,\u201d Dr Shanahan says.\u201cPeople can\u2019t move in that kind of mass movement without people smugglers who have made the journey more accessible and cheaper. There has been no massive escalation in the war itself. People are just saying \u2018we can make it to Europe now so let\u2019s do it\u2019. It\u2019s a case of risk versus return. It\u2019s also summer now in the northern hemisphere, which is a much better time to make a dangerous trip like this than winter.Unfortunately, as we all saw with the tragic case of drowned toddler Aylan Kurdi, the risk side of that equation remains devastatingly real.8. Meanwhile, what\u2019s life like for those who remain in Syria?With four humanitarian missions under his belt, Father David Smith has some amazing insights into the lives of those who both literally and figuratively soldier on in Syria.He recalls one man he met who joined the rebels because they paid 50 dollars a month and all the cigarettes he could smoke. But he soon figured out that his commander was not even a Syrian (and was probably IS aligned). \u201cI had gone from poverty and unemployment to slavery and beheadings,\u201d the man told Father Dave.Another man told Father Dave, with his young pretty wife beside him and baby bouncing on his knee, how he\u2019d done his bit for the army by killing up to 1500 people. He wasn\u2019t boasting. He was merely acknowledging how the moral goalposts have shifted in the mess that is present day Syria.Yet the country itself is far from entirely dysfunctional. \u201cSyria is going a lot better than Iraq thanks be to God,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cThere is a fully functioning bureaucracy. Unlike Lebanon, where garbage has not been collected for months, the garbage is collected in Syria.\u201dAs the country somehow stays functional in most areas, its people maintain their spirits.\u201cEverywhere we went on our most recent trip in July, we saw thousands of kids, and all had fire in the eyes. They were full of life and spirit.\u201cThe streetlife was extraordinary, despite no lighting at night. People were dancing and drinking and saying \u2018I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to be alive, we might as well enjoy life\u2019.\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t see was a sense of resignation,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cThere is a very strong sense of patriotic solidarity in Syria. People are gathering around the flag and around Assad, even if it\u2019s not to do with him as a person or any decisions he has made.\u201dIt would be ironic if this war, which started as an anti-Assad crusade, ends up making people feel that Assad is the safe option. But there is evidence that the chaos caused by all the various factions in this war may produce exactly that result among the Syrians left behind.It\u2019s doubly ironic given Dr Shanahan\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe one thing unites all the opposition groups, whether Islamists or Free Syrian Army, is that Assad must leave\u201d.Yet Dr Shanahan concedes that Assad may well represent \u201cif nothing else, stability in a time of chaos\u201d.9. What about Russia, the Saudis and other external players like the US and Australia?In short, there is strong evidence the Saudis are funding IS and others involved in Syria. Remember that Syria\u2019s Assad regime are Shia Muslims while the Saudi regime and most Saudis are Sunni Muslims. So the Saudi desire to replace a Shia regime with Sunni Islam is just one of the complications which deeply underpins this conflict.Iran is also in the mix. What you need to know about Iran is that it is more than 90 per cent Shia. So it has a natural ally with Syria\u2019s rulers and natural enemies elsewhere in the Middle East and Gulf region. So Iran has strong reasons to be supporting the ruling regime.Russia is an interesting player. It has a base in the Syrian port of Tartus, from where it is just over 1000 nautical miles to Russia\u2019s Black Sea naval bases. Russia supports the Assad regime, which the west does not. Remember, Assad is said to have committed atrocities against his own citizens, including the use of chemical weapons (a claim which is disputed). So the west is not exactly Assad\u2019s best friend.But nor is the west a friend of the rebels, given the rebels are such a loose, disparate collective which includes IS. In fact we want to bomb IS.10. So should we bomb IS? Will this in some way help stop the war?\u201cThe Americans\u2019 grand scheme is to degrade IS to relieve pressure on Syrian army units and make room for other people that they\u2019ve trained,\u201d Dr Shanahan explains.With Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing a series of air strikes on IS in Syria, experts like Dr Shanahan remain unconvinced of what they\u2019ll achieve.\u201cWhy should Australia bomb Syria? Australia has only got six aircraft. What operational effect will that have? There has just been no strategic intent. The government is wanting to show solidarity with the Americans, but it\u2019s not going to have any kind of operational effect.\u201dAbout the only thing we do know for sure is that Syria remains a mess. We\u2019d like to offer you a more hopeful conclusion. But the main reason the world has been standing back and not doing much in Syria is because it\u2019s unclear how to make a difference.That\u2019s one reason why the world\u2019s attention has swung to the refugee crisis. In this area at least, it\u2019s a little clearer how to contribute in a positive way.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why Syria has remained such a combustible mix. Photo: GettySYRIA was the last outpost of Communist Russia\u2019s imperial dreams.President Vladimir Putin did not want to let it go.Now, according to an assessment published in the professional journal of the US Army, the  Military Review, he\u2019s won.By direct implication, this implies a serious strategic setback for the United States.The Syrian Civil War has seen hundreds of thousands killed in more than 12 years of fighting.It was sparked by an uprising during what was then known as the \u201cArab Spring\u201d \u2014 a democratic surge among the newly social-media linked citizens of the Middle East.But the Arab Winter has since well and truly set in.US trained and supplied Syrian rebels have failed to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, they spent much of their force rolling back Islamic State.Assad himself has found renewed security in Moscow\u2019s embrace.\u201cThe Syrian conflict will likely enter a new phase in 2018, as both Islamic State and the Syrian opposition cease to be relevant forces, and the two coalitions seek to negotiate a postconflict settlement,\u201d the assessment reads.\u201cWhile it is far from assured that any settlement acceptable to the principle domestic and international players can be struck, for now the main outcome of this war is that President Bashar al-Assad will stay, but the Syria that existed before the war is gone.\u201dWAKING THE BEARPost Cold-War Russia has been concerned by the United States\u2019 ongoing interventions worldwide.It didn\u2019t like the idea of military intervention in Libya to oust Ghadaffis\u2019 regime. And the prospect of assertive \u201cregime change\u201d in its former client state of Syria was even more unpalatable.This appeared to be the case in 2011, when then President of the United States Barack Obama declared President Assad a dictator and demanded he step aside.Russia immediately set about blocking any intervention in Syria through the United Nations, and began quietly restocking Assad\u2019s arsenal.But soon Assad found himself in trouble.His forces had retreated to a few coastal and border cities. Rebels held much of Syria\u2019s heartland. And the black flag of Islamic State was rolling in from the Iraq desert.So, in 2015, Moscow directly intervened.It sent in its combat jets.\u201cRussia has only been directly involved in this conflict since September 2015, but its intervention has radically changed the war\u2019s outcome,\u201d the US Army publication states. \u201cThe natural question is whether Russia has, in fact, won a victory.\u201dPUTIN\u2019S GAMBITMoscow, the assessment argues, didn\u2019t want to look weak.It was struggling to adapt to international pressure and sanctions imposed after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the shadow-invasion of eastern Ukraine.\u201cRather than giving in to Western pressure and offering concessions on Ukraine, Moscow looked to Syria to broaden the confrontation on terms more favourable to itself,\u201d the article says. \u201cEventually, Russia hoped its Syrian intervention could force Washington and its European allies to abandon Ukraine-related sanctions and diplomatic isolation in the interests of achieving a negotiated settlement with Russia over Syria.\u201dSince 2015, Russian forces have shored up Assad\u2019s front lines.There have been few retreats. Now, his troops are advancing once again.And Russian bombers are frequently seen in the skies of the last rebel strongholds, such as the city of Ghouta.RELATED: Russia\u2019s Su-57 stealth fighter faces-off against US F-22\u201cA successful intervention could offer victory on three fronts: preventing US-backed regime change in Syria, breaking out of political isolation and forcing Washington to deal with Russia as an equal, and demonstrating at home that Russia is a great power on the main stage of international politics,\u201d the US army assessment states. \u201cMoscow hoped Syria would offer a new and more favourable front, where the United States could be outmanoeuvred in the broader confrontation.\u201dNow, in 2018, Assad\u2019s position is once again secure.Islamic State is all but defeated.US-supported rebel forces are being rolled back.The Kurd separatist ethnic group in the north is buckling under a Turkish invasion.And US/Coalition combat jets and ground-forces can do little but look on.In this broad context, it does look as though Moscow can claim some sort of victory.MOSCOW\u2019S METHODS\u201cRussia has become a potential powerbroker, and perhaps a balancer against US influence, even if it did not embark on the Syrian campaign with those goals in mind,\u201d the Army press article states.Achieving such a goal was not easy.Moscow had to destroy the Syrian Rebels\u2019 capacity to fight. It had to fend off concerns from Turkey, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\u201cThe risks of escalation to direct conflict between the intervening powers were considerable, as underscored by Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons in March 2017, resulting in a prompt retaliatory US cruise missile strike, or the Turkish shoot down of a Russian Su-24M2 in November 2016,\u201d the article highlights.RELATED: US troops clash with Russian mercenaries in SyriaMoscow-controlled media was prolific in showing images of its Su-30 strike fighters and Su-24 bombers on the runway of the Hmeimim Air Base. Much ado was made about a foray by Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier, Kuznetzov, with its battlefleet into the Eastern Mediterranean.And cruise-missile strikes from Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers, along with those fired from submarines and warships, repeatedly made the headlines.Meanwhile, 2000 of its mercenaries and 3000 soldiers were on the ground in Syria, ensuring pressure was being applied where it was needed most.All the while, the battle against US-backed \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels was being painted by Moscow as just another act in the war against \u201cterrorism\u201d.TRUMP\u2019S CAPITULATION\u201cOver time, Moscow achieved success on both the military and political fronts, coercing adversaries and negotiating changes to their positions one by one, though the pathway to this outcome was hardly a smooth or straightforward one,\u201d the authors note. \u201cRussia\u2019s success is not unqualified, but at the time of this writing, it appears that if the campaign in Syria is not a victory for Russia, it is certainly a defeat for those who opposed the Russian-led coalition.\u201dBut all is not clear-cut for Moscow.The US army highlights it is not truly in control of its Syria-Iran coalition.Which makes it vulnerable to fallout from their independent actions.\u201c(The) latest declaration of victory, ahead of the March 2018 presidential election, is fraught with risk since Russian forces are not just staying but further expanding the infrastructure at Tartus and Hmeimim,\u201d the assessment reads.International sanctions are still in place. And Russia is becoming increasingly associated with Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attacks.But it also notes Moscow has won international acceptance of its role as a key player in Syria\u2019s future.And with US President Donald Trump now telegraphing a rapid and complete withdrawal of US assets in Syria \u201cvery soon\u201d, this would leave President Vladimir Putin as the last man standing on top of the pile of rubble that remains behind.\u201cIn sum, Russia appears to have won at least a partial victory in Syria, and done so with impressive efficiency, flexibility, and co-ordination between military and political action,\u201d the assessment concludes. \u201cOn the one hand, Russia\u2019s embrace of the Assad regime and its Iranian allies, its relative indifference to civilian casualties, and its blanket hostility to antiregime opposition groups are fundamentally at odds with widely held US views on Syria. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s \u201clean\u201d strategy, adaptable tactics, and co-ordination of military and diplomatic initiatives offer important lessons for the conduct of any military intervention in as complex and volatile an environment as the Middle East.\u201dNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Now we have six million people who have fled and so many children who are traumatised perhaps for life about what has happened there.\u201dMore than 300,000 Syrians have been killed in the ongoing armed conflict which started with anti-government protests before escalating into a full-scale civil war on July 19, 2012.The War in Syria has caused millions of Syrians \u2014 about half the country\u2019s pre-war population \u2014 to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadist militants including those from Islamic State.The widespread destruction of infrastructure has seen Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, all but obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war. Ms Thorning Schmidt said the organisation was calling on all countries to engage in a Security Council agreement.\u201c(It includes) rules of war that the warring partner will live by where you don\u2019t bomb schools, you don\u2019t bomb hospitals, you get access for humanitarian workers to get in and pick children and people up to get them to safe spaces and hospitals,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot we could be doing and it\u2019s been very, very difficult to work in Aleppo and other places.\u201d\u201cIt is important that we just sit back and urge everyone who is a warring party in that conflict, and there\u2019s a few, to just live by some very simple rules where you should not be bombing a hospital. \u201cYou should not be bombing humanitarian aid workers that are trying to get access into the cities, you should not be bombing schools.\u201d \u2018THE DEGREE OF DAMAGE TO HUMAN LIFE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE\u2019 The Australian editor-at-large Paul Kelly said there was a \u201csense of hopelessness\u201d about the war in Syria.\u201cThe outlook, as far as I can see, is pretty bleak at the moment,\u201d Mr Kelly said.\u201cThere have been efforts at negotiations. They haven\u2019t been successful. \u201cThe degree of destruction and damage to human life is incomprehensible.\u201d Mr Kelly said the war \u201cdefied our sense of humanity (and) political imagination\u201d.\u201cThe idea 10 years ago this would have happened to Syria would have been beyond any sort of human understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the parties, the parties are locked in this conflict and they seem to be willing at this stage to continue the conflict for their own particular objectives.\u201d SHOULD AUSTRALIA INCREASE FOREIGN AID TO SYRIA?The panel also discussed whether or not countries including Australia were taking serious steps to end the conflict and increase foreign aid. The talk soon moved to who funded terrorists in Syria and whether or not Australia should cut supplies to the country.Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the major players were not just the Assad regime and Islamic State.\u201cThe Russians are heavily involved and with a veto at the UN Security Council, that has put a block on united action through the UN,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\u201cIran is a Shiite country. \u201cAnd Assad is part of a minority group \u2014 only 13 per cent of Syria \u2014 but a Shiite sect. So Iran is heavily involved providing support through Hezbollah to the Syrian regime.\u201dThe panel heard Saudis and other Gulf Arab states have also been involved in \u201cfunding the other side\u201d.\u201cIt plays to a much bigger schism in the Islamic world between the Sunni and the Shiite sects,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\u201cAnd the US, famously Obama said, there is a red line here. \u201cIf they use chemical weapons, we\u2019ll take action. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of evidence to suggest that red line was crossed but no subsequent action was taken.\u201d The final word went to Ms Thorning Schmidt who said it was important not to let other countries with people suffering be forgotten.\u201cLet\u2019s not forget we have about 14 million right now who are in a serious situation, many in risk of famine in the horn of Africa,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s a toxic mix between war and drought, climate change, poverty, everything\u2019s happened there. And they are at real risk of famine. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m here is one day I got very, very angry by how this world treats its children.\u201dChildhood on HoldA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

The Syrian government has claimed victory in Aleppo but its problems are far from over.As reports mounted of regime ceasefire violations in besieged Aleppo on December 14, Jaish al-Fateh rebels inside the city mounted multiple attacks against pro-Assad forces in the southern Jisr al-Hajj area with both Grad rockets and a car bombing. The car bombing was carried out by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighter Abu Islam, according to video released by the group, previously affiliated with al-Qaeda under the Jabhat al-Nusra flag. Activist reports suggest that a number of pro-Assad forces, mostly Lebanese and Iraqi militiamen, were killed in the car bombing attack. Such incidents occurred during the daytime hours of December 14. Activists inside the city have said that clashes came to a halt during the late evening hours of December 14, just hours ahead of planned evacuations for wounded civilians out of the city. Credit: YouTube/Jaish al-Fateh via StoryfulIT HAS been a long and bloody conflict leaving hundreds of thousands dead. But despite the Syrian government claiming a victory in Aleppo, its problems are far from over.Thousands of civilians remain trapped and face a desperate fight for survival just days after President Bashar al-Assad announced the Syrian army regained control of the city from rebel forces.The once thriving commercial centre has been reduced to a war zone, and many of its once famous buildings and monuments left in ruins after five long and brutal years of civil war.So how did it get this way?WHAT\u2019S GOING ON?The Syrian army on Monday announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26.Along with Aleppo, the Syrian government also controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria, Deir Az Zor, most of the territory along the border with Lebanon as well as most of the northwestern coast. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State and Kurdish forces.IS THERE STILL FIGHTING?Yes, despite Assad claiming a victory in Aleppo, the city remains in the grip of conflict and confusion.Just today, a ceasefire to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held neighbourhoods of Aleppo unravelled, once again raising the spectre of a bloody end to the battle for Syria\u2019s largest city.Residents reported shelling and brutal bombing runs had resumed while Assad opponents accused the government and its allies of scuttling the deal by adding new conditions, including the lifting of a rebel siege on two pro-government Shiite villages in nearby Idlib province. However, hours after it crumbled, the rebels insist the deal was back on.HOW DID THE CIVIL WAR START?In 2011, Syria was caught up in the Arab Spring uprising which saw Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak toppled from power.That March, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad\u2019s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.WHAT WERE THEY ANGRY ABOUT?The Assad family has held power in the country since 1971.The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?Rebels seized eastern Aleppo in July 2012, dividing the city, resulting in intense fighting and bombs being dropped on the densely populated rebel-held east, causing an estimated one million civilians to flee. Another half million were displaced.Things got messier in August after insurgents gained control of the Aleppo-Damascus highway, tightening the siege on the government part of the city.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot, not only does the Syrian government have rebels to contend with but also Islamic State forces as well.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in the eastern part of the city.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.Around 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHO\u2019S INVOLVED?Aside from Syrian forces, Russia, Iran and even Lebanon have bolstered Assad in the civil war.In October 2015, Russia began air strikes while Syrian troops launched an offensive around Aleppo. Iraqi, Lebanese and Iranian militias also threw their weight behind the government.Meanwhile several Arab states, along with Turkey, provided support to rebel groups in Syria, Al Jazeera reported.The US has accused President Assad of being responsible for widespread atrocities and want to see him out of power. So far though it has tried to avoid taking part in any attacks which might directly benefit the Syrian army.It supports Syria\u2019s main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, and also provides limited military assistance to moderate rebels, the BBC reported.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) receives support from the US Central Intelligence Agency, while the Kurdish Popular Defence Units (YPG and YPJ) receive support from the US Department of Defence, according to Quartz.In September 2014, the US joined the international coalition against Islamic State but has avoided intervening in battles between rebel and Assad forces.DEADLY COST TO HUMANITYPeople on both sides have been killed, and the death toll from the civil war is now estimated to stand at 312,000 according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The toll includes more than 53,000 rebels and nearly 110,000 pro-regime fighters, among them more than 60,000 Syrian soldiers. But it also includes tens of thousands of Syrian militiamen, members of Lebanon\u2019s Shiite Hezbollah movement and other foreign fighters.However according to Al Jazeera the death toll from the conflict is closer to 450,000 with 12 million Syrians displaced.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called on the Syrian government, Russia and Iran to urgently allow civilians to escape Aleppo.\u201cWe have collectively failed the people of Syria,\u201d he said at a UN Security Council meeting. \u201cHistory will not easily absolve us.\u201dBoth the west and the UN claim civilians have been intentionally killed, but the Syrian army has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured.It is also feared civilians are too scared to flee and thousands remain hidden, trusting neither side to keep them safe.WASN\u2019T THERE ALREADY A CEASE FIRE?Yes, in February this year Russia and the US brokered a ceasefire with rebels that excluded extremists, however it was short-lived and it collapsed just two months later.In July the government and allied forces imposed a full siege on eastern Aleppo, home to an estimated 250,000 people. Rebel fighters broke the siege for a couple of weeks but it was reimposed by August. The following month another ceasefire negotiated by Russia and the US held for a few days, but talks to bring in aid got nowhere.Soon after Russia announced it was suspending air strikes in eastern Aleppo so aid and medical evacuations could get in and out. But rebels rejected the offer and the UN announced it couldn\u2019t carry out medical evacuations due to security concerns.WHAT NOW?Last month, the Syrian army launched a renewed and intensified aerial campaign. Syrian troops and allied forces launched a major ground offensive, causing rebel defences to crumble and thousands to flee.A ceasefire, brokered by Turkey and Russia, was announced overnight to allow the evacuation of rebels and civilians and effectively surrendering the city to the government.But it never truly took hold on the ground and government shelling continues.\u2014 with AP and AFPdebra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Now shocking statistics reveal the extent of the damage done to Syria\u2019s lost generation. IT REPRESENTS the greatest humanitarian challenge of our time. Five years of intense fighting has plunged a once vibrant country into darkness. The destruction and despair wrought by the Syrian Civil War has caused a \u201csystematic\u201d obliteration of infrastructure and population. Such is the backward direction of the country, that from 2010 to 2015, the average life expectancy fell by a staggering 20 years.Just five years ago the life expectancy of a child born in Syria was 75.9 years, but that number has since fallen to an estimated 55.7 years. In contrast, the average life expectancy in Australia is 82.2 years.A complete death toll in the war is impossible to pin down, but estimates from aid organisations and the United Nations put the number at more than 270,000 people \u2014 thousands more than the number killed in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.According to aid organisation Mercy Corps, \u201chalf the country\u2019s pre-war population \u2014 more than 11 million people \u2014 have been killed or forced to flee their homes\u201d.The UN estimates close to four million Syrians have fled the country \u2014 a trend that has fuelled an incredibly difficult European refugee crisis that has dominated global headlines.A further seven million Syrians are believed to be internally displaced due to the fighting, and those left behind face almost impossible circumstances.A shocking 80 per cent of Syrians are now deemed to be living in poverty. More than three million have lost their jobs since fighting broke out in 2010, according to a 2015 UN-backed report.Unemployment has surged from 14.9 per cent in 2011 to 57.7 per cent at the end of 2014.\u201cThirty per cent of the population have descended into abject poverty where households struggle to meet the basic food needs to sustain bare life,\u201d the report said.Of the millions displaced and suffering, Syria\u2019s children are bearing the brunt of the crisis and have been dubbed the country\u2019s \u201clost generation\u201d.An estimated four million Syrian children are out of school or any formal education at the moment, adding to the disastrous long term effects of the conflict.\u201cThe scale of the crisis for children is growing all the time, which is why there are now such fears that Syria is losing a whole generation of its youth,\u201d said Peter Salama, regional director of the UN\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund.A majority of the country live half their lives under a blanket of darkness as the damage accumulated in the war has caused 83 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity to be cut.An image taken from space at night shows how the lights have slowly faded from the night sky over Syria.The images above were taken by a team of researchers from Wuhan University in China from satellites 800km above the earth.\u201cThese satellite images help us understand the suffering and fear experienced by ordinary Syrians as their country is destroyed around them,\u201d said Dr Xi Li, the lead researcher on the project, in a statement.While the emotional toll of the ongoing civil war is impossible to define, the financial cost is so far projected to have surpassed $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue.\u201cWith the economic and structural losses and the destruction of oil resources, agriculture, industry, trade, infrastructure and the displacement of millions of people, the total losses suffered by Syria easily exceeds 200 billion dollars,\u201d the head of the Syrian Economic Task Force, Osama Kadi, said last year.Homs, the third largest city in Syria, has been reduced to rubble and today shows a faint flicker of the life it once held. Drone footage circulated online last week shows the devastation suffered by the city and led prominent Middle East commentator, Maajid Nawaz, to comment: \u201cAre we fighting to control cities of rubble?\u201dTHE LATESTPeace talks stalled last week as the Syrian army secured a major battlefield victory against insurgent rebels, and Russia vowed to continue its aerial bombardment in support of the Assad regime.The continued fighting marred the fragile peace talks, which rebel groups said they would refuse to join until Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stopped attacking Syrian rebels.Peace talks are set to resume on February 25.The aid group Mercy Corps says intensified air strikes and fighting around Aleppo have cut off the main humanitarian route into the Syrian city, and that tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing north toward the border with Turkey.David Evans, Mercy Corps\u2019 regional program director for the Middle East, said in a statement on Thursday that the group\u2019s operations in northern Syria \u201chave been effectively sliced in half.\u201dTens of thousands of Syrians who fled the Russia-backed government offensive in Aleppo are now stranded at the border with Turkey.Turkey has vowed to help the crowds of people, including many women and children, but has not opened its borders and aid agencies have warned they are facing a \u201cdesperate\u201d situation as they wait for help.\u201cTurkey has reached the limit of its capacity to absorb the refugees,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told CNN Turk television.\u201cBut in the end, these people have nowhere else to go. Either they will die beneath the bombings ... or we will open our borders.\u201cWe are not in a position to tell them not to come. If we do, we would be abandoning them to their deaths.\u201dTurkey\u2019s Oncupinar border crossing, which faces the Bab al-Salama frontier post inside Syria, remained closed on Sunday as thousands of refugees gathered there for a third day waiting for the gate to open.One small piece of good news came last week as world leaders pledged more than $US10 billion to help fund schools, shelter and jobs for the refugees of Syria\u2019s civil war.The money was pledged following an aid conference in London last Thursday (Friday AEDT) and, according to British Prime Minister David Cameron, \u201cwill save lives, will give hope, will give people the chance of a future\u201d.\u201cNever has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.\u201cThe promises of long-term funding and loans mean that humanitarian and development partners will be able to work together to get children back into school, design employment programs and begin rebuilding infrastructure.\u201dTHE NUMBERS\u25cf More than 270,000 killed\u25cf Life expectancy reduced by 20 years\u25cf Four million Syrians are external refugees\u25cf Nearly seven million are displaced inside the country\u25cf Four out of five Syrians live in poverty\u25cf Unemployment has risen to nearly 60 per cent\u25cf Four million children are missing out on formal schooling\u25cf More than 80 per cent of country\u2019s electricity has been cut\u25cf More than $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue\u25cf Thirteen million in need of assistance\u25cf Largest current refugee crisis in the worldNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

But what happened when cameras left the town of walking \u201cskeletons\u201d?IT\u2019S the town that made global headlines after it was revealed that, after eating all the dogs and cats, residents were so hungry they had turned to boiling grass to stay alive.Madaya, in Syria, became known as a place of living \u201cskeletons\u201d, where pregnant women were too weak to give birth and children were starved to death as a deliberate tactic of war by Syrian despot Bashar al-Assad.Now, one of only two \u201cdoctors\u201d who stayed behind has spoken about the true horror that befell Madaya once the world\u2019s media lost interest.As thousands of people finally begin to evacuate it and other besieged towns in Syria, Dr Mohammad Darwish says the world knew about what was happening in Madaya two years ago, and did nothing to stop it.In an interview with the ABC\u2019s Sophie McNeil, Dr Darwish \u2014 a dental student before the outbreak of civil war \u2014 said people inside Madaya were trapped in a living nightmare.\u201cNo matter what words I use, I still can\u2019t tell you enough about what we endured in this town,\u201d Dr Darwish said.\u201cDuring the days of the starvation, almost no people were walking on the streets, people had no energy to walk or to stand up.\u201d\u2018BAGS OF MILK FOR $100\u2019Residents at the time reported being without food for so long, they had \u201cforgotten what bread tastes like\u201d, and the ability to smuggle in supplies became so rare and risky that a bag of milk was fetching $100, or a kilo of rice $150. Malnourished mothers lost the ability to breastfeed and people had taken to boiling weeds and grass for \u201csoup.\u201d\u201cYoung people, women and children have turned into skeletons from hunger. The town needs everything,\u201d said Moaz al-Qalamuni, a journalist in Madaya said in January last year as a brutal winter and no energy for heating threatened to freeze many to death.While the Syrian Government did allow some supplies into the rebel-held town, dozens of people died of starvation as they waited for aid.Dr Darwish said more than 80 people perished from lack of food and diseases that could have been cured with proper medical treatment, while others were killed by landmines that had been ringed around the town so that no one could leave.He said the West, along with the UN Security Council and the other UN bodies, hadn\u2019t done enough to help despite knowing how dire the situation had become.\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, they let us down,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecifically us the people of Madaya and the Syrian people in general.\u201cThe world watched us die and be massacred and they did nothing.\u201dIn a Q&A on Syria:direct in August last year, the 26-year-old revealed that he, another dentist and a vet were left to treat more than 40,000 of Madaya\u2019s citizens, despite being woefully underequipped.In some circumstances, the trio couldn\u2019t offer any treatment at all.\u201cIf a situation requires major surgery, there\u2019s nothing that we can do,\u201d he said.\u201cOne time, there were three children who were injured by a landmine. They were rushed to the hospital, but we just stood there staring. The children died before our very eyes that day.\u201dDr Darwish said it was heartbreaking to watch children and babies die simply because there wasn\u2019t the equipment, training or knowledge to save them.Sometimes the best they could do was talk to doctors overseas via messaging app whatsapp for advice on what to do.WOMEN TOO WEAK TO GIVE BIRTHThe rebel-held town of Madaya has been cut off from the world for almost two years.Surrounded by Syrian Government forces and their allies, those in the town have little chance of getting out, and even less hope of getting food and supplies in.Last year the UN revealed there were credible reports of people dying of starvation in Madaya.Children soon became malnourished and lived mainly off rice, with other food difficult to attain, the BBC reported.Mothers were miscarrying and some were so weak they were unable to give birth.Landmines laid around the town meant escape was almost impossible especially for those who were chronically ill, the young and elderly.Last week residents in Madaya and surrounds were offered a glimmer of hope as hundreds of terrorised Syrians were evacuated from besieged towns under a a deal brokered by regime ally Iran and Qatar, a longtime supporter of Syrian rebel groups.However, many became stuck on Thursday at a rebel-held transit point where dozens of their fellow townspeople were killed in a weekend bombing.About 3000 evacuees left their homes in the government-controlled towns of Fuaa and Kafraya at dawn on Wednesday as part of a deal under which residents and fighters are also to be evacuated from several rebel areas surrounded by government forces.Shiite-dominated Iran has repeatedly raised concerns for the mainly Shiite residents of Fuaa and Kafraya, who are besieged by Sunni rebels and Islamists who control the surrounding Idlib province.Those leaving rebel-held areas will head to Idlib province, which is held by an opposition alliance.Under the agreement, residents and rebel fighters are being evacuated from the towns of Madaya, Zabadani, and other nearby opposition-held areas close to Damascus.A second set of evacuations which will see up to 30,000 people transferred from their homes, will take place in June.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime has presented evacuation deals as the best way to end Syria\u2019s war, which has killed more than 320,000 people and forced more than half the population from their homes.The opposition says the evacuations amount to forced relocation after years of bombardment and siege.Syria\u2019s opposition and Western leaders have accused Assad\u2019s regime of a wide range of abuses during the conflict, including a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun earlier this month that killed at least 87 people.debra.killalea@news.com.auAt least 43 people were killed and many others injured on April 15 when a blast struck a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from besieged pro-regime towns in Idlib province to an opposition-held area in west Aleppo. The blast happened at a location where an exchange between pro-regime and rebel forces was due to take place. Evacuations resumed later on April 15, under an agreement known as the Four Towns Deal. The agreement allowed rebel fighters and their families to leave the besieged rebel-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani in Damascus province and pro-regime fighters and their families to leave the besieged pro-regime towns of Kefraya and al-Foua in Idlib province, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The mood in the car was sombre. Zenobia's enthusiasm for air travel was buried under her apprehension about leaving behind her mother, my diplomat wife Hanlie, who would pack up the house and tie up loose ends. She understood these were not usual times. The route to the airport was, thankfully, clear of trouble and the armed soldiers and security intelligence officers at the five checkpoints we passed were polite and relaxed. But a couple of kilometres to the north, towards the Old City, columns of smoke could be seen rising as Government forces bombarded the Tadamon and Jobar districts, trying to flush out rebels. Since Syria's version of the Arab uprising against decaying authoritarian regimes broke out in March last year, security across the country had been steadily eroding. In December, big car bombs hit two security compounds in Kafer Suseh, central Damascus, close to where I was helping with some writing and editing for Syria Today magazine. Forty-four people were killed and 166 injured. Spasmodic violence continued in the following months, making life steadily more dangerous. Then, in July, armed rebels took over some districts in the city. Fighting and shelling became a daily event and the peril ever-present. It was no longer worth the risk to remain in the city. In our three-and-a-half years in Syria, we saw the country not only from street level but also from the edges of elite circles - our daughter was at school with the son of President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma and they attended school functions like any well-to-do couple. And for two years I was able to travel extensively, from the black-stoned Roman remains in Bosra in the south, to the crumbling 5000-year-old Mesopotamian ruins at Mari on the Euphrates. I visited the Roman ruin at Palmyra, the 3700-year-old site of Ugarit and the luminescent St Simeon Cathedral ruin north of Aleppo near the Turkish border. On the other hand we knew what it was like to be shadowed by the security forces and to be surrounded by angry mobs. Many of our Syrian friends told stories of rampant bribery, cronyism, arbitrary arrest and lengthy imprisonment without trial. Yet when the Arab Spring broke out last year, Syria seemed the least likely place that would succumb. Though it was still a totalitarian state, some reform had been allowed and Bashar and Asma seemed to be popular, at least among the middle classes. All that began to change in March last year when security forces overstepped the mark by torturing a group of children caught writing anti-government graffiti. The cracks swiftly appeared in the brittle structure of the state, exposing deep divisions in the country along regional, religious, ethnic and class lines. These divisions had been hidden by a ruthless Soviet-style police state, in which all organs of government were controlled by the presidency and the security apparatus. The citizen effectively had no rights and the government no requirement for accountability. About 15 branches of the 70,000 strong security apparatus, supported by networks of informers, ensured that all political space was shut down and the media tightly controlled. Any active opposition figures were imprisoned or exiled. The secret police, the Mukhabarat, were everywhere. Young men in black leather jackets and jeans with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders frequently reminded me that I could not take photos near the multitude of security and military compounds around Damascus. Whenever I travelled out of the city, they followed in the security services' standard issue beat-up Peugeot 404s. There was no hiding the poverty in the poorer towns and the slums encircling Damascus and Aleppo. In 2010, per capita GDP was only US$5200 ($6228) and 34 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line. Unemployment was estimated at over 20 per cent, and was especially high for the young. Cronyism, corruption and nepotism were rampant throughout government. A friend of mine returned to Syria in 2009, after living outside of the country for several years. To clear her possessions from customs at the port in Lattakia, she was required to pay a bribe of US$1000. The regime controlled all government employment. Merit was not part of the process. It was \"wasta\", or patronage, that counted. Citizens were frequently arrested and detained without charge. A friend spent many years in Assad jails without charge for suspected association with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, membership of which carries the death penalty. The Assad family occupied the very top of the Syrian power pyramid, and controlled the security apparatus including the police, the military, and the Mukhabarat. Below them were layers of mostly fellow Alawite senior functionaries, supported by Christians and Sunnis who knew their only way to get ahead was to ally with the regime. The Government was essentially a huge family mafia. The Alawites, a Shia sect, make up 10 per cent of Syria's population, Christians 10 per cent, Sunnis 70 per cent, Druze two per cent, Kurds 7 per cent and others 1 per cent. On the surface the sectarian make-up of the country had little impact on daily life. Government censors would not allow reference to any sectarian group. Syria was a secular Arab nationalist state with social and religious freedom: there were no restrictions on dress and alcohol was discreetly available. But the regime ruled by fear. Its propaganda machine instilled in the population a fear of Muslim extremism, of Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, Wahabis and Al Qaeda. The aim was to ensure the support of Alawites, Christians, and Druze, and the more liberal Sunnis. In the first couple of years we were there, Syria seemed to be emerging from a long period of isolation. Relations with Turkey had improved dramatically, with free trade and visa-free agreements. The economy was also growing, if slowly at 3.4 per cent, with tourism making up for declining oil and gas revenues. Since 2005, Assad had moved, if haltingly, to reform the economy on a market-social model. Foreign investment, particularly in the banking sector, was encouraged. Despite the obvious poverty, in Damascus and Aleppo wealth was evident on the streets with luxury cars and European boutiques evidence of a growing elite. Against this background, when colleagues asked me in February 2011 - after the Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya uprisings - whether Syria might be next, I said \"very unlikely\". At that time Assad was 45 years old and his wife Asma 35. They were a popular couple. Some economic reforms had brought change, and although Assad's talk of political reform had produced no results, there was the hope that the regime would read the signs in the region and get ahead of the reform game. Importantly, unlike Tunisia and the other dictatorships in the region, the Syrian leadership was not allied to the West. Syria stood, with Iran and the Lebanese Shia militia cum political party Hizbullah, against the so-called \"Zionist-American project\" in the Middle East, a policy popular on the Arab street. Well, I was wrong. My perspective was perhaps coloured by personal experience. Zenobia spent a year in the same class as Karim al-Assad, the president's son. When I attended parent-teacher meetings, Asma, the \"first lady\", was present. Her contributions were always low-key, but it was clear she was a liberal, modern, intelligent and eloquent woman. At the end-of-year school concert Bashar and Asma came along in their jeans and leather jackets, and mingled freely with the children. This outgoing and relaxed style had endeared this couple to the country's moneyed elite and the rising middle class, if not the country at large. The regime's true colours were shown when 15 children wrote anti-government graffiti on a wall in the southern city of Dera'a in March last year. The security forces arrested them, took them to Damascus, beat and tortured them, including pulling out some fingernails. This outraged their extended families and fellow citizens who took to the streets in protest where security forces fired on the unarmed crowd, killing several people. The regime's strategy was immediately revealed - it would intimidate and bludgeon all opposition into submission using deadly force if necessary. But demonstrations spread across the country. Syria's time had come. The protests, and the regime's response, shocked everyone. After 40 years of fear, suppression, censorship and intimidation, a self-liberation took hold as citizens massed in the streets, initially shouting for democratic reforms, dignity, an end to corruption and a reigning-in of the security services. As protest spread and the crackdown intensified, the demands escalated into calls for an end to the Assad regime. The fear barrier had been broken. In April last year we saw for ourselves how the divisions in Syrian society were opening up when we travelled to Aleppo, stopping on the way to view the \"lost cities\", a cluster of AD400 Byzantine towns. At the town of Murat Al-Numan we noticed a large group of young men standing around with Syrian flag; a kilometre away was another group of 200 or 300 marching toward the town. A young Syrian pulled up and shouted in English that we must turn around, \"there was trouble\". We did so. But by then the group in town had swelled. Armed with sticks and clubs they were marching towards the other group, shouting pro-government slogans. We were caught in the middle. To our relief the angry mob let us pass through their ranks without incident. The two groups embodied the sharp divisions that were opening up in Syrian society.. The regime's propaganda response was that the violence emanated from \"armed terrorist groups\", including criminals and religious extremists, supported by foreigners. The regime staged televised \"confessions\" of young men with their weapons to validate the story, while armed thugs were recruited by the regime into the mostly Alawite \"Shabbiha\" gangs to do the more unsavoury intimidation work. The torture of protesters, mostly young, became routine. A friend of mine had one of his workers arrested. They beat and humiliated him for 10 days, then left him alone for 20 days for his wounds to heal, then released him to his family. Such stories are very common. In some cases the regime would return a mutilated corpse. Assad belatedly announced some modest political reforms as protests increased. The emergency law, invoked following the 1963 Baathist coup, was lifted. A new media law was passed. A referendum on a new constitution was held on February 26, 2012. Parliamentary elections were held on May 7, and a new government formed on June 23. However these \"reforms\" were a sham and included no input from the opposition, who boycotted the elections. The secular veneer of Syrian society began to lift as the violence intensified. The protesters and victims of state violence were overwhelmingly Sunni. They were being killed and tortured by a security apparatus which was predominantly Shia Alawite. The UN Human Rights Council appointed an independent commission on Syria which released a report last month confirming that government forces had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, torture, sexual violence, looting and destruction of property. The report also found that government forces and \"Shabbiha\" had massacred 108 civilians in Houla, a massacre the regime had blamed on \"armed terrorist groups\". The commission found opposition fighters had also committed war crimes, including murder, extrajudicial execution and torture. During the first six months of the uprising, the regime was able to mount some huge pro-government demonstrations, particularly in Damascus. These were held on weekdays so government workers and schoolchildren could be marshalled to attend. But communities of Alawis and Christians and others also willingly attended. These rallies stopped as the regime became increasingly aware its support base was shrinking. It is very difficult to assess support for the regime, but there is little doubt that it is still considerable. A Christian friend of mine remains implacably in support of Assad, but only because he fears the rule of the majority Sunnis, a rule he believes would be extremist and anti-Christian. The sharp domestic divide is mirrored at regional and international levels. Iran has been closely allied to Syria since the Assads backed them in their 1980-1988 war against Iraq. Iran is supplying both weapons and technical assistance to the Assad regime. Syria has also facilitated the supply of Iranian arms to Hizbullah, which is now the leading faction in the Lebanese government. The US-British invasion of Iraq facilitated the rise of the majority Shia to power there, and as a result Iraq too supports the Assad regime. On the other side of the regional divide Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have all called for an orderly transition and for Assad to step down. It is widely believed that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are supplying arms to anti-government rebels. The Arab League sent monitors to Syria in December last year to help negotiate a ceasefire, but they were withdrawn three months later, having been ignored by both sides. The international community is also divided. Russia and China have blocked three UN Security Council resolutions to put pressure on Assad to implement a ceasefire and engage the opposition in dialogue. Though the Security Council did agree to a joint Arab League-UN peace initiative under former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, the mission was without teeth and it failed. Annan left his post last month and the 300 strong UN Supervisory Mission in Syria, which included a small New Zealand element, was withdrawn. Lakhdar Ebrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, replaced Annan three weeks ago. He admitted that his mission is \"almost impossible\", and most analysts doubt he can conjure up the peaceful solution which eluded Annan. Too much blood has been spilled. Coinciding with Ebrahimi's appointment, Mohammad Mursi, Egypt's president, convened a regional \"Quartet\" comprising Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Quartet seems as divided as the Security Council and without a change in Iran's stance is unlikely to be in a position to pressure the Assad regime or the rebels to lay down arms and begin a dialogue. After 18 months, the Syrian uprising has claimed more than 20,000 lives according to a conservative UN estimate. More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, 2.5 million require humanitarian assistance, and more than 230,000 have fled and are registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Syrian opposition groups say 26,000 people have been detained. From the outset, Assad's regime has unswervingly followed the security solution, and government forces have resorted to artillery, tank, and more recently air bombardments including on residential areas. The regime is morphing into an Alawite militia prepared to fight it out to the bitter end, regardless of the cost to the country. Negotiation and compromise are not part of the state's lexicon. And the ranks of anti-government rebels have been growing steadily as more and more Syrians take up arms to avenge the violence against their families, villages and towns. The boldness of their attacks on government targets has increased, and regime \"insiders\" are helping them. Our lives over the past few months had become increasingly constrained by security considerations. There were several small roadside bombs targeting military vehicles exploding just a few kilometres from the house. All unnecessary travel was curtailed. However the wider dangers of this war came home to us personally in July this year when the opposition Free Syrian Army assassinated four top security officials, including Assad's brother-in-law, at a meeting in a military compound a few hundred metres from the presidential residence. In response Assad forces dramatically intensified their artillery bombardment of several districts of Damascus making life unpredictable and dangerous, and provoking an exodus of tens of thousands from Damascus across the border into Lebanon. We joined that search for safety because there were clear risks of a dramatic escalation of the conflict. We spent 10 days in Beirut waiting for a break in the fighting so we could return and pack our things. There is a high risk that the conflict will become an increasingly sectarian proxy war with, on the Assad regime's side, Shia Iran, Iraq, and Hizbullah, backed by Russia and China; and supporting the opposition, Sunni Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey backed by the US, Britain and France. This is a civil war which could last years and take countless lives. On the day we left, Zenobia and I reached the airport in time to catch one of the last Etihad flights out before the airline stopped its Damascus service. As the aircraft swung south over the parched August desert towards Abu Dhabi, my thoughts turned to the wonderful Syrians who had proudly shared their beautiful, ancient and romantic Damascus with us for three and a half years. Though many Syrian friends who had the means had already left the country, and others had escaped on study grants overseas, I was leaving most behind to face a violent and uncertain future. It seems the price Syrians will pay to achieve their freedom from a corrupt, brutal and inept dictatorship will far outweigh that paid by their awakened Arab counterparts in the region.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine, according to news.com.au. But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career. Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade. When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded. But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants. The al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father's death. According to the Lowy Institute's Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change. \"He had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\" Dr Shanahan said. But that didn't happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government. \"You can't open up free speech in a closed political system,\" he said. Asma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 - just months before he became president. From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial - the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni. As Syria's First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women's rights and education. The couple have three children. Assad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists. But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent. One of Assad's first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reforms. But the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving. Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands. A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed. The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad's Ba'ath Party holding effective power. The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied. Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013. Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria. The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province. The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.

By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back. More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front. The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces. Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask. Domestically he's generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments.

The US President has frequently disputed that his election opponent won more votes than he did and his predecessor drew a bigger inauguration crowd. He has taken time out from the biggest job on the planet to feud on Twitter with Arnold Schwarzenegger over ratings for The Apprentice. During a speech to Congress, his idea of offering comfort to a dead Navy Seal's widow after she received a standing ovation was to say her husband was \"very happy, because I think he just broke a record\". So, weeks of job approval ratings, chronically low for a new US president, must have been hard to stomach. Gallup figures showing Trump at 37 and 38 per cent approval have been widely shared among politicos on the President's social media of choice, Twitter. And polls showed sliding support among groups of voters for Trump and his policies. When combined with daily doses of bad news about the Russia investigation, stalled healthcare reform, legal blocks to immigration moves, insider leaking and Trump Administration chaos, it was clear change was required. Unpopularity makes it harder for a president to push through programmes and easier for opponents to obstruct. The story of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, illustrated in ever-widening web lines in graphics, has become the President's own email server saga millstone. What could shift it? On Friday, as US cruise missiles punched holes in hangars on the Syria regime's Shayrat base, a widely-shared Trump tweet from October 9, 2012 hinted at a possible parallel playing out: \"Now that Obama's poll numbers are in tailspin - watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.\" Trump's cruise missile strikes days after an apparent chemical weapons attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun need to be seen in the context of his domestic political woes and his background on the Syrian civil war. Eleven weeks into his presidency, Trump is attempting a reset, trying to boost his popularity and control the agenda. He wants to change the conversation from the Russia probe and the allegation he is President Vladimir Putin's puppet. The strikes are part of it, so is generally creating a perception of 'winning', being decisive, being taken more seriously, presenting messages more competently and having the right advisers. So far, in the past few days, it is working. REACTION TO THE RETALIATION Although the speed of the retaliation was a surprise, the action wasn't to pundits who have seen it all before from previous leaders. Harvard professor Stephen Walt tweeted on Thursday: \"I don't know what Trump will do re Syria. But I'm betting it will be some loud, well-publicised, and strategically meaningless airstrikes.\" With the missile strikes, Trump has had the best couple of days of his presidency. On the face of it, he has taken unusually quick, decisive action on an issue that gives him a chance to show empathy and people generally agree on. The taboo on chemcal weapons is worth upholding, right? Both the Washington establishment and mainstream US media have largely been sympathetic. A poll boost is sure to follow. Foreign leaders have expressed support. His former opponent Hillary Clinton in an interview on Friday called for strikes against Syrian airfields. The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \"the era of American passivity is over\". Democrat leader in the House Nancy Pelosi called Trump's strikes a \"proportional response\". Former Obama Administration ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, called them \"correct and well executed\". The New York Times and Guardian ran story-behind-the-story articles which bolstered Trump's assertion that he was spurred into action by footage of Syria's suffering people and depicted him as a man of action. The New York Times: \"Trump was already shaken by photos his staff had shown him of children dying ... so the President did not need a lot of convincing ... aides say the images from Syria - especially those showing the suffering of small children and babies - weigh on him ... The first public evidence of the President's concern about the chemical attack comes ... Trump says his horror at the images of 'innocent children, innocent babies' choked by poison gas in the attack has led him to reassess his approach to Syria.\" The Guardian: \"The images had a profound effect on the US President ... 'I will tell you that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me - big impact,' Trump told reporters ... Trump had criticised Obama for vacillation and weakness. Would he act differently? Within 24 hours Trump's flexibility had translated into direct action ... After weeks in which his Administration had seemed consumed by leaks, in fighting, drift and ineptitude, Trump was moving at speed.\" CNN ran a report with the extremely Trump-friendly headline: \"These are the images that moved President Trump to act in Syria\". Daily Beast and CNN commentator Matt Lewis tweeted: \"Trump can punish Assad, deter future use of chemical weapons, send a message to the world, & still avoid the mess of regime change.\" Presenter with Britain's Channel 4 Matt Frei tweeted: \"With Syria strikes @realDonaldTrump showed 1he can act decisively 2not Russia's puppet 3not Obama 4has humanitarian reflex5 unpredictable.\" As MSNBC host Chris Hayes noted: \"Tonight Trump is getting praise from the very same Establishment he ran against and whose approval he desperately seeks.\" The circumstances surrounding the President's crisis point were significant.Trump dealt with the Syria issue while hosting the Chinese President Xi Jinping. He received a major Congressional victory with the Senate confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. And various reports emerged of a staff shake-up, with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Stephen Bannon said to be in trouble. The staffing reports had Trump ordering his aides to sort it out. The message being, man in charge is putting that infighting behind him. TRUMP'S BIG U-TURN ON SYRIA According to the Daily Beast, there had been nine previous suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria this year, with toxic chlorine gas, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Trump Administration had shown no previous desire to take retalitory action. And what about deaths caused by conventional weapons? Remember the agonising fall of Aleppo late last year? Trump's team has been trying hard to get a ban on Syrian refugees - fleeing their brutal dictator - from entering the US. Before he became president, Trump said numerous times in 2013 and 2014 that the US should not bomb Syria. In 2013 former President Barack Obama declared chemical weapon use a red line and then backed down from taking military action in the face of popular and Congressional opposition. In August 2013, chemical weapons were used against people in Ghouta, killing about 1300. Trump tweeted: \"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long-term conflict?\" And: \"President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your 'powder' for another (and more important) day!\" Acting on the latest atrocity - thought to involve sarin gas - gave Trump a chance to shape up in comparison to Obama. Yesterday, press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a photo of Trump and team at a briefing in what was clearly meant to mirror the famous picture of Obama and officials during the Osama bin Laden raid. Washington Post blogger Paul Waldman tweeted: \"In these foreign policy crises, almost impossible to overestimate the role Trump's desire 2B tougher than Obama will play in his decisions\". Trump called it a \"targeted\" strike \"on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread of chemical weapons\". Syria denies using nerve gas. Trump's speech sounded very much like something George W. Bush could have delivered. \"My fellow Americans\", \"no child of God\", \"end the slaughter\", \"we pray for God's wisdom\", \"America stands for justice\". The only Trumpian note in it was \"beautiful babies\". Trump's sudden concern for Syrians is problematic whether taken at face value or not. Firstly, it is a convenient phenomenon that we can only take his word for. Secondly, it only seems to apply to Syrians killed by chemical weapons. Thirdly, it goes against his background statements and actions towards Syrian refugees. Fourthly, is it a good thing that the President can suddenly change course based on an emotional, gut reaction? Also, as Micah Zenko of the Council of Foreign Relations tweeted: \"That Trump was moved by graphic images to OK the attack won't be lost on all threatened groups seeking US intervention on their behalf.\" WHAT DID THE STRIKES ACHIEVE? For many people hoping for progress in ending the Syrian civil war, none of that will matter. The war is a gaping wound in the world which has destabilised the region and wider Europe. It is a complex conflict seemingly without end that has left people for years looking on feeling frustrated and helpless, or angry at the displaced millions. In reactions to the US strikes, a lot of people commenting on media and social media seemed to be uploading their own emotional projections about the war onto Trump's actions. Some people saw it as appropriate, limited, punishment for the Khan Sheikhoun attack. There was relief from Syrians that the Assad regime had finally taken a hit from the US. Perhaps more would follow. Long-time Syria watchers believed it was strategically good that Trump had demonstrated that military force was on the table. Obama's unwillingness to battle Bashar al-Assad as well as Isis had been seen as prolonging the war. Perhaps this has opened the door to intervention against the regime after the quarantined approach. Some saw Trump as refilling the Rubicon to deter future use of chemical weapons.Other people focused on whether the strikes were legal, or whether they sent a wider warning to North Korea and China, or whether the US was just repeating ineffective history. Some right-wing supporters of Trump were disappointed that he was not the isolationist they had believed in. It was quickly clear that the strikes were limited in scope and largely symbolic: A mini shock and awe. By Friday night NZT Reuters and AFP were reporting that planes were already using the base to take off on bombing raids in the countryside. By yesterday Khan Sheikhoun was being bombed again. Reports quickly surfaced on Friday from the BBC and ABC that Russians and Syrians were evacuated from the airbase before the strike. The Pentagon confirmed that Russia was notified in advance. Al Jazeera America producer Tony Karon tweeted: \"For anyone who thinks this is start of a war to topple Assad, note the care taken to minimise risk to his forces at target site\". Moscow has promised to strengthen Syria's anti-aircraft defences. It is also suspending a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their planes in Syria. Today Russia sent a warship to boost its battlegroup off the Syrian coast. Considering how both Trump and Putin would benefit from more perceived independence from each other, just how coordinated were the strikes? It is impossible to know just yet. Eurasia Group political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted: \"Assad gas attack vigorously denied by Kremlin & makes Putin looks weak v Assad (Iran matters..). US-Russia heading for trouble\". Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland smells a scam. \"How convenient that Trump, under fire for being Vladimir Putin's poodle, now stands up to him in Syria. How neatly this blows away all those allegations of secret links and election hacking. Yes, there have been ample statements of condemnation from Moscow, but those don't cost either side anything. The US appears to have given Russia sufficient warning to ensure their men weren't hit, and Russia used none of its ample capacity to hit back. It all worked out very nicely.\" HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO THEY CARRY? There has been a lot of debate on how much weight these strikes carry. If it is too obviously organised military theatre then can it really enforce a warning to the Syrian regime? Is Trump almost guaranteed to have to go further at some stage? And should Trump suddenly be seen as a 'strong' leader, having dropped 59 cruise missiles worth US$59 million, after decades of war. Zenko tweeted: \"US dropped 26,172 bombs in 2016. How does 59 more suddenly demonstrate US 'resolve,' 'credibility,' + 'leadership?'\" New York Times journalist Max Fisher wrote in a series of tweets: \"Still confused by argument that the US established anti-CW deterrence by demonstrating it will retaliate with negligibly damaging strikes. If this was executed competently and Russia given warnings, then strikes appear largely symbolic. Little impact on regime or its calculus. How exactly did these US strikes establish deterrence? Is this 'punishment' sufficient to change anything?\" Josh Barro of Business Insider asked: \"If you openly signal that the attack was symbolic, doesn't that undermine the symbolism?\" Naval War College professor Tom Nichols tweeted: \"This looks like a pinprick. It pops the balloon of thinking Syria is untouchable, but whether it deters anything is less clear.\" Former US Treasury terror finance analyst Jonathan Schanzer tweeted: \"FWIW, I think a limited, proportional response is a good first move. Doesn't solve Syria, but lets Assad/Iran know we are watching.\" Clifford May of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies tweeted: \"Also let's Russia know we're back in the game. N Korea, too, can no longer bank on US inaction, 'soft power' and talking as only responses.\" WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? For many experts the 'what's next' question is key. University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami tweeted: \"Within days, Trump's strike will look more and more ineffective, forcing a decision: escalate or live with perception of failure.\" Writer Max Boot tweeted: \"Now what? Is message that US will tolerate Assad as long as he doesn't use CW? Or is this prelude to larger strategy in Syria? If so what?\" Former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said that \"Trump biggest worry now; what if Assad defies him and uses chemical weapons again?\" Head of Foreign Policy Group, David Rothkopf, tweeted: \"Problem re: Trump & mil action is - he's impulsive and not strategic. Taking such action absent clear policies is where biggest risks arise. The 'what's next' component of Syria strike will reveal much about effectiveness & thinking of Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster, Pompeo team.\" Zenko said a 'rosy scenario' could see Assad deterred without the US being drawn further into the civil war. But he said \"I looked at 36 cases of limited US strikes: They achieve military goals 1/2 the time; political goals less than 10%.\" A Middle East veteran writer, Sam Dagher, tweeted: \"Without plan to remove Assad from power US strikes strengthen him as leader confronting Trump aggression.\" The editor of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, compared the President with his predecessor: \"Obama was known for an overly cerebral commitment to the notion of strategic patience. Trump seems more committed to a policy of glandular, non-strategic impatience. Obama may have been paralysed by a phobic reaction to the threat posed by the slippery slope. Donald Trump now finds himself dancing at the edge of the slippery slope his predecessor so assiduously avoided.\""}{"head": "The Syrian \u2018hell on earth\u2019 is a tangle of power plays unlikely to end soon", "classes": ["intro", "description"], "content": "THE war in Syria has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced millions, but there is a reason why the fighting won\u2019t end soon.A Russian call for a five-hour truce has failed to halt one of the most devastating campaigns of the Syrian war.\n\nResidents say government warplanes resumed striking the eastern Ghouta region after a brief lull.ONCE again, unfortunate civilians are trapped in the \u201chell on earth\u201d that the Syrian civil war has become. This time it is the turn of the 400,000 residents of Eastern Ghouta, 10km east of the capital Damascus. Latest reports put civilian casualties at 520 and thousands wounded under the heavy assault launched by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ground forces supported by Russian air strikes.It seems conditions in Syria are getting worse, and there is no end to the conflict.The end to any violent conflict comes when either the warring sides realise the devastation they cause and make peace; outside intervention sways the warring parties to end the conflict; or there are clear winners delivering a crushing defeat to their enemies.None of the warring factions seem to care about the devastation of the seven-year civil war. Almost the entire country is rubble \u2014 more than 400,000 people have died, there are 5 million Syrian refugees and more than 6 million displaced. Unfortunately, the peace option seems highly unlikely.There had been international intervention through peace initiatives since 2013, when the then US Secretary of State, John Kerry, lamented that Syria \u201cheads closer to an abyss, if not over the abyss and into chaos\u201d. It was a chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta that prompted the United Nations to pass a resolution in 2013 demanding the destruction of chemical stockpiles and giving impetus to peace talks in Geneva. All efforts to make progress on these talks were continually stalled. The parties failed to meet even as late as 2017, painfully expediting Mr Kerry\u2019s apocalyptic prediction.The Geneva talks were paralleled by a Russian-led peace initiative in Kazakhstan and later in Sochi. These talks could not have been expected to succeed, given that Russia\u2019s unconditional and active support of the Assad regime hampered any attempt at negotiating a peace deal.Apart from the vested interests and insincerity, the biggest stumbling block has been disagreement over who to include in the peace process.The US does not want Mr Assad or Iran involved; Turkey does not want the Kurdish People\u2019s Defence Unit (YPG); and Russia does not want any of the jihadist rebel groups.The sheer number of rebel groups is another issue. In the relatively small area of Eastern Ghouta alone, there are three rebel groups, which often bicker with one another.Since the conflict began in 2011, nearly 200 separate rebel groups have sporadically emerged. Although most of these later merged into larger entities, there are still too many groups. Their inclusion in any peace process has been problematic, because it is unclear who actually represents the Syrian opposition, not to mention the groups\u2019 refusal to sit at the same table.Then there is the thorny issue of ideological and religious differences. Shiite Syrians and a segment of secular Sunni Muslims support the Assad regime, whereas the largest chunk of the rebel groups are Salafi jihadists. The exceptions are the Kurdish YPG and the largely weakened Free Syrian Army.All along, Mr Assad\u2019s regime has been claiming it is fighting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other Salafi jihadist groups to keep Syria a modern secular state. Mr Putin is pushing Mr Assad to wipe out these groups, spurred by the deep fear they could mobilise radical Muslim groups within Russia\u2019s borders.The US and Europe are in the cognitive dissonance of wanting neither Mr Assad nor jihadist groups to gain control in Syria. They don\u2019t want Mr Assad, but they like his argument of protecting a modern secular Syria. The unspoken preference is for Mr Assad over any Jihadi rebel group.So, the lack of an effective peace intervention and the impossibility of parties sitting down to negotiate, leaves only the option of fighting it out until clear victors emerge.This leaves the Assad regime with a free run to assert itself as the only feasible and legitimate government in Syria, a possibility that may indeed eventuate.This is the strategic line the Assad regime has drawn thick on the ground. It explains why Assad forces have ignored the UN\u2019s 30-day ceasefire resolution. Mr Putin\u2019s disregard for the resolution, by reducing it to a farcical five-hour window, shows that neither Mr Assad nor Mr Putin wants the rebels to regroup and gain strength. They want a quick and absolute victory, even if it is a bloodbath.Just as it is almost certain that the rebels of Eastern Ghouta will fall, it is equally certain Assad forces will next intensify the siege of Idlib, a north-eastern city held by the Salafi jihadist rebel group Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This pattern will continue until all rebel groups are wiped out.It is unlikely there will be any fighting between Assad forces and the Kurdish YPG, as that would mean an open confrontation between Russia and the US. After the US supported the YPG, it successfully ended Islamic State\u2019s presence in eastern Syria.The US has made it clear it is there to stay, establishing a 30,000-strong border security force as a deterrent against IS regrouping, but more importantly to stop Mr Assad attacking Kurdish regions once he clears the ground of rebel groups in his territory.The wildcard in Syria is Turkey\u2019s unpredictable president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He aims to establish Turkey in north-eastern Syria as a third major player along with Russia and the US, by fighting alongside elements of the Free Syrian Army to capture the Kurdish-controlled district of Afrin.Whether Russia and the US will allow Mr Erdogan to realise his objectives remains to be seen. He may find he is out of his league when things get tough on the ground, forcing him out of Syria.The Syrian conflict will end only if the Russian-supported Assad regime wipes out all Salafi jihadist rebel groups and regains control of western Syria and its most important cities. This may be before the end of 2018. In the meantime, the international community should be prepared to lament more civilian casualties.Mehmet Ozalp is an Associate Professor in Islamic Studies, Director of The Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation and Executive Member of Public and Contextual Theology, Charles Sturt UniversityThis story originally appeared in The Conversation and has been republished here with permission.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Kurdish officials said the suicide bomber drove into a busy checkpoint. Photo: Getty ImagesTHIS is a complicated war. This is a messy, cruel war where neither side has much regard for civilian casualties.This war is not black-and-white. You might think it\u2019s the brave rebels versus the evil dictatorial regime, and that\u2019s part of the story. But it\u2019s not all of it. Not by a long way.Confused about Syria? Us too. But this quick 10-point explainer will help. To help us navigate this tragic conflict, we spoke to two Australians with a unique view on the troubled nation.We spoke to Dr Rodger Shanahan, former peacekeeper in Syria and non-resident Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy.And we spoke to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who this year travelled to Syria on a humanitarian mission. You can read his blog here at prayersforsyria.com.1. SyriaA country smaller than the state of Victoria with almost the exact same population as Australia (22.5 million to our 23 million) which borders Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon. Syria has both deserts and fertile areas and is steeped in history dating back to biblical times.2. The Syrian regimeThe Syrian Civil war is a conflict between its long-serving government and those seeking to boot it out of office. The Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar al-Assad.Unlike many regime leaders in the middle east middle, The Assad family is not religiously extreme. They are Alawites \u2013 a relatively obscure branch of Islam which is not particularly hard-line. So the people have not been protesting against hard-line Islamists, as happened in other countries which participated in the Arab Spring uprisings.But people are still angry at their government. As Rodger Shanahan points out, what they\u2019re angry about is the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms.3. The Civil War beginsRodger Shanahan says the catalyst was the jailing on March 6, 2011, of some children who painted anti-regime graffiti. Some were killed in detention, and this led to public protests which spread around the country \u2013 fuelled by the failure of the government to punish the perpetrators.Another theory says the war started with demonstrations which mirrored those in neighbouring countries, and which soon led to a security crackdown. In April 2011, the Syrian Army fired on demonstrators and the protests became a full-scale armed rebellion.4. The rebellion grows\u2026By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed. As Dr Shanahan explains, the FSA never existed before that. \u201cLocal areas formed their own militias with the aim of toppling the government without any co-ordination or centralised command or control,\u201d he says.\u201cThe militias were a combination of local area tribal groups, deserters from the military [who had been conscripted despite holding anti-government beliefs] and disaffected locals.\u201dThen a combination of Jihadists, some from Syria and some from elsewhere, joined the FSA. Some even came from the faraway Caucasus region \u2013 where accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev originally hailed from.So in other words, you had genuine Syrian freedom fighters joined by people with their own Islamist agendas. But because the FSA was underarmed and undermanned, they had little choice but to form a loose coalition with these volatile new kids on the revolutionary block.5. And pretty soon, bad guys on both sides are killing civilians\u2026As Father Dave Smith says, \u201cthe way it\u2019s been depicted the last couple of years, you get the impression the rebels are Robin Hood and his band of merry men, and that all they want is freedom and justice for all. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201dFather Dave illustrates his point with a communication he had with a Syrian woman which he published on his blog. The woman\u2019s name is Ghinwa and she wrote by text:\u201cThe situation is very bad now in Latakia province. 7 Alawite villages were massacred. We know about the killing of 136 villagers all killed on sectarian bases. A friend of mind lost 21 member of his relatives.\u201cAll of my friends who were documenting the name and the events of massacres in Latakia against Alawites are now being threatened to be killed by FSA and Al Nusra terrorists \u2026 On TV we are shown something different. It is only a propaganda. They\u2019re trying to say that Alawites are not being killed or displaced. The truth is being hidden by mass media. .. This is sick\u2026 My sister now is very ill \u2026 I guess a part of her illness is caused by sadness \u2026 we are afraid.\u201dA quick recap. Alawites are the ethnicity of the ruling family. The fact they were allegedly being killed by rebel groups suggests the rebels are not all angels.6. Civilian casualties\u201cThere are accusations of atrocities on both sides,\u201d Rodger Shanahan confirms. We should believe some of them, absolutely. There\u2019s no accurate confirmation, but it\u2019s a nasty horrible civil war with people on both sides getting killed.Dr Shanahan says there is evidence that opposition car bombs have killed countless civilians in the name of taking out a government target. But there are equally distressing reports that government soldiers executed civilians. Others, shockingly, were executed for taking a moral stance and failing to follow orders to execute civilians.Like we said, it\u2019s a bloody mess. Literally. The death toll in the war is now said to be well over 100,000.7. The president\u2019s wifeAllow us to break up this tale with a story of the president\u2019s wife. Her name is Asma al-Assad and she was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. She\u2019s smart, glamorous and she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 \u2013 just months before he became president.In March 2011, the American version of Vogue magazine ran a long, glowing profile of Asma al-Assad. Talk about bad timing. The story was soon removed from Vogue\u2019s website and the journalist who wrote it tried to cover her tracks by penning a separate story elsewhere entitled \u201cFirst Lady of Hell\u201d.Even as the Civil war rages, the Assad family remains popular with many middle class Syrians, especially urbanised Sunni Muslims, says Dr Rodger Shanahan. \u201cThey still prefer him to the opposition,\u201d he says.8. Refugee hellThe United Nations estimates that more than 1.5 million refugees have now fled Syria. Father David Smith visited several camps across the border in Lebanon \u2013 a country whose population of 4.3 million is bulging with the influx of a total of nearly 2 million Palestinian and Syrian refugees.\u201cThe camps I saw were deeply impressive,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cEvery Palestinian family took in two, maybe three Syrian families. These included polygamous families which presented a whole new problem. The wives often lived in separate houses in Syria but now they were not just under the same roof but sleeping on the same floor. The domestic violence and rape problems are enormous. I was deeply impressed with camp and people running it.\u201d9. Chemical weaponsJust who unleashed the chemical weapons attack which killed hundreds of children and other civilians last week \u2013 and why? UN weapons inspectors arrived yesterday with a mandate to find that out. And when they do, it will affect what the world does next.\u201cThey have a mandate to say whether a chemical attack occurred but not to apportion blame,\u201d Dr Shanahan cautions. \u201cFirst, they have to establish whether an incident occurred [it is still disputed by some] and at what level the action was authorised. It is plausible that Assad didn\u2019t authorise it but a local commander did.\u201d10. What happens nextThe world waits. \u201cYou would think the way diplomatic manoeuvrings are going that if there is some kind of military strike it would be quite limited,\u201d Dr Shanahan says. \u201cIt would be punitive, not designed to tip the military balance.\u201dIn other words, no Iraq-style invasion or prolonged Western intervention.And Father Dave\u2019s opinion of what comes next? He doesn\u2019t know. But he\u2019s praying. He speaks of a man he met in Syria who said he\u2019s gone \u201cfrom unemployment to slavery\u201d.

Now the world awaits Bashar al-Assad\u2019s next move.THE brutal dictator behind one of the worst atrocities the world has seen this century got the job by accident. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine.But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career.Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade.When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded.But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants.ACCIDENTAL RULERThe al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father\u2019s death.According to the Lowy Institute\u2019s Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change.\u201cHe had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\u201d Dr Shanahan said.But that didn\u2019t happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government.\u201cYou can\u2019t open up free speech in a closed political system,\u201d he said.GLAMOROUS MODERN WIFEAsma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 \u2014 just months before he became president.From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial \u2014 the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni.As Syria\u2019s First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women\u2019s rights and education.The couple have three children.RISE OF A DICTATORAssad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists.But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent.One of Assad\u2019s first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reformsBut the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving.Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands.A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed.The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad\u2019s Ba\u2019ath Party holding effective power.The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied.Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013.Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria.The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province.SPARKING A WARThe Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam.While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school.Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad\u2019s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.REBELS OR ISLAMIC STATE?Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra.And the messy, long and complicated war isn\u2019t just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot actually.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city.But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL?The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib.The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces.IS ASSAD LIKED?Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask.Domestically he\u2019s generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments.Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him.But millions of others have suffered.Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries.But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war.Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey.\u201cIraqis have remained neutral with their support of Assad.\u201d Dr Shanahan said.\u201cJordanians just wish it would all go away and Lebanon have always had a funny stance with Syria.\u201cThe Gulf states oppose Assad.\u201dWILL HE LOSE POWER?Dr Shanahan said the Gulf States have been pressuring Assad to step down for years and that hasn\u2019t worked.However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story.\u201cThe US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don\u2019t see this situation changing anytime soon,\u201d he said.debra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

But the before and after photos are pretty hard to forget.We take a look at how Syria and the city Aleppo has change over the last six years with the conflict of war.ONCE regarded as a political and military heavyweight in the Middle East, this country was rich in trade, ancient archaeological sites and boasted an innovative IT industry.Today, its cities and towns are in pieces and the war in Syria has become the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.With more than 300,000 Syrians killed and six million people who have fled or displaced, the war in Syria was last night described on Q&A as \u201cthe biggest story on the planet\u201d. Host Tony Jones said \u201cwe rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people\u201d.Syria descended into full-scale civil war in 2012, causing about half the country\u2019s pre-war population to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadists.And while the world now sees a country devastated by years of war and left in ruins, it wasn\u2019t always this way.Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt told Q&A that Syria was \u201cquite a normal country\u201d eight years ago.He\u2019s not the only one, many people remember a country that was once thriving.One refugee Tara, who fled Syria in 2011, told Amnesty International her country had one of the oldest and sophisticated literary traditions in the world along with a vibrant film industry.She also revealed how Syria has been part of the major empires of history, including Egyptian, Persian and Roman.Syria\u2019s cities were filled with souks and bustling marketplaces which served as a crucial meeting and cultural point while bakeries and sweet shops were found on most corners.Today Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, has all but been obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Once the beating heart of Syria\u2019s industrial and commercial industries, it has witnessed some of the most brutal violence of the country\u2019s six-year war.Before and after photos of the Old City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, show the full extent of the catastrophic destruction which has taken place.Aleppo was pummelled by air strikes last December, shrinking the rebel enclave just days ahead of parallel talks in France and Switzerland which aimed to save the Syrian city from \u201ccomplete\u201d destruction.The city\u2019s east \u2014 a rebel stronghold since 2012 \u2014 has been the target of a major assault by forces loyal to President Bashar\u2019s Russian-backed regime.During last December\u2019s air strikes, Ibrahim Abu al-Leith, spokesman for the White Helmets rescue force inside Aleppo described the terror many left behind faced.\u201cThe streets are full of people under the rubble. They are dying because we can\u2019t get them out,\u201d he told AFP.As news.com.au reported last December, the war in Syria has been described as the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.While the Syrian army announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26, the conflict is far from over.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

A Western perspective on the crisis", "classes": ["intro", "description"], "content": "AS DESPERATE people flee in their millions, Australia is launching headlong into this hell on Earth. This is what they are running from.ALMOST exactly two years ago, as the full horror of Syria\u2019s civil war revealed itself to the world, news.com.au published a basic explainer piece.That piece, entitled 10 simple points to help you understand the Syria conflict, went on to be one of the most clicked stories ever produced by this website.To this day, people continue to read it. At any given moment in the day or night, 40 or 50 people from around the world are reading it as they try to comprehend the desperately complicated Syrian situation. Those numbers have surged in recent days and weeks for obvious reasons.But our original piece is now out of date. So much has happened since 2013, including this afternoon\u2019s announcement that Australia will carry out air strikes against Islamic State (IS).That\u2019s why we\u2019ve produced this update, with fresh comment from the same two Australian experts we consulted two years ago.We\u2019ve again spoken to Dr Rodger Shanahan, a former peacekeeper in Syria who is now a Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, as well as Associate Professor at the National Security College at the Australian National University (ANU).And we spoke once more to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who has now made four humanitarian missions to Syria, the most recent in July. You can read Father Dave\u2019s blog here at prayersforsyria.com1. A reminder of Syria and its origins as a countrySyria is a middle eastern nation with a small strip of Mediterranean coastline. Its overall area is a little smaller than the United Kingdom. Syria first became an independent nation in 1945 and has been formally known as the Arab Republic of Syria since 1991.Though it has pretences of being democratic, Syria has been led by the al-Assad family for 45 years. Hafez al-Assad ruled from 1970 to 2000. His first son died in a car crash and his second, Bashar al-Assad, has been president since 2000.2. How the civil war startedIn 2011, the people of several middle eastern and North African countries rose up against their leaders in a movement which became known as the Arab Spring. Many of the overthrown leaders were hard-line Islamists. Syria\u2019s ruling family have never been that. The Assad family are Alawites \u2014 a branch of Islam which is relatively liberal.But despite living under a regime which allowed religious and other freedoms, many Syrians were still no fans of Bashar al-Assad. Angry about the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms, and emboldened by the Arab Spring uprisings, a series of anti-government protests began.For several reasons the protests soon turned ugly. A key flashpoint was the deaths (in detention) of some children who had painted anti-regime graffiti. There were also moments when the government brutally cracked down on protests, firing into the crowd.Soon, ordinary Syrians took up arms. Many of them were disenchanted former members of Assad\u2019s military. Others were ordinary citizens. As things escalated into a full scale civil war, they were joined by a ragtag bunch of jihadists and others, who crossed borders to join the action on the side of the anti-government rebels.3. And the war raged on and on: it is impossibly messyIn the two years since we first tackled this issue, the Syrian Civil War has turned into a conflict so complicated, even the experts admit it almost defies description. It\u2019s also a war no one is really winning or can win.\u201cThe war is at stalemate right now with the Syrian government in control of western and central Syria around Damascus, and with patchy control over parts of Aleppo in the north,\u201d explains Dr Shanahan. \u201cIslamic state is more eastern Syria-focused but it\u2019s also in northern Syria.\u201cThere are also a variety of groups like Jabhat al-Nusra which is Al-Qaeda aligned. The bottom line is it\u2019s bloody complex.\u201d4. To make matters more complicated, everyone now has different aimsIn truth, this war was about Syrians versus the Assad regime for about five minutes. Then came the jihadists and then came IS, which as Dr Shanahan explains, wants to expand the caliphate it has loosely established in Iraq and parts of Syria across the whole of Syria.A caliphate, by the way, is a region governed by hard-line Islamic rule.But as Dr Shanahan explains, the problem here is competing goals. Every player in this war wants something different.\u201cThe non Islamist [rebel] groups don\u2019t like Assad, IS want to expand the caliphate, groups like Jabhat al-Nusra want Islamic rule in Syria under their leadership, other Islamist groups want Islamic government although what that looks like and how it might be achieved is never articulated. But they all want Islamic rule in one way, shape, or form.\u201d5. So basically you\u2019ve got an unwinnable war.Dr Shanahan again: \u201cI think what will end up happening is something short of the collapse of the Assad regime. A reasonable outcome you\u2019d think is a \u2018regime lite\u2019 where Assad is not the ruler at an agreed time in the future, and where some opposition elements are incorporated in the government and military. How you get there is the difficulty.\u201d6. Meanwhile the bodies stack upTwo years ago, the death toll including civilians and combatants was around 100 thousand. That figure is now generally estimated to be 240 thousand. That\u2019s about 1400 Syrians killed as a direct or indirect result of this conflict each week over the last two years. To help you put those numbers in perspective, Syria\u2019s overall population is almost identical to Australia\u2019s 23 million.7. And the number of refugees is staggering. So why are they heading to Europe now?By most measures, it appears that as many as 11 million Syrians have been displaced. Of those, 4.1 million have fled the country and been registered as refugees with the UNHCR. The real number of refugees outside Syria is probably much higher.Why are they heading to Europe now?\u201cMy understanding is that the refugees are moving from Turkey [which shares a southern border with Syria] and my understanding is they are moving from there [towards Europe] because people smugglers have found a route less dangerous and cheaper,\u201d Dr Shanahan says.\u201cPeople can\u2019t move in that kind of mass movement without people smugglers who have made the journey more accessible and cheaper. There has been no massive escalation in the war itself. People are just saying \u2018we can make it to Europe now so let\u2019s do it\u2019. It\u2019s a case of risk versus return. It\u2019s also summer now in the northern hemisphere, which is a much better time to make a dangerous trip like this than winter.Unfortunately, as we all saw with the tragic case of drowned toddler Aylan Kurdi, the risk side of that equation remains devastatingly real.8. Meanwhile, what\u2019s life like for those who remain in Syria?With four humanitarian missions under his belt, Father David Smith has some amazing insights into the lives of those who both literally and figuratively soldier on in Syria.He recalls one man he met who joined the rebels because they paid 50 dollars a month and all the cigarettes he could smoke. But he soon figured out that his commander was not even a Syrian (and was probably IS aligned). \u201cI had gone from poverty and unemployment to slavery and beheadings,\u201d the man told Father Dave.Another man told Father Dave, with his young pretty wife beside him and baby bouncing on his knee, how he\u2019d done his bit for the army by killing up to 1500 people. He wasn\u2019t boasting. He was merely acknowledging how the moral goalposts have shifted in the mess that is present day Syria.Yet the country itself is far from entirely dysfunctional. \u201cSyria is going a lot better than Iraq thanks be to God,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cThere is a fully functioning bureaucracy. Unlike Lebanon, where garbage has not been collected for months, the garbage is collected in Syria.\u201dAs the country somehow stays functional in most areas, its people maintain their spirits.\u201cEverywhere we went on our most recent trip in July, we saw thousands of kids, and all had fire in the eyes. They were full of life and spirit.\u201cThe streetlife was extraordinary, despite no lighting at night. People were dancing and drinking and saying \u2018I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to be alive, we might as well enjoy life\u2019.\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t see was a sense of resignation,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cThere is a very strong sense of patriotic solidarity in Syria. People are gathering around the flag and around Assad, even if it\u2019s not to do with him as a person or any decisions he has made.\u201dIt would be ironic if this war, which started as an anti-Assad crusade, ends up making people feel that Assad is the safe option. But there is evidence that the chaos caused by all the various factions in this war may produce exactly that result among the Syrians left behind.It\u2019s doubly ironic given Dr Shanahan\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe one thing unites all the opposition groups, whether Islamists or Free Syrian Army, is that Assad must leave\u201d.Yet Dr Shanahan concedes that Assad may well represent \u201cif nothing else, stability in a time of chaos\u201d.9. What about Russia, the Saudis and other external players like the US and Australia?In short, there is strong evidence the Saudis are funding IS and others involved in Syria. Remember that Syria\u2019s Assad regime are Shia Muslims while the Saudi regime and most Saudis are Sunni Muslims. So the Saudi desire to replace a Shia regime with Sunni Islam is just one of the complications which deeply underpins this conflict.Iran is also in the mix. What you need to know about Iran is that it is more than 90 per cent Shia. So it has a natural ally with Syria\u2019s rulers and natural enemies elsewhere in the Middle East and Gulf region. So Iran has strong reasons to be supporting the ruling regime.Russia is an interesting player. It has a base in the Syrian port of Tartus, from where it is just over 1000 nautical miles to Russia\u2019s Black Sea naval bases. Russia supports the Assad regime, which the west does not. Remember, Assad is said to have committed atrocities against his own citizens, including the use of chemical weapons (a claim which is disputed). So the west is not exactly Assad\u2019s best friend.But nor is the west a friend of the rebels, given the rebels are such a loose, disparate collective which includes IS. In fact we want to bomb IS.10. So should we bomb IS? Will this in some way help stop the war?\u201cThe Americans\u2019 grand scheme is to degrade IS to relieve pressure on Syrian army units and make room for other people that they\u2019ve trained,\u201d Dr Shanahan explains.With Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing a series of air strikes on IS in Syria, experts like Dr Shanahan remain unconvinced of what they\u2019ll achieve.\u201cWhy should Australia bomb Syria? Australia has only got six aircraft. What operational effect will that have? There has just been no strategic intent. The government is wanting to show solidarity with the Americans, but it\u2019s not going to have any kind of operational effect.\u201dAbout the only thing we do know for sure is that Syria remains a mess. We\u2019d like to offer you a more hopeful conclusion. But the main reason the world has been standing back and not doing much in Syria is because it\u2019s unclear how to make a difference.That\u2019s one reason why the world\u2019s attention has swung to the refugee crisis. In this area at least, it\u2019s a little clearer how to contribute in a positive way.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why Syria has remained such a combustible mix. Photo: GettySYRIA was the last outpost of Communist Russia\u2019s imperial dreams.President Vladimir Putin did not want to let it go.Now, according to an assessment published in the professional journal of the US Army, the  Military Review, he\u2019s won.By direct implication, this implies a serious strategic setback for the United States.The Syrian Civil War has seen hundreds of thousands killed in more than 12 years of fighting.It was sparked by an uprising during what was then known as the \u201cArab Spring\u201d \u2014 a democratic surge among the newly social-media linked citizens of the Middle East.But the Arab Winter has since well and truly set in.US trained and supplied Syrian rebels have failed to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, they spent much of their force rolling back Islamic State.Assad himself has found renewed security in Moscow\u2019s embrace.\u201cThe Syrian conflict will likely enter a new phase in 2018, as both Islamic State and the Syrian opposition cease to be relevant forces, and the two coalitions seek to negotiate a postconflict settlement,\u201d the assessment reads.\u201cWhile it is far from assured that any settlement acceptable to the principle domestic and international players can be struck, for now the main outcome of this war is that President Bashar al-Assad will stay, but the Syria that existed before the war is gone.\u201dWAKING THE BEARPost Cold-War Russia has been concerned by the United States\u2019 ongoing interventions worldwide.It didn\u2019t like the idea of military intervention in Libya to oust Ghadaffis\u2019 regime. And the prospect of assertive \u201cregime change\u201d in its former client state of Syria was even more unpalatable.This appeared to be the case in 2011, when then President of the United States Barack Obama declared President Assad a dictator and demanded he step aside.Russia immediately set about blocking any intervention in Syria through the United Nations, and began quietly restocking Assad\u2019s arsenal.But soon Assad found himself in trouble.His forces had retreated to a few coastal and border cities. Rebels held much of Syria\u2019s heartland. And the black flag of Islamic State was rolling in from the Iraq desert.So, in 2015, Moscow directly intervened.It sent in its combat jets.\u201cRussia has only been directly involved in this conflict since September 2015, but its intervention has radically changed the war\u2019s outcome,\u201d the US Army publication states. \u201cThe natural question is whether Russia has, in fact, won a victory.\u201dPUTIN\u2019S GAMBITMoscow, the assessment argues, didn\u2019t want to look weak.It was struggling to adapt to international pressure and sanctions imposed after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the shadow-invasion of eastern Ukraine.\u201cRather than giving in to Western pressure and offering concessions on Ukraine, Moscow looked to Syria to broaden the confrontation on terms more favourable to itself,\u201d the article says. \u201cEventually, Russia hoped its Syrian intervention could force Washington and its European allies to abandon Ukraine-related sanctions and diplomatic isolation in the interests of achieving a negotiated settlement with Russia over Syria.\u201dSince 2015, Russian forces have shored up Assad\u2019s front lines.There have been few retreats. Now, his troops are advancing once again.And Russian bombers are frequently seen in the skies of the last rebel strongholds, such as the city of Ghouta.RELATED: Russia\u2019s Su-57 stealth fighter faces-off against US F-22\u201cA successful intervention could offer victory on three fronts: preventing US-backed regime change in Syria, breaking out of political isolation and forcing Washington to deal with Russia as an equal, and demonstrating at home that Russia is a great power on the main stage of international politics,\u201d the US army assessment states. \u201cMoscow hoped Syria would offer a new and more favourable front, where the United States could be outmanoeuvred in the broader confrontation.\u201dNow, in 2018, Assad\u2019s position is once again secure.Islamic State is all but defeated.US-supported rebel forces are being rolled back.The Kurd separatist ethnic group in the north is buckling under a Turkish invasion.And US/Coalition combat jets and ground-forces can do little but look on.In this broad context, it does look as though Moscow can claim some sort of victory.MOSCOW\u2019S METHODS\u201cRussia has become a potential powerbroker, and perhaps a balancer against US influence, even if it did not embark on the Syrian campaign with those goals in mind,\u201d the Army press article states.Achieving such a goal was not easy.Moscow had to destroy the Syrian Rebels\u2019 capacity to fight. It had to fend off concerns from Turkey, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\u201cThe risks of escalation to direct conflict between the intervening powers were considerable, as underscored by Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons in March 2017, resulting in a prompt retaliatory US cruise missile strike, or the Turkish shoot down of a Russian Su-24M2 in November 2016,\u201d the article highlights.RELATED: US troops clash with Russian mercenaries in SyriaMoscow-controlled media was prolific in showing images of its Su-30 strike fighters and Su-24 bombers on the runway of the Hmeimim Air Base. Much ado was made about a foray by Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier, Kuznetzov, with its battlefleet into the Eastern Mediterranean.And cruise-missile strikes from Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers, along with those fired from submarines and warships, repeatedly made the headlines.Meanwhile, 2000 of its mercenaries and 3000 soldiers were on the ground in Syria, ensuring pressure was being applied where it was needed most.All the while, the battle against US-backed \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels was being painted by Moscow as just another act in the war against \u201cterrorism\u201d.TRUMP\u2019S CAPITULATION\u201cOver time, Moscow achieved success on both the military and political fronts, coercing adversaries and negotiating changes to their positions one by one, though the pathway to this outcome was hardly a smooth or straightforward one,\u201d the authors note. \u201cRussia\u2019s success is not unqualified, but at the time of this writing, it appears that if the campaign in Syria is not a victory for Russia, it is certainly a defeat for those who opposed the Russian-led coalition.\u201dBut all is not clear-cut for Moscow.The US army highlights it is not truly in control of its Syria-Iran coalition.Which makes it vulnerable to fallout from their independent actions.\u201c(The) latest declaration of victory, ahead of the March 2018 presidential election, is fraught with risk since Russian forces are not just staying but further expanding the infrastructure at Tartus and Hmeimim,\u201d the assessment reads.International sanctions are still in place. And Russia is becoming increasingly associated with Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attacks.But it also notes Moscow has won international acceptance of its role as a key player in Syria\u2019s future.And with US President Donald Trump now telegraphing a rapid and complete withdrawal of US assets in Syria \u201cvery soon\u201d, this would leave President Vladimir Putin as the last man standing on top of the pile of rubble that remains behind.\u201cIn sum, Russia appears to have won at least a partial victory in Syria, and done so with impressive efficiency, flexibility, and co-ordination between military and political action,\u201d the assessment concludes. \u201cOn the one hand, Russia\u2019s embrace of the Assad regime and its Iranian allies, its relative indifference to civilian casualties, and its blanket hostility to antiregime opposition groups are fundamentally at odds with widely held US views on Syria. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s \u201clean\u201d strategy, adaptable tactics, and co-ordination of military and diplomatic initiatives offer important lessons for the conduct of any military intervention in as complex and volatile an environment as the Middle East.\u201dNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Activist reports suggest that a number of pro-Assad forces, mostly Lebanese and Iraqi militiamen, were killed in the car bombing attack. Such incidents occurred during the daytime hours of December 14. Activists inside the city have said that clashes came to a halt during the late evening hours of December 14, just hours ahead of planned evacuations for wounded civilians out of the city. Credit: YouTube/Jaish al-Fateh via StoryfulIT HAS been a long and bloody conflict leaving hundreds of thousands dead. But despite the Syrian government claiming a victory in Aleppo, its problems are far from over.Thousands of civilians remain trapped and face a desperate fight for survival just days after President Bashar al-Assad announced the Syrian army regained control of the city from rebel forces.The once thriving commercial centre has been reduced to a war zone, and many of its once famous buildings and monuments left in ruins after five long and brutal years of civil war.So how did it get this way?WHAT\u2019S GOING ON?The Syrian army on Monday announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26.Along with Aleppo, the Syrian government also controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria, Deir Az Zor, most of the territory along the border with Lebanon as well as most of the northwestern coast. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State and Kurdish forces.IS THERE STILL FIGHTING?Yes, despite Assad claiming a victory in Aleppo, the city remains in the grip of conflict and confusion.Just today, a ceasefire to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held neighbourhoods of Aleppo unravelled, once again raising the spectre of a bloody end to the battle for Syria\u2019s largest city.Residents reported shelling and brutal bombing runs had resumed while Assad opponents accused the government and its allies of scuttling the deal by adding new conditions, including the lifting of a rebel siege on two pro-government Shiite villages in nearby Idlib province. However, hours after it crumbled, the rebels insist the deal was back on.HOW DID THE CIVIL WAR START?In 2011, Syria was caught up in the Arab Spring uprising which saw Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak toppled from power.That March, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad\u2019s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.WHAT WERE THEY ANGRY ABOUT?The Assad family has held power in the country since 1971.The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?Rebels seized eastern Aleppo in July 2012, dividing the city, resulting in intense fighting and bombs being dropped on the densely populated rebel-held east, causing an estimated one million civilians to flee. Another half million were displaced.Things got messier in August after insurgents gained control of the Aleppo-Damascus highway, tightening the siege on the government part of the city.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot, not only does the Syrian government have rebels to contend with but also Islamic State forces as well.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in the eastern part of the city.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.Around 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHO\u2019S INVOLVED?Aside from Syrian forces, Russia, Iran and even Lebanon have bolstered Assad in the civil war.In October 2015, Russia began air strikes while Syrian troops launched an offensive around Aleppo. Iraqi, Lebanese and Iranian militias also threw their weight behind the government.Meanwhile several Arab states, along with Turkey, provided support to rebel groups in Syria, Al Jazeera reported.The US has accused President Assad of being responsible for widespread atrocities and want to see him out of power. So far though it has tried to avoid taking part in any attacks which might directly benefit the Syrian army.It supports Syria\u2019s main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, and also provides limited military assistance to moderate rebels, the BBC reported.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) receives support from the US Central Intelligence Agency, while the Kurdish Popular Defence Units (YPG and YPJ) receive support from the US Department of Defence, according to Quartz.In September 2014, the US joined the international coalition against Islamic State but has avoided intervening in battles between rebel and Assad forces.DEADLY COST TO HUMANITYPeople on both sides have been killed, and the death toll from the civil war is now estimated to stand at 312,000 according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The toll includes more than 53,000 rebels and nearly 110,000 pro-regime fighters, among them more than 60,000 Syrian soldiers. But it also includes tens of thousands of Syrian militiamen, members of Lebanon\u2019s Shiite Hezbollah movement and other foreign fighters.However according to Al Jazeera the death toll from the conflict is closer to 450,000 with 12 million Syrians displaced.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called on the Syrian government, Russia and Iran to urgently allow civilians to escape Aleppo.\u201cWe have collectively failed the people of Syria,\u201d he said at a UN Security Council meeting. \u201cHistory will not easily absolve us.\u201dBoth the west and the UN claim civilians have been intentionally killed, but the Syrian army has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured.It is also feared civilians are too scared to flee and thousands remain hidden, trusting neither side to keep them safe.WASN\u2019T THERE ALREADY A CEASE FIRE?Yes, in February this year Russia and the US brokered a ceasefire with rebels that excluded extremists, however it was short-lived and it collapsed just two months later.In July the government and allied forces imposed a full siege on eastern Aleppo, home to an estimated 250,000 people. Rebel fighters broke the siege for a couple of weeks but it was reimposed by August. The following month another ceasefire negotiated by Russia and the US held for a few days, but talks to bring in aid got nowhere.Soon after Russia announced it was suspending air strikes in eastern Aleppo so aid and medical evacuations could get in and out. But rebels rejected the offer and the UN announced it couldn\u2019t carry out medical evacuations due to security concerns.WHAT NOW?Last month, the Syrian army launched a renewed and intensified aerial campaign. Syrian troops and allied forces launched a major ground offensive, causing rebel defences to crumble and thousands to flee.A ceasefire, brokered by Turkey and Russia, was announced overnight to allow the evacuation of rebels and civilians and effectively surrendering the city to the government.But it never truly took hold on the ground and government shelling continues.\u2014 with AP and AFPdebra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Now shocking statistics reveal the extent of the damage done to Syria\u2019s lost generation. IT REPRESENTS the greatest humanitarian challenge of our time. Five years of intense fighting has plunged a once vibrant country into darkness. The destruction and despair wrought by the Syrian Civil War has caused a \u201csystematic\u201d obliteration of infrastructure and population. Such is the backward direction of the country, that from 2010 to 2015, the average life expectancy fell by a staggering 20 years.Just five years ago the life expectancy of a child born in Syria was 75.9 years, but that number has since fallen to an estimated 55.7 years. In contrast, the average life expectancy in Australia is 82.2 years.A complete death toll in the war is impossible to pin down, but estimates from aid organisations and the United Nations put the number at more than 270,000 people \u2014 thousands more than the number killed in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.According to aid organisation Mercy Corps, \u201chalf the country\u2019s pre-war population \u2014 more than 11 million people \u2014 have been killed or forced to flee their homes\u201d.The UN estimates close to four million Syrians have fled the country \u2014 a trend that has fuelled an incredibly difficult European refugee crisis that has dominated global headlines.A further seven million Syrians are believed to be internally displaced due to the fighting, and those left behind face almost impossible circumstances.A shocking 80 per cent of Syrians are now deemed to be living in poverty. More than three million have lost their jobs since fighting broke out in 2010, according to a 2015 UN-backed report.Unemployment has surged from 14.9 per cent in 2011 to 57.7 per cent at the end of 2014.\u201cThirty per cent of the population have descended into abject poverty where households struggle to meet the basic food needs to sustain bare life,\u201d the report said.Of the millions displaced and suffering, Syria\u2019s children are bearing the brunt of the crisis and have been dubbed the country\u2019s \u201clost generation\u201d.An estimated four million Syrian children are out of school or any formal education at the moment, adding to the disastrous long term effects of the conflict.\u201cThe scale of the crisis for children is growing all the time, which is why there are now such fears that Syria is losing a whole generation of its youth,\u201d said Peter Salama, regional director of the UN\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund.A majority of the country live half their lives under a blanket of darkness as the damage accumulated in the war has caused 83 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity to be cut.An image taken from space at night shows how the lights have slowly faded from the night sky over Syria.The images above were taken by a team of researchers from Wuhan University in China from satellites 800km above the earth.\u201cThese satellite images help us understand the suffering and fear experienced by ordinary Syrians as their country is destroyed around them,\u201d said Dr Xi Li, the lead researcher on the project, in a statement.While the emotional toll of the ongoing civil war is impossible to define, the financial cost is so far projected to have surpassed $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue.\u201cWith the economic and structural losses and the destruction of oil resources, agriculture, industry, trade, infrastructure and the displacement of millions of people, the total losses suffered by Syria easily exceeds 200 billion dollars,\u201d the head of the Syrian Economic Task Force, Osama Kadi, said last year.Homs, the third largest city in Syria, has been reduced to rubble and today shows a faint flicker of the life it once held. Drone footage circulated online last week shows the devastation suffered by the city and led prominent Middle East commentator, Maajid Nawaz, to comment: \u201cAre we fighting to control cities of rubble?\u201dTHE LATESTPeace talks stalled last week as the Syrian army secured a major battlefield victory against insurgent rebels, and Russia vowed to continue its aerial bombardment in support of the Assad regime.The continued fighting marred the fragile peace talks, which rebel groups said they would refuse to join until Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stopped attacking Syrian rebels.Peace talks are set to resume on February 25.The aid group Mercy Corps says intensified air strikes and fighting around Aleppo have cut off the main humanitarian route into the Syrian city, and that tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing north toward the border with Turkey.David Evans, Mercy Corps\u2019 regional program director for the Middle East, said in a statement on Thursday that the group\u2019s operations in northern Syria \u201chave been effectively sliced in half.\u201dTens of thousands of Syrians who fled the Russia-backed government offensive in Aleppo are now stranded at the border with Turkey.Turkey has vowed to help the crowds of people, including many women and children, but has not opened its borders and aid agencies have warned they are facing a \u201cdesperate\u201d situation as they wait for help.\u201cTurkey has reached the limit of its capacity to absorb the refugees,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told CNN Turk television.\u201cBut in the end, these people have nowhere else to go. Either they will die beneath the bombings ... or we will open our borders.\u201cWe are not in a position to tell them not to come. If we do, we would be abandoning them to their deaths.\u201dTurkey\u2019s Oncupinar border crossing, which faces the Bab al-Salama frontier post inside Syria, remained closed on Sunday as thousands of refugees gathered there for a third day waiting for the gate to open.One small piece of good news came last week as world leaders pledged more than $US10 billion to help fund schools, shelter and jobs for the refugees of Syria\u2019s civil war.The money was pledged following an aid conference in London last Thursday (Friday AEDT) and, according to British Prime Minister David Cameron, \u201cwill save lives, will give hope, will give people the chance of a future\u201d.\u201cNever has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.\u201cThe promises of long-term funding and loans mean that humanitarian and development partners will be able to work together to get children back into school, design employment programs and begin rebuilding infrastructure.\u201dTHE NUMBERS\u25cf More than 270,000 killed\u25cf Life expectancy reduced by 20 years\u25cf Four million Syrians are external refugees\u25cf Nearly seven million are displaced inside the country\u25cf Four out of five Syrians live in poverty\u25cf Unemployment has risen to nearly 60 per cent\u25cf Four million children are missing out on formal schooling\u25cf More than 80 per cent of country\u2019s electricity has been cut\u25cf More than $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue\u25cf Thirteen million in need of assistance\u25cf Largest current refugee crisis in the worldNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Here\u2019s why we\u2019re all turning a blind eye. The affluent and third world countries seem to barely acknowledge conflict in Syria due to how it is as seen as hopeless. The Australian's Paul Kelly addresses the tragedy. Courtesy: Q&AIT\u2019S been dubbed the \u201cbiggest story on the planet\u201d.So why does the West largely turn a blind eye to the deadliest conflict of the 21st century?That was one of the questions put to the panel on the ABC\u2019s Q&A program on Monday night.Host Tony Jones said the war in Syria was \u201cprobably the biggest story on the planet but we rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people\u201d.According to Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt, Syria was \u201cquite a normal country\u201d about eight years ago.\u201cI was there and met President Assad,\u201d Ms Thorning Schmidt said.\u201cIt was beginning to become a normal country. Now we have six million people who have fled and so many children who are traumatised perhaps for life about what has happened there.\u201dMore than 300,000 Syrians have been killed in the ongoing armed conflict which started with anti-government protests before escalating into a full-scale civil war on July 19, 2012.The War in Syria has caused millions of Syrians \u2014 about half the country\u2019s pre-war population \u2014 to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadist militants including those from Islamic State.The widespread destruction of infrastructure has seen Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, all but obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Ms Thorning Schmidt said the organisation was calling on all countries to engage in a Security Council agreement.\u201c(It includes) rules of war that the warring partner will live by where you don\u2019t bomb schools, you don\u2019t bomb hospitals, you get access for humanitarian workers to get in and pick children and people up to get them to safe spaces and hospitals,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot we could be doing and it\u2019s been very, very difficult to work in Aleppo and other places.\u201d\u201cIt is important that we just sit back and urge everyone who is a warring party in that conflict, and there\u2019s a few, to just live by some very simple rules where you should not be bombing a hospital.\u201cYou should not be bombing humanitarian aid workers that are trying to get access into the cities, you should not be bombing schools.\u201d\u2018THE DEGREE OF DAMAGE TO HUMAN LIFE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE\u2019The Australian editor-at-large Paul Kelly said there was a \u201csense of hopelessness\u201d about the war in Syria.\u201cThe outlook, as far as I can see, is pretty bleak at the moment,\u201d Mr Kelly said.\u201cThere have been efforts at negotiations. They haven\u2019t been successful.\u201cThe degree of destruction and damage to human life is incomprehensible.\u201dMr Kelly said the war \u201cdefied our sense of humanity (and) political imagination\u201d.\u201cThe idea 10 years ago this would have happened to Syria would have been beyond any sort of human understanding,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd the parties, the parties are locked in this conflict and they seem to be willing at this stage to continue the conflict for their own particular objectives.\u201dSHOULD AUSTRALIA INCREASE FOREIGN AID TO SYRIA?The panel also discussed whether or not countries including Australia were taking serious steps to end the conflict and increase foreign aid.The talk soon moved to who funded terrorists in Syria and whether or not Australia should cut supplies to the country.Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the major players were not just the Assad regime and Islamic State.\u201cThe Russians are heavily involved and with a veto at the UN Security Council, that has put a block on united action through the UN,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\u201cIran is a Shiite country.\u201cAnd Assad is part of a minority group \u2014 only 13 per cent of Syria \u2014 but a Shiite sect. So Iran is heavily involved providing support through Hezbollah to the Syrian regime.\u201dThe panel heard Saudis and other Gulf Arab states have also been involved in \u201cfunding the other side\u201d.\u201cIt plays to a much bigger schism in the Islamic world between the Sunni and the Shiite sects,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\u201cAnd the US, famously Obama said, there is a red line here.\u201cIf they use chemical weapons, we\u2019ll take action.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of evidence to suggest that red line was crossed but no subsequent action was taken.\u201dThe final word went to Ms Thorning Schmidt who said it was important not to let other countries with people suffering be forgotten.\u201cLet\u2019s not forget we have about 14 million right now who are in a serious situation, many in risk of famine in the horn of Africa,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s a toxic mix between war and drought, climate change, poverty, everything\u2019s happened there.

But what happened when cameras left the town of walking \u201cskeletons\u201d?In the Syrian town of Madaya, children and villagers were denied food for so long they resembled skeletons.IT\u2019S the town that made global headlines after it was revealed that, after eating all the dogs and cats, residents were so hungry they had turned to boiling grass to stay alive.Madaya, in Syria, became known as a place of living \u201cskeletons\u201d, where pregnant women were too weak to give birth and children were starved to death as a deliberate tactic of war by Syrian despot Bashar al-Assad.Now, one of only two \u201cdoctors\u201d who stayed behind has spoken about the true horror that befell Madaya once the world\u2019s media lost interest.As thousands of people finally begin to evacuate it and other besieged towns in Syria, Dr Mohammad Darwish says the world knew about what was happening in Madaya two years ago, and did nothing to stop it.In an interview with the ABC\u2019s Sophie McNeil, Dr Darwish \u2014 a dental student before the outbreak of civil war \u2014 said people inside Madaya were trapped in a living nightmare.\u201cNo matter what words I use, I still can\u2019t tell you enough about what we endured in this town,\u201d Dr Darwish said.\u201cDuring the days of the starvation, almost no people were walking on the streets, people had no energy to walk or to stand up.\u201d\u2018BAGS OF MILK FOR $100\u2019Residents at the time reported being without food for so long, they had \u201cforgotten what bread tastes like\u201d, and the ability to smuggle in supplies became so rare and risky that a bag of milk was fetching $100, or a kilo of rice $150. Malnourished mothers lost the ability to breastfeed and people had taken to boiling weeds and grass for \u201csoup.\u201d\u201cYoung people, women and children have turned into skeletons from hunger. The town needs everything,\u201d said Moaz al-Qalamuni, a journalist in Madaya said in January last year as a brutal winter and no energy for heating threatened to freeze many to death.While the Syrian Government did allow some supplies into the rebel-held town, dozens of people died of starvation as they waited for aid.Dr Darwish said more than 80 people perished from lack of food and diseases that could have been cured with proper medical treatment, while others were killed by landmines that had been ringed around the town so that no one could leave.He said the West, along with the UN Security Council and the other UN bodies, hadn\u2019t done enough to help despite knowing how dire the situation had become.\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, they let us down,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecifically us the people of Madaya and the Syrian people in general.\u201cThe world watched us die and be massacred and they did nothing.\u201dIn a Q&A on Syria:direct in August last year, the 26-year-old revealed that he, another dentist and a vet were left to treat more than 40,000 of Madaya\u2019s citizens, despite being woefully underequipped.In some circumstances, the trio couldn\u2019t offer any treatment at all.\u201cIf a situation requires major surgery, there\u2019s nothing that we can do,\u201d he said.\u201cOne time, there were three children who were injured by a landmine. They were rushed to the hospital, but we just stood there staring. The children died before our very eyes that day.\u201dDr Darwish said it was heartbreaking to watch children and babies die simply because there wasn\u2019t the equipment, training or knowledge to save them.Sometimes the best they could do was talk to doctors overseas via messaging app whatsapp for advice on what to do.WOMEN TOO WEAK TO GIVE BIRTHThe rebel-held town of Madaya has been cut off from the world for almost two years.Surrounded by Syrian Government forces and their allies, those in the town have little chance of getting out, and even less hope of getting food and supplies in.Last year the UN revealed there were credible reports of people dying of starvation in Madaya.Children soon became malnourished and lived mainly off rice, with other food difficult to attain, the BBC reported.Mothers were miscarrying and some were so weak they were unable to give birth.Landmines laid around the town meant escape was almost impossible especially for those who were chronically ill, the young and elderly.Last week residents in Madaya and surrounds were offered a glimmer of hope as hundreds of terrorised Syrians were evacuated from besieged towns under a a deal brokered by regime ally Iran and Qatar, a longtime supporter of Syrian rebel groups.However, many became stuck on Thursday at a rebel-held transit point where dozens of their fellow townspeople were killed in a weekend bombing.About 3000 evacuees left their homes in the government-controlled towns of Fuaa and Kafraya at dawn on Wednesday as part of a deal under which residents and fighters are also to be evacuated from several rebel areas surrounded by government forces.Shiite-dominated Iran has repeatedly raised concerns for the mainly Shiite residents of Fuaa and Kafraya, who are besieged by Sunni rebels and Islamists who control the surrounding Idlib province.Those leaving rebel-held areas will head to Idlib province, which is held by an opposition alliance.Under the agreement, residents and rebel fighters are being evacuated from the towns of Madaya, Zabadani, and other nearby opposition-held areas close to Damascus.A second set of evacuations which will see up to 30,000 people transferred from their homes, will take place in June.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime has presented evacuation deals as the best way to end Syria\u2019s war, which has killed more than 320,000 people and forced more than half the population from their homes.The opposition says the evacuations amount to forced relocation after years of bombardment and siege.Syria\u2019s opposition and Western leaders have accused Assad\u2019s regime of a wide range of abuses during the conflict, including a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun earlier this month that killed at least 87 people.debra.killalea@news.com.auAt least 43 people were killed and many others injured on April 15 when a blast struck a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from besieged pro-regime towns in Idlib province to an opposition-held area in west Aleppo. The blast happened at a location where an exchange between pro-regime and rebel forces was due to take place. Evacuations resumed later on April 15, under an agreement known as the Four Towns Deal. The agreement allowed rebel fighters and their families to leave the besieged rebel-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani in Damascus province and pro-regime fighters and their families to leave the besieged pro-regime towns of Kefraya and al-Foua in Idlib province, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The mood in the car was sombre. Zenobia's enthusiasm for air travel was buried under her apprehension about leaving behind her mother, my diplomat wife Hanlie, who would pack up the house and tie up loose ends. She understood these were not usual times. The route to the airport was, thankfully, clear of trouble and the armed soldiers and security intelligence officers at the five checkpoints we passed were polite and relaxed. But a couple of kilometres to the north, towards the Old City, columns of smoke could be seen rising as Government forces bombarded the Tadamon and Jobar districts, trying to flush out rebels. Since Syria's version of the Arab uprising against decaying authoritarian regimes broke out in March last year, security across the country had been steadily eroding. In December, big car bombs hit two security compounds in Kafer Suseh, central Damascus, close to where I was helping with some writing and editing for Syria Today magazine. Forty-four people were killed and 166 injured. Spasmodic violence continued in the following months, making life steadily more dangerous. Then, in July, armed rebels took over some districts in the city. Fighting and shelling became a daily event and the peril ever-present. It was no longer worth the risk to remain in the city. In our three-and-a-half years in Syria, we saw the country not only from street level but also from the edges of elite circles - our daughter was at school with the son of President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma and they attended school functions like any well-to-do couple. And for two years I was able to travel extensively, from the black-stoned Roman remains in Bosra in the south, to the crumbling 5000-year-old Mesopotamian ruins at Mari on the Euphrates. I visited the Roman ruin at Palmyra, the 3700-year-old site of Ugarit and the luminescent St Simeon Cathedral ruin north of Aleppo near the Turkish border. On the other hand we knew what it was like to be shadowed by the security forces and to be surrounded by angry mobs. Many of our Syrian friends told stories of rampant bribery, cronyism, arbitrary arrest and lengthy imprisonment without trial. Yet when the Arab Spring broke out last year, Syria seemed the least likely place that would succumb. Though it was still a totalitarian state, some reform had been allowed and Bashar and Asma seemed to be popular, at least among the middle classes. All that began to change in March last year when security forces overstepped the mark by torturing a group of children caught writing anti-government graffiti. The cracks swiftly appeared in the brittle structure of the state, exposing deep divisions in the country along regional, religious, ethnic and class lines. These divisions had been hidden by a ruthless Soviet-style police state, in which all organs of government were controlled by the presidency and the security apparatus. The citizen effectively had no rights and the government no requirement for accountability. About 15 branches of the 70,000 strong security apparatus, supported by networks of informers, ensured that all political space was shut down and the media tightly controlled. Any active opposition figures were imprisoned or exiled. The secret police, the Mukhabarat, were everywhere. Young men in black leather jackets and jeans with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders frequently reminded me that I could not take photos near the multitude of security and military compounds around Damascus. Whenever I travelled out of the city, they followed in the security services' standard issue beat-up Peugeot 404s. There was no hiding the poverty in the poorer towns and the slums encircling Damascus and Aleppo. In 2010, per capita GDP was only US$5200 ($6228) and 34 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line. Unemployment was estimated at over 20 per cent, and was especially high for the young. Cronyism, corruption and nepotism were rampant throughout government. A friend of mine returned to Syria in 2009, after living outside of the country for several years. To clear her possessions from customs at the port in Lattakia, she was required to pay a bribe of US$1000. The regime controlled all government employment. Merit was not part of the process. It was \"wasta\", or patronage, that counted. Citizens were frequently arrested and detained without charge. A friend spent many years in Assad jails without charge for suspected association with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, membership of which carries the death penalty. The Assad family occupied the very top of the Syrian power pyramid, and controlled the security apparatus including the police, the military, and the Mukhabarat. Below them were layers of mostly fellow Alawite senior functionaries, supported by Christians and Sunnis who knew their only way to get ahead was to ally with the regime. The Government was essentially a huge family mafia. The Alawites, a Shia sect, make up 10 per cent of Syria's population, Christians 10 per cent, Sunnis 70 per cent, Druze two per cent, Kurds 7 per cent and others 1 per cent. On the surface the sectarian make-up of the country had little impact on daily life. Government censors would not allow reference to any sectarian group. Syria was a secular Arab nationalist state with social and religious freedom: there were no restrictions on dress and alcohol was discreetly available. But the regime ruled by fear. Its propaganda machine instilled in the population a fear of Muslim extremism, of Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, Wahabis and Al Qaeda. The aim was to ensure the support of Alawites, Christians, and Druze, and the more liberal Sunnis. In the first couple of years we were there, Syria seemed to be emerging from a long period of isolation. Relations with Turkey had improved dramatically, with free trade and visa-free agreements. The economy was also growing, if slowly at 3.4 per cent, with tourism making up for declining oil and gas revenues. Since 2005, Assad had moved, if haltingly, to reform the economy on a market-social model. Foreign investment, particularly in the banking sector, was encouraged. Despite the obvious poverty, in Damascus and Aleppo wealth was evident on the streets with luxury cars and European boutiques evidence of a growing elite. Against this background, when colleagues asked me in February 2011 - after the Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya uprisings - whether Syria might be next, I said \"very unlikely\". At that time Assad was 45 years old and his wife Asma 35. They were a popular couple. Some economic reforms had brought change, and although Assad's talk of political reform had produced no results, there was the hope that the regime would read the signs in the region and get ahead of the reform game. Importantly, unlike Tunisia and the other dictatorships in the region, the Syrian leadership was not allied to the West. Syria stood, with Iran and the Lebanese Shia militia cum political party Hizbullah, against the so-called \"Zionist-American project\" in the Middle East, a policy popular on the Arab street. Well, I was wrong. My perspective was perhaps coloured by personal experience. Zenobia spent a year in the same class as Karim al-Assad, the president's son. When I attended parent-teacher meetings, Asma, the \"first lady\", was present. Her contributions were always low-key, but it was clear she was a liberal, modern, intelligent and eloquent woman. At the end-of-year school concert Bashar and Asma came along in their jeans and leather jackets, and mingled freely with the children. This outgoing and relaxed style had endeared this couple to the country's moneyed elite and the rising middle class, if not the country at large. The regime's true colours were shown when 15 children wrote anti-government graffiti on a wall in the southern city of Dera'a in March last year. The security forces arrested them, took them to Damascus, beat and tortured them, including pulling out some fingernails. This outraged their extended families and fellow citizens who took to the streets in protest where security forces fired on the unarmed crowd, killing several people. The regime's strategy was immediately revealed - it would intimidate and bludgeon all opposition into submission using deadly force if necessary. But demonstrations spread across the country. Syria's time had come. The protests, and the regime's response, shocked everyone. After 40 years of fear, suppression, censorship and intimidation, a self-liberation took hold as citizens massed in the streets, initially shouting for democratic reforms, dignity, an end to corruption and a reigning-in of the security services. As protest spread and the crackdown intensified, the demands escalated into calls for an end to the Assad regime. The fear barrier had been broken. In April last year we saw for ourselves how the divisions in Syrian society were opening up when we travelled to Aleppo, stopping on the way to view the \"lost cities\", a cluster of AD400 Byzantine towns. At the town of Murat Al-Numan we noticed a large group of young men standing around with Syrian flag; a kilometre away was another group of 200 or 300 marching toward the town. A young Syrian pulled up and shouted in English that we must turn around, \"there was trouble\". We did so. But by then the group in town had swelled. Armed with sticks and clubs they were marching towards the other group, shouting pro-government slogans. We were caught in the middle. To our relief the angry mob let us pass through their ranks without incident. The two groups embodied the sharp divisions that were opening up in Syrian society.. The regime's propaganda response was that the violence emanated from \"armed terrorist groups\", including criminals and religious extremists, supported by foreigners. The regime staged televised \"confessions\" of young men with their weapons to validate the story, while armed thugs were recruited by the regime into the mostly Alawite \"Shabbiha\" gangs to do the more unsavoury intimidation work. The torture of protesters, mostly young, became routine. A friend of mine had one of his workers arrested. They beat and humiliated him for 10 days, then left him alone for 20 days for his wounds to heal, then released him to his family. Such stories are very common. In some cases the regime would return a mutilated corpse. Assad belatedly announced some modest political reforms as protests increased. The emergency law, invoked following the 1963 Baathist coup, was lifted. A new media law was passed. A referendum on a new constitution was held on February 26, 2012. Parliamentary elections were held on May 7, and a new government formed on June 23. However these \"reforms\" were a sham and included no input from the opposition, who boycotted the elections. The secular veneer of Syrian society began to lift as the violence intensified. The protesters and victims of state violence were overwhelmingly Sunni. They were being killed and tortured by a security apparatus which was predominantly Shia Alawite. The UN Human Rights Council appointed an independent commission on Syria which released a report last month confirming that government forces had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, torture, sexual violence, looting and destruction of property. The report also found that government forces and \"Shabbiha\" had massacred 108 civilians in Houla, a massacre the regime had blamed on \"armed terrorist groups\". The commission found opposition fighters had also committed war crimes, including murder, extrajudicial execution and torture. During the first six months of the uprising, the regime was able to mount some huge pro-government demonstrations, particularly in Damascus. These were held on weekdays so government workers and schoolchildren could be marshalled to attend. But communities of Alawis and Christians and others also willingly attended. These rallies stopped as the regime became increasingly aware its support base was shrinking. It is very difficult to assess support for the regime, but there is little doubt that it is still considerable. A Christian friend of mine remains implacably in support of Assad, but only because he fears the rule of the majority Sunnis, a rule he believes would be extremist and anti-Christian. The sharp domestic divide is mirrored at regional and international levels. Iran has been closely allied to Syria since the Assads backed them in their 1980-1988 war against Iraq. Iran is supplying both weapons and technical assistance to the Assad regime. Syria has also facilitated the supply of Iranian arms to Hizbullah, which is now the leading faction in the Lebanese government. The US-British invasion of Iraq facilitated the rise of the majority Shia to power there, and as a result Iraq too supports the Assad regime. On the other side of the regional divide Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have all called for an orderly transition and for Assad to step down. It is widely believed that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are supplying arms to anti-government rebels. The Arab League sent monitors to Syria in December last year to help negotiate a ceasefire, but they were withdrawn three months later, having been ignored by both sides. The international community is also divided. Russia and China have blocked three UN Security Council resolutions to put pressure on Assad to implement a ceasefire and engage the opposition in dialogue. Though the Security Council did agree to a joint Arab League-UN peace initiative under former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, the mission was without teeth and it failed. Annan left his post last month and the 300 strong UN Supervisory Mission in Syria, which included a small New Zealand element, was withdrawn. Lakhdar Ebrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, replaced Annan three weeks ago. He admitted that his mission is \"almost impossible\", and most analysts doubt he can conjure up the peaceful solution which eluded Annan. Too much blood has been spilled. Coinciding with Ebrahimi's appointment, Mohammad Mursi, Egypt's president, convened a regional \"Quartet\" comprising Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Quartet seems as divided as the Security Council and without a change in Iran's stance is unlikely to be in a position to pressure the Assad regime or the rebels to lay down arms and begin a dialogue. After 18 months, the Syrian uprising has claimed more than 20,000 lives according to a conservative UN estimate. More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, 2.5 million require humanitarian assistance, and more than 230,000 have fled and are registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Syrian opposition groups say 26,000 people have been detained. From the outset, Assad's regime has unswervingly followed the security solution, and government forces have resorted to artillery, tank, and more recently air bombardments including on residential areas. The regime is morphing into an Alawite militia prepared to fight it out to the bitter end, regardless of the cost to the country. Negotiation and compromise are not part of the state's lexicon. And the ranks of anti-government rebels have been growing steadily as more and more Syrians take up arms to avenge the violence against their families, villages and towns. The boldness of their attacks on government targets has increased, and regime \"insiders\" are helping them. Our lives over the past few months had become increasingly constrained by security considerations. There were several small roadside bombs targeting military vehicles exploding just a few kilometres from the house. All unnecessary travel was curtailed. However the wider dangers of this war came home to us personally in July this year when the opposition Free Syrian Army assassinated four top security officials, including Assad's brother-in-law, at a meeting in a military compound a few hundred metres from the presidential residence. In response Assad forces dramatically intensified their artillery bombardment of several districts of Damascus making life unpredictable and dangerous, and provoking an exodus of tens of thousands from Damascus across the border into Lebanon. We joined that search for safety because there were clear risks of a dramatic escalation of the conflict. We spent 10 days in Beirut waiting for a break in the fighting so we could return and pack our things. There is a high risk that the conflict will become an increasingly sectarian proxy war with, on the Assad regime's side, Shia Iran, Iraq, and Hizbullah, backed by Russia and China; and supporting the opposition, Sunni Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey backed by the US, Britain and France. This is a civil war which could last years and take countless lives. On the day we left, Zenobia and I reached the airport in time to catch one of the last Etihad flights out before the airline stopped its Damascus service. As the aircraft swung south over the parched August desert towards Abu Dhabi, my thoughts turned to the wonderful Syrians who had proudly shared their beautiful, ancient and romantic Damascus with us for three and a half years. Though many Syrian friends who had the means had already left the country, and others had escaped on study grants overseas, I was leaving most behind to face a violent and uncertain future. It seems the price Syrians will pay to achieve their freedom from a corrupt, brutal and inept dictatorship will far outweigh that paid by their awakened Arab counterparts in the region.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine, according to news.com.au. But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career. Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade. When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded. But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants. The al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father's death. According to the Lowy Institute's Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change. \"He had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\" Dr Shanahan said. But that didn't happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government. \"You can't open up free speech in a closed political system,\" he said. Asma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 - just months before he became president. From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial - the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni. As Syria's First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women's rights and education. The couple have three children. Assad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists. But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent. One of Assad's first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reforms. But the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving. Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands. A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed. The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad's Ba'ath Party holding effective power. The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied. Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013. Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria. The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province. The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate. In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad's forces. By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war. Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra. And the messy, long and complicated war isn't just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere. Quite a lot actually. By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo. By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back. More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front. The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces. Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask. Domestically he's generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments. Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him. Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response. Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries. But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war. Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey. But millions of others have suffered. Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.

However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story. \"The US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don't see this situation changing anytime soon,\" he said."}{"head": " Six basic questions about the war in Syria  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " The Syrian war has been a slowly unfolding catastrophe, one that has embroiled nearly the whole world.

In March 2011, peaceful protests broke out around the country as part of the Arab Spring uprisings. Organizers called on Syrian President Bashar Assad to make democratic reforms, but his government responded with violence. In response, some of the protesters teamed up with military defectors to form the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group that wanted to overthrow the government. By 2012, this armed struggle had devolved into a full-blown civil war. Russia has long supported Assad's government. According to one scholar, Russia helped build the modern Syrian military, and Assad is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strongest allies in the Middle East. Russia has often blocked meaningful international action on Syria by vetoing proposals at the U.N. Security Council, and Moscow changed the course of the war in Assad's favor with a military intervention in 2015. The United States has been reluctant to become too entangled in Syria, but it has acted for two main reasons. First, the Islamic State began developing a foothold in the country in 2013. The next year, the United States launched airstrikes against the militant group. It eventually sent ground troops into the fight, and about 2,000 U.S. forces are now deployed there. Second, the United States has acted to punish the Assad government for using chemical weapons such as sarin and chlorine gas on Syrian civilians. In 2012, President Barack Obama called the use of chemical weapons a \"red line\" that would prompt military intervention. The following year, a sarin gas attack in Eastern Ghouta killed about 1,400 people, according to the U.S. government's assessment. Obama pushed for a strike but couldn't get congressional approval. Instead, he came up with a diplomatic solution. The U.N. Security Council ordered Assad to destroy his chemical weapons stockpile and sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits countries from producing, stockpiling or using chemical weapons. There have been several reports of chemical weapons attacks since then. One particularly bad strike took place April 4, 2017. Nearly 100 people were killed in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun in an apparent sarin attack. It garnered worldwide headlines and the attention of President Trump, who expressed horror at the images of \"innocent children, innocent babies\" poisoned by a nerve agent. Just a few days after that attack, Trump authorized a cruise-missile strike on a Syrian air base. It was the first direct U.S. strike on the Syrian regime in the war. One of Assad's key allies is Iran. Iran needs Syria to move its weapons and proxy militias across the Middle East. So when Assad seemed threatened, Iran stepped in to support him. So did Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militia that is a close ally of Tehran. That upset Iran's rivals in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. So they began sending arms and money to anti-Assad rebels, including extremist militias. Israel's begun attacking Assad bases with airstrikes. That means that today, there are many wars being fought inside Syria. The Syrian government is still at war with the rebels. Israel is at war with Iranian-backed forces. And the United States is trying to kill off the Islamic State. Horrible. Syrian families often don't have basic necessities, like food, shelter and medical care. Children can't go to school. The war is being fought in towns and on the streets. Since the start of the war, more than 465,000 Syrians have been killed, 1 million more have been injured, and 12 million - more than half the country's population - have been forced to flee their homes. More than 5.5 million have moved abroad and registered as refugees."}{"head": " The Syria strikes: What do they achieve and what's next?

The US President has frequently disputed that his election opponent won more votes than he did and his predecessor drew a bigger inauguration crowd. He has taken time out from the biggest job on the planet to feud on Twitter with Arnold Schwarzenegger over ratings for The Apprentice. During a speech to Congress, his idea of offering comfort to a dead Navy Seal's widow after she received a standing ovation was to say her husband was \"very happy, because I think he just broke a record\". So, weeks of job approval ratings, chronically low for a new US president, must have been hard to stomach. Gallup figures showing Trump at 37 and 38 per cent approval have been widely shared among politicos on the President's social media of choice, Twitter. And polls showed sliding support among groups of voters for Trump and his policies. When combined with daily doses of bad news about the Russia investigation, stalled healthcare reform, legal blocks to immigration moves, insider leaking and Trump Administration chaos, it was clear change was required. Unpopularity makes it harder for a president to push through programmes and easier for opponents to obstruct. The story of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, illustrated in ever-widening web lines in graphics, has become the President's own email server saga millstone. What could shift it? On Friday, as US cruise missiles punched holes in hangars on the Syria regime's Shayrat base, a widely-shared Trump tweet from October 9, 2012 hinted at a possible parallel playing out: \"Now that Obama's poll numbers are in tailspin - watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.\" Trump's cruise missile strikes days after an apparent chemical weapons attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun need to be seen in the context of his domestic political woes and his background on the Syrian civil war. Eleven weeks into his presidency, Trump is attempting a reset, trying to boost his popularity and control the agenda. He wants to change the conversation from the Russia probe and the allegation he is President Vladimir Putin's puppet. The strikes are part of it, so is generally creating a perception of 'winning', being decisive, being taken more seriously, presenting messages more competently and having the right advisers. So far, in the past few days, it is working. REACTION TO THE RETALIATION Although the speed of the retaliation was a surprise, the action wasn't to pundits who have seen it all before from previous leaders. Harvard professor Stephen Walt tweeted on Thursday: \"I don't know what Trump will do re Syria. But I'm betting it will be some loud, well-publicised, and strategically meaningless airstrikes.\" With the missile strikes, Trump has had the best couple of days of his presidency. On the face of it, he has taken unusually quick, decisive action on an issue that gives him a chance to show empathy and people generally agree on. The taboo on chemcal weapons is worth upholding, right? Both the Washington establishment and mainstream US media have largely been sympathetic. A poll boost is sure to follow. Foreign leaders have expressed support. His former opponent Hillary Clinton in an interview on Friday called for strikes against Syrian airfields. The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \"the era of American passivity is over\". Democrat leader in the House Nancy Pelosi called Trump's strikes a \"proportional response\". Former Obama Administration ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, called them \"correct and well executed\". The New York Times and Guardian ran story-behind-the-story articles which bolstered Trump's assertion that he was spurred into action by footage of Syria's suffering people and depicted him as a man of action. The New York Times: \"Trump was already shaken by photos his staff had shown him of children dying ... so the President did not need a lot of convincing ... aides say the images from Syria - especially those showing the suffering of small children and babies - weigh on him ... The first public evidence of the President's concern about the chemical attack comes ... Trump says his horror at the images of 'innocent children, innocent babies' choked by poison gas in the attack has led him to reassess his approach to Syria.\" The Guardian: \"The images had a profound effect on the US President ... 'I will tell you that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me - big impact,' Trump told reporters ... Trump had criticised Obama for vacillation and weakness. Would he act differently? Within 24 hours Trump's flexibility had translated into direct action ... After weeks in which his Administration had seemed consumed by leaks, in fighting, drift and ineptitude, Trump was moving at speed.\" CNN ran a report with the extremely Trump-friendly headline: \"These are the images that moved President Trump to act in Syria\". Daily Beast and CNN commentator Matt Lewis tweeted: \"Trump can punish Assad, deter future use of chemical weapons, send a message to the world, & still avoid the mess of regime change.\" Presenter with Britain's Channel 4 Matt Frei tweeted: \"With Syria strikes @realDonaldTrump showed 1he can act decisively 2not Russia's puppet 3not Obama 4has humanitarian reflex5 unpredictable.\" As MSNBC host Chris Hayes noted: \"Tonight Trump is getting praise from the very same Establishment he ran against and whose approval he desperately seeks.\" The circumstances surrounding the President's crisis point were significant.Trump dealt with the Syria issue while hosting the Chinese President Xi Jinping. He received a major Congressional victory with the Senate confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. And various reports emerged of a staff shake-up, with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Stephen Bannon said to be in trouble. The staffing reports had Trump ordering his aides to sort it out. The message being, man in charge is putting that infighting behind him. TRUMP'S BIG U-TURN ON SYRIA According to the Daily Beast, there had been nine previous suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria this year, with toxic chlorine gas, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Trump Administration had shown no previous desire to take retalitory action. And what about deaths caused by conventional weapons? Remember the agonising fall of Aleppo late last year? Trump's team has been trying hard to get a ban on Syrian refugees - fleeing their brutal dictator - from entering the US. Before he became president, Trump said numerous times in 2013 and 2014 that the US should not bomb Syria. In 2013 former President Barack Obama declared chemical weapon use a red line and then backed down from taking military action in the face of popular and Congressional opposition. In August 2013, chemical weapons were used against people in Ghouta, killing about 1300. Trump tweeted: \"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long-term conflict?\" And: \"President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your 'powder' for another (and more important) day!\" Acting on the latest atrocity - thought to involve sarin gas - gave Trump a chance to shape up in comparison to Obama. Yesterday, press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a photo of Trump and team at a briefing in what was clearly meant to mirror the famous picture of Obama and officials during the Osama bin Laden raid. Washington Post blogger Paul Waldman tweeted: \"In these foreign policy crises, almost impossible to overestimate the role Trump's desire 2B tougher than Obama will play in his decisions\". Trump called it a \"targeted\" strike \"on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread of chemical weapons\". Syria denies using nerve gas. Trump's speech sounded very much like something George W. Bush could have delivered. \"My fellow Americans\", \"no child of God\", \"end the slaughter\", \"we pray for God's wisdom\", \"America stands for justice\". The only Trumpian note in it was \"beautiful babies\". Trump's sudden concern for Syrians is problematic whether taken at face value or not. Firstly, it is a convenient phenomenon that we can only take his word for. Secondly, it only seems to apply to Syrians killed by chemical weapons. Thirdly, it goes against his background statements and actions towards Syrian refugees. Fourthly, is it a good thing that the President can suddenly change course based on an emotional, gut reaction? Also, as Micah Zenko of the Council of Foreign Relations tweeted: \"That Trump was moved by graphic images to OK the attack won't be lost on all threatened groups seeking US intervention on their behalf.\" WHAT DID THE STRIKES ACHIEVE? For many people hoping for progress in ending the Syrian civil war, none of that will matter. The war is a gaping wound in the world which has destabilised the region and wider Europe. It is a complex conflict seemingly without end that has left people for years looking on feeling frustrated and helpless, or angry at the displaced millions. In reactions to the US strikes, a lot of people commenting on media and social media seemed to be uploading their own emotional projections about the war onto Trump's actions. Some people saw it as appropriate, limited, punishment for the Khan Sheikhoun attack. There was relief from Syrians that the Assad regime had finally taken a hit from the US. Perhaps more would follow. Long-time Syria watchers believed it was strategically good that Trump had demonstrated that military force was on the table. Obama's unwillingness to battle Bashar al-Assad as well as Isis had been seen as prolonging the war. Perhaps this has opened the door to intervention against the regime after the quarantined approach. Some saw Trump as refilling the Rubicon to deter future use of chemical weapons.Other people focused on whether the strikes were legal, or whether they sent a wider warning to North Korea and China, or whether the US was just repeating ineffective history. Some right-wing supporters of Trump were disappointed that he was not the isolationist they had believed in. It was quickly clear that the strikes were limited in scope and largely symbolic: A mini shock and awe. By Friday night NZT Reuters and AFP were reporting that planes were already using the base to take off on bombing raids in the countryside. By yesterday Khan Sheikhoun was being bombed again. Reports quickly surfaced on Friday from the BBC and ABC that Russians and Syrians were evacuated from the airbase before the strike. The Pentagon confirmed that Russia was notified in advance. Al Jazeera America producer Tony Karon tweeted: \"For anyone who thinks this is start of a war to topple Assad, note the care taken to minimise risk to his forces at target site\". Moscow has promised to strengthen Syria's anti-aircraft defences. It is also suspending a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their planes in Syria. Today Russia sent a warship to boost its battlegroup off the Syrian coast. Considering how both Trump and Putin would benefit from more perceived independence from each other, just how coordinated were the strikes? It is impossible to know just yet. Eurasia Group political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted: \"Assad gas attack vigorously denied by Kremlin & makes Putin looks weak v Assad (Iran matters..). US-Russia heading for trouble\". Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland smells a scam. \"How convenient that Trump, under fire for being Vladimir Putin's poodle, now stands up to him in Syria. How neatly this blows away all those allegations of secret links and election hacking. Yes, there have been ample statements of condemnation from Moscow, but those don't cost either side anything. The US appears to have given Russia sufficient warning to ensure their men weren't hit, and Russia used none of its ample capacity to hit back. It all worked out very nicely.\" HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO THEY CARRY? There has been a lot of debate on how much weight these strikes carry. If it is too obviously organised military theatre then can it really enforce a warning to the Syrian regime? Is Trump almost guaranteed to have to go further at some stage? And should Trump suddenly be seen as a 'strong' leader, having dropped 59 cruise missiles worth US$59 million, after decades of war. Zenko tweeted: \"US dropped 26,172 bombs in 2016. How does 59 more suddenly demonstrate US 'resolve,' 'credibility,' + 'leadership?'\" New York Times journalist Max Fisher wrote in a series of tweets: \"Still confused by argument that the US established anti-CW deterrence by demonstrating it will retaliate with negligibly damaging strikes. If this was executed competently and Russia given warnings, then strikes appear largely symbolic. Little impact on regime or its calculus. How exactly did these US strikes establish deterrence? Is this 'punishment' sufficient to change anything?\" Josh Barro of Business Insider asked: \"If you openly signal that the attack was symbolic, doesn't that undermine the symbolism?\" Naval War College professor Tom Nichols tweeted: \"This looks like a pinprick. It pops the balloon of thinking Syria is untouchable, but whether it deters anything is less clear.\" Former US Treasury terror finance analyst Jonathan Schanzer tweeted: \"FWIW, I think a limited, proportional response is a good first move. Doesn't solve Syria, but lets Assad/Iran know we are watching.\" Clifford May of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies tweeted: \"Also let's Russia know we're back in the game. N Korea, too, can no longer bank on US inaction, 'soft power' and talking as only responses.\" WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? For many experts the 'what's next' question is key. University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami tweeted: \"Within days, Trump's strike will look more and more ineffective, forcing a decision: escalate or live with perception of failure.\" Writer Max Boot tweeted: \"Now what? Is message that US will tolerate Assad as long as he doesn't use CW? Or is this prelude to larger strategy in Syria? If so what?\" Former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said that \"Trump biggest worry now; what if Assad defies him and uses chemical weapons again?\" Head of Foreign Policy Group, David Rothkopf, tweeted: \"Problem re: Trump & mil action is - he's impulsive and not strategic. Taking such action absent clear policies is where biggest risks arise. The 'what's next' component of Syria strike will reveal much about effectiveness & thinking of Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster, Pompeo team.\" Zenko said a 'rosy scenario' could see Assad deterred without the US being drawn further into the civil war. But he said \"I looked at 36 cases of limited US strikes: They achieve military goals 1/2 the time; political goals less than 10%.\" A Middle East veteran writer, Sam Dagher, tweeted: \"Without plan to remove Assad from power US strikes strengthen him as leader confronting Trump aggression.\" The editor of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, compared the President with his predecessor: \"Obama was known for an overly cerebral commitment to the notion of strategic patience. Trump seems more committed to a policy of glandular, non-strategic impatience. Obama may have been paralysed by a phobic reaction to the threat posed by the slippery slope. Donald Trump now finds himself dancing at the edge of the slippery slope his predecessor so assiduously avoided.\""}{"head": "The Syrian \u2018hell on earth\u2019 is a tangle of power plays unlikely to end soon", "classes": ["intro", "description"], "content": "THE war in Syria has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced millions, but there is a reason why the fighting won\u2019t end soon.A Russian call for a five-hour truce has failed to halt one of the most devastating campaigns of the Syrian war.\n\nResidents say government warplanes resumed striking the eastern Ghouta region after a brief lull.ONCE again, unfortunate civilians are trapped in the \u201chell on earth\u201d that the Syrian civil war has become. This time it is the turn of the 400,000 residents of Eastern Ghouta, 10km east of the capital Damascus. Latest reports put civilian casualties at 520 and thousands wounded under the heavy assault launched by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ground forces supported by Russian air strikes.It seems conditions in Syria are getting worse, and there is no end to the conflict.The end to any violent conflict comes when either the warring sides realise the devastation they cause and make peace; outside intervention sways the warring parties to end the conflict; or there are clear winners delivering a crushing defeat to their enemies.None of the warring factions seem to care about the devastation of the seven-year civil war. Almost the entire country is rubble \u2014 more than 400,000 people have died, there are 5 million Syrian refugees and more than 6 million displaced. Unfortunately, the peace option seems highly unlikely.There had been international intervention through peace initiatives since 2013, when the then US Secretary of State, John Kerry, lamented that Syria \u201cheads closer to an abyss, if not over the abyss and into chaos\u201d. It was a chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta that prompted the United Nations to pass a resolution in 2013 demanding the destruction of chemical stockpiles and giving impetus to peace talks in Geneva. All efforts to make progress on these talks were continually stalled. The parties failed to meet even as late as 2017, painfully expediting Mr Kerry\u2019s apocalyptic prediction.The Geneva talks were paralleled by a Russian-led peace initiative in Kazakhstan and later in Sochi. These talks could not have been expected to succeed, given that Russia\u2019s unconditional and active support of the Assad regime hampered any attempt at negotiating a peace deal.Apart from the vested interests and insincerity, the biggest stumbling block has been disagreement over who to include in the peace process.The US does not want Mr Assad or Iran involved; Turkey does not want the Kurdish People\u2019s Defence Unit (YPG); and Russia does not want any of the jihadist rebel groups.The sheer number of rebel groups is another issue. In the relatively small area of Eastern Ghouta alone, there are three rebel groups, which often bicker with one another.Since the conflict began in 2011, nearly 200 separate rebel groups have sporadically emerged. Although most of these later merged into larger entities, there are still too many groups. Their inclusion in any peace process has been problematic, because it is unclear who actually represents the Syrian opposition, not to mention the groups\u2019 refusal to sit at the same table.Then there is the thorny issue of ideological and religious differences. Shiite Syrians and a segment of secular Sunni Muslims support the Assad regime, whereas the largest chunk of the rebel groups are Salafi jihadists. The exceptions are the Kurdish YPG and the largely weakened Free Syrian Army.All along, Mr Assad\u2019s regime has been claiming it is fighting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other Salafi jihadist groups to keep Syria a modern secular state. Mr Putin is pushing Mr Assad to wipe out these groups, spurred by the deep fear they could mobilise radical Muslim groups within Russia\u2019s borders.The US and Europe are in the cognitive dissonance of wanting neither Mr Assad nor jihadist groups to gain control in Syria. They don\u2019t want Mr Assad, but they like his argument of protecting a modern secular Syria. The unspoken preference is for Mr Assad over any Jihadi rebel group.So, the lack of an effective peace intervention and the impossibility of parties sitting down to negotiate, leaves only the option of fighting it out until clear victors emerge.This leaves the Assad regime with a free run to assert itself as the only feasible and legitimate government in Syria, a possibility that may indeed eventuate.This is the strategic line the Assad regime has drawn thick on the ground. It explains why Assad forces have ignored the UN\u2019s 30-day ceasefire resolution. Mr Putin\u2019s disregard for the resolution, by reducing it to a farcical five-hour window, shows that neither Mr Assad nor Mr Putin wants the rebels to regroup and gain strength. They want a quick and absolute victory, even if it is a bloodbath.Just as it is almost certain that the rebels of Eastern Ghouta will fall, it is equally certain Assad forces will next intensify the siege of Idlib, a north-eastern city held by the Salafi jihadist rebel group Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This pattern will continue until all rebel groups are wiped out.It is unlikely there will be any fighting between Assad forces and the Kurdish YPG, as that would mean an open confrontation between Russia and the US. After the US supported the YPG, it successfully ended Islamic State\u2019s presence in eastern Syria.The US has made it clear it is there to stay, establishing a 30,000-strong border security force as a deterrent against IS regrouping, but more importantly to stop Mr Assad attacking Kurdish regions once he clears the ground of rebel groups in his territory.The wildcard in Syria is Turkey\u2019s unpredictable president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He aims to establish Turkey in north-eastern Syria as a third major player along with Russia and the US, by fighting alongside elements of the Free Syrian Army to capture the Kurdish-controlled district of Afrin.Whether Russia and the US will allow Mr Erdogan to realise his objectives remains to be seen. He may find he is out of his league when things get tough on the ground, forcing him out of Syria.The Syrian conflict will end only if the Russian-supported Assad regime wipes out all Salafi jihadist rebel groups and regains control of western Syria and its most important cities. This may be before the end of 2018. In the meantime, the international community should be prepared to lament more civilian casualties.Mehmet Ozalp is an Associate Professor in Islamic Studies, Director of The Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation and Executive Member of Public and Contextual Theology, Charles Sturt UniversityThis story originally appeared in The Conversation and has been republished here with permission.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

This won\u2019t make you an instant expert, but it\u2019ll sure help.A suicide attack claimed by Islamic State killed more than 40 people in the Kurdish-dominated city of Qamishli in Northern Syria early Wednesday. Kurdish officials said the suicide bomber drove into a busy checkpoint. Photo: Getty ImagesTHIS is a complicated war. This is a messy, cruel war where neither side has much regard for civilian casualties.This war is not black-and-white. You might think it\u2019s the brave rebels versus the evil dictatorial regime, and that\u2019s part of the story. But it\u2019s not all of it. Not by a long way.Confused about Syria? Us too. But this quick 10-point explainer will help. To help us navigate this tragic conflict, we spoke to two Australians with a unique view on the troubled nation.We spoke to Dr Rodger Shanahan, former peacekeeper in Syria and non-resident Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy.And we spoke to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who this year travelled to Syria on a humanitarian mission. You can read his blog here at prayersforsyria.com.1. SyriaA country smaller than the state of Victoria with almost the exact same population as Australia (22.5 million to our 23 million) which borders Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon. Syria has both deserts and fertile areas and is steeped in history dating back to biblical times.2. The Syrian regimeThe Syrian Civil war is a conflict between its long-serving government and those seeking to boot it out of office. The Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar al-Assad.Unlike many regime leaders in the middle east middle, The Assad family is not religiously extreme. They are Alawites \u2013 a relatively obscure branch of Islam which is not particularly hard-line. So the people have not been protesting against hard-line Islamists, as happened in other countries which participated in the Arab Spring uprisings.But people are still angry at their government. As Rodger Shanahan points out, what they\u2019re angry about is the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms.3. The Civil War beginsRodger Shanahan says the catalyst was the jailing on March 6, 2011, of some children who painted anti-regime graffiti. Some were killed in detention, and this led to public protests which spread around the country \u2013 fuelled by the failure of the government to punish the perpetrators.Another theory says the war started with demonstrations which mirrored those in neighbouring countries, and which soon led to a security crackdown. In April 2011, the Syrian Army fired on demonstrators and the protests became a full-scale armed rebellion.4. The rebellion grows\u2026By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed. As Dr Shanahan explains, the FSA never existed before that. \u201cLocal areas formed their own militias with the aim of toppling the government without any co-ordination or centralised command or control,\u201d he says.\u201cThe militias were a combination of local area tribal groups, deserters from the military [who had been conscripted despite holding anti-government beliefs] and disaffected locals.\u201dThen a combination of Jihadists, some from Syria and some from elsewhere, joined the FSA. Some even came from the faraway Caucasus region \u2013 where accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev originally hailed from.So in other words, you had genuine Syrian freedom fighters joined by people with their own Islamist agendas. But because the FSA was underarmed and undermanned, they had little choice but to form a loose coalition with these volatile new kids on the revolutionary block.5. And pretty soon, bad guys on both sides are killing civilians\u2026As Father Dave Smith says, \u201cthe way it\u2019s been depicted the last couple of years, you get the impression the rebels are Robin Hood and his band of merry men, and that all they want is freedom and justice for all. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201dFather Dave illustrates his point with a communication he had with a Syrian woman which he published on his blog. The woman\u2019s name is Ghinwa and she wrote by text:\u201cThe situation is very bad now in Latakia province. 7 Alawite villages were massacred. We know about the killing of 136 villagers all killed on sectarian bases. A friend of mind lost 21 member of his relatives.\u201cAll of my friends who were documenting the name and the events of massacres in Latakia against Alawites are now being threatened to be killed by FSA and Al Nusra terrorists \u2026 On TV we are shown something different. It is only a propaganda. They\u2019re trying to say that Alawites are not being killed or displaced. The truth is being hidden by mass media. .. This is sick\u2026 My sister now is very ill \u2026 I guess a part of her illness is caused by sadness \u2026 we are afraid.\u201dA quick recap. Alawites are the ethnicity of the ruling family. The fact they were allegedly being killed by rebel groups suggests the rebels are not all angels.6. Civilian casualties\u201cThere are accusations of atrocities on both sides,\u201d Rodger Shanahan confirms. We should believe some of them, absolutely. There\u2019s no accurate confirmation, but it\u2019s a nasty horrible civil war with people on both sides getting killed.Dr Shanahan says there is evidence that opposition car bombs have killed countless civilians in the name of taking out a government target. But there are equally distressing reports that government soldiers executed civilians. Others, shockingly, were executed for taking a moral stance and failing to follow orders to execute civilians.Like we said, it\u2019s a bloody mess. Literally. The death toll in the war is now said to be well over 100,000.7. The president\u2019s wifeAllow us to break up this tale with a story of the president\u2019s wife. Her name is Asma al-Assad and she was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. She\u2019s smart, glamorous and she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 \u2013 just months before he became president.In March 2011, the American version of Vogue magazine ran a long, glowing profile of Asma al-Assad. Talk about bad timing. The story was soon removed from Vogue\u2019s website and the journalist who wrote it tried to cover her tracks by penning a separate story elsewhere entitled \u201cFirst Lady of Hell\u201d.Even as the Civil war rages, the Assad family remains popular with many middle class Syrians, especially urbanised Sunni Muslims, says Dr Rodger Shanahan. \u201cThey still prefer him to the opposition,\u201d he says.8. Refugee hellThe United Nations estimates that more than 1.5 million refugees have now fled Syria. Father David Smith visited several camps across the border in Lebanon \u2013 a country whose population of 4.3 million is bulging with the influx of a total of nearly 2 million Palestinian and Syrian refugees.\u201cThe camps I saw were deeply impressive,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cEvery Palestinian family took in two, maybe three Syrian families. These included polygamous families which presented a whole new problem. The wives often lived in separate houses in Syria but now they were not just under the same roof but sleeping on the same floor. The domestic violence and rape problems are enormous. I was deeply impressed with camp and people running it.\u201d9. Chemical weaponsJust who unleashed the chemical weapons attack which killed hundreds of children and other civilians last week \u2013 and why? UN weapons inspectors arrived yesterday with a mandate to find that out. And when they do, it will affect what the world does next.\u201cThey have a mandate to say whether a chemical attack occurred but not to apportion blame,\u201d Dr Shanahan cautions. \u201cFirst, they have to establish whether an incident occurred [it is still disputed by some] and at what level the action was authorised. It is plausible that Assad didn\u2019t authorise it but a local commander did.\u201d10. What happens nextThe world waits. \u201cYou would think the way diplomatic manoeuvrings are going that if there is some kind of military strike it would be quite limited,\u201d Dr Shanahan says. \u201cIt would be punitive, not designed to tip the military balance.\u201dIn other words, no Iraq-style invasion or prolonged Western intervention.And Father Dave\u2019s opinion of what comes next? He doesn\u2019t know. But he\u2019s praying. He speaks of a man he met in Syria who said he\u2019s gone \u201cfrom unemployment to slavery\u201d. That\u2019s his way of saying the revolution has so far achieved a whole bunch of nothing except bloodshed and dislocation.\u201cI see the faces of all those beautiful people and I pray,\u201d he says.Continue the conversation @antsharwood@newscomauHQ@GhinwaMaia@fatherdaveNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Now the world awaits Bashar al-Assad\u2019s next move.THE brutal dictator behind one of the worst atrocities the world has seen this century got the job by accident. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine.But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career.Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade.When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded.But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants.ACCIDENTAL RULERThe al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father\u2019s death.According to the Lowy Institute\u2019s Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change.\u201cHe had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\u201d Dr Shanahan said.But that didn\u2019t happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government.\u201cYou can\u2019t open up free speech in a closed political system,\u201d he said.GLAMOROUS MODERN WIFEAsma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 \u2014 just months before he became president.From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial \u2014 the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni.As Syria\u2019s First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women\u2019s rights and education.The couple have three children.RISE OF A DICTATORAssad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists.But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent.One of Assad\u2019s first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reformsBut the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving.Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands.A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed.The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad\u2019s Ba\u2019ath Party holding effective power.The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied.Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013.Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria.The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province.SPARKING A WARThe Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam.While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school.Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad\u2019s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.REBELS OR ISLAMIC STATE?Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra.And the messy, long and complicated war isn\u2019t just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot actually.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city.But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL?The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib.The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces.IS ASSAD LIKED?Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask.Domestically he\u2019s generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments.Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him.But millions of others have suffered.Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries.But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war.Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey.\u201cIraqis have remained neutral with their support of Assad.\u201d Dr Shanahan said.\u201cJordanians just wish it would all go away and Lebanon have always had a funny stance with Syria.\u201cThe Gulf states oppose Assad.\u201dWILL HE LOSE POWER?Dr Shanahan said the Gulf States have been pressuring Assad to step down for years and that hasn\u2019t worked.However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story.\u201cThe US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don\u2019t see this situation changing anytime soon,\u201d he said.debra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

But the before and after photos are pretty hard to forget.We take a look at how Syria and the city Aleppo has change over the last six years with the conflict of war.ONCE regarded as a political and military heavyweight in the Middle East, this country was rich in trade, ancient archaeological sites and boasted an innovative IT industry.Today, its cities and towns are in pieces and the war in Syria has become the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.With more than 300,000 Syrians killed and six million people who have fled or displaced, the war in Syria was last night described on Q&A as \u201cthe biggest story on the planet\u201d. Host Tony Jones said \u201cwe rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people\u201d.Syria descended into full-scale civil war in 2012, causing about half the country\u2019s pre-war population to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadists.And while the world now sees a country devastated by years of war and left in ruins, it wasn\u2019t always this way.Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt told Q&A that Syria was \u201cquite a normal country\u201d eight years ago.He\u2019s not the only one, many people remember a country that was once thriving.One refugee Tara, who fled Syria in 2011, told Amnesty International her country had one of the oldest and sophisticated literary traditions in the world along with a vibrant film industry.She also revealed how Syria has been part of the major empires of history, including Egyptian, Persian and Roman.Syria\u2019s cities were filled with souks and bustling marketplaces which served as a crucial meeting and cultural point while bakeries and sweet shops were found on most corners.Today Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, has all but been obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Once the beating heart of Syria\u2019s industrial and commercial industries, it has witnessed some of the most brutal violence of the country\u2019s six-year war.Before and after photos of the Old City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, show the full extent of the catastrophic destruction which has taken place.Aleppo was pummelled by air strikes last December, shrinking the rebel enclave just days ahead of parallel talks in France and Switzerland which aimed to save the Syrian city from \u201ccomplete\u201d destruction.The city\u2019s east \u2014 a rebel stronghold since 2012 \u2014 has been the target of a major assault by forces loyal to President Bashar\u2019s Russian-backed regime.During last December\u2019s air strikes, Ibrahim Abu al-Leith, spokesman for the White Helmets rescue force inside Aleppo described the terror many left behind faced.\u201cThe streets are full of people under the rubble. They are dying because we can\u2019t get them out,\u201d he told AFP.As news.com.au reported last December, the war in Syria has been described as the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.While the Syrian army announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26, the conflict is far from over.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

A Western perspective on the crisis", "classes": ["intro", "description"], "content": "AS DESPERATE people flee in their millions, Australia is launching headlong into this hell on Earth. This is what they are running from.ALMOST exactly two years ago, as the full horror of Syria\u2019s civil war revealed itself to the world, news.com.au published a basic explainer piece.That piece, entitled 10 simple points to help you understand the Syria conflict, went on to be one of the most clicked stories ever produced by this website.To this day, people continue to read it. At any given moment in the day or night, 40 or 50 people from around the world are reading it as they try to comprehend the desperately complicated Syrian situation. Those numbers have surged in recent days and weeks for obvious reasons.But our original piece is now out of date. So much has happened since 2013, including this afternoon\u2019s announcement that Australia will carry out air strikes against Islamic State (IS).That\u2019s why we\u2019ve produced this update, with fresh comment from the same two Australian experts we consulted two years ago.We\u2019ve again spoken to Dr Rodger Shanahan, a former peacekeeper in Syria who is now a Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, as well as Associate Professor at the National Security College at the Australian National University (ANU).And we spoke once more to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who has now made four humanitarian missions to Syria, the most recent in July. You can read Father Dave\u2019s blog here at prayersforsyria.com1. A reminder of Syria and its origins as a countrySyria is a middle eastern nation with a small strip of Mediterranean coastline. Its overall area is a little smaller than the United Kingdom. Syria first became an independent nation in 1945 and has been formally known as the Arab Republic of Syria since 1991.Though it has pretences of being democratic, Syria has been led by the al-Assad family for 45 years. Hafez al-Assad ruled from 1970 to 2000. His first son died in a car crash and his second, Bashar al-Assad, has been president since 2000.2. How the civil war startedIn 2011, the people of several middle eastern and North African countries rose up against their leaders in a movement which became known as the Arab Spring. Many of the overthrown leaders were hard-line Islamists. Syria\u2019s ruling family have never been that. The Assad family are Alawites \u2014 a branch of Islam which is relatively liberal.But despite living under a regime which allowed religious and other freedoms, many Syrians were still no fans of Bashar al-Assad. Angry about the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms, and emboldened by the Arab Spring uprisings, a series of anti-government protests began.For several reasons the protests soon turned ugly. A key flashpoint was the deaths (in detention) of some children who had painted anti-regime graffiti. There were also moments when the government brutally cracked down on protests, firing into the crowd.Soon, ordinary Syrians took up arms. Many of them were disenchanted former members of Assad\u2019s military. Others were ordinary citizens. As things escalated into a full scale civil war, they were joined by a ragtag bunch of jihadists and others, who crossed borders to join the action on the side of the anti-government rebels.3. And the war raged on and on: it is impossibly messyIn the two years since we first tackled this issue, the Syrian Civil War has turned into a conflict so complicated, even the experts admit it almost defies description. It\u2019s also a war no one is really winning or can win.\u201cThe war is at stalemate right now with the Syrian government in control of western and central Syria around Damascus, and with patchy control over parts of Aleppo in the north,\u201d explains Dr Shanahan. \u201cIslamic state is more eastern Syria-focused but it\u2019s also in northern Syria.\u201cThere are also a variety of groups like Jabhat al-Nusra which is Al-Qaeda aligned. The bottom line is it\u2019s bloody complex.\u201d4. To make matters more complicated, everyone now has different aimsIn truth, this war was about Syrians versus the Assad regime for about five minutes. Then came the jihadists and then came IS, which as Dr Shanahan explains, wants to expand the caliphate it has loosely established in Iraq and parts of Syria across the whole of Syria.A caliphate, by the way, is a region governed by hard-line Islamic rule.But as Dr Shanahan explains, the problem here is competing goals. Every player in this war wants something different.\u201cThe non Islamist [rebel] groups don\u2019t like Assad, IS want to expand the caliphate, groups like Jabhat al-Nusra want Islamic rule in Syria under their leadership, other Islamist groups want Islamic government although what that looks like and how it might be achieved is never articulated. But they all want Islamic rule in one way, shape, or form.\u201d5. So basically you\u2019ve got an unwinnable war.Dr Shanahan again: \u201cI think what will end up happening is something short of the collapse of the Assad regime. A reasonable outcome you\u2019d think is a \u2018regime lite\u2019 where Assad is not the ruler at an agreed time in the future, and where some opposition elements are incorporated in the government and military. How you get there is the difficulty.\u201d6. Meanwhile the bodies stack upTwo years ago, the death toll including civilians and combatants was around 100 thousand. That figure is now generally estimated to be 240 thousand. That\u2019s about 1400 Syrians killed as a direct or indirect result of this conflict each week over the last two years. To help you put those numbers in perspective, Syria\u2019s overall population is almost identical to Australia\u2019s 23 million.7. And the number of refugees is staggering. So why are they heading to Europe now?By most measures, it appears that as many as 11 million Syrians have been displaced. Of those, 4.1 million have fled the country and been registered as refugees with the UNHCR. The real number of refugees outside Syria is probably much higher.Why are they heading to Europe now?\u201cMy understanding is that the refugees are moving from Turkey [which shares a southern border with Syria] and my understanding is they are moving from there [towards Europe] because people smugglers have found a route less dangerous and cheaper,\u201d Dr Shanahan says.\u201cPeople can\u2019t move in that kind of mass movement without people smugglers who have made the journey more accessible and cheaper. There has been no massive escalation in the war itself. People are just saying \u2018we can make it to Europe now so let\u2019s do it\u2019. It\u2019s a case of risk versus return. It\u2019s also summer now in the northern hemisphere, which is a much better time to make a dangerous trip like this than winter.Unfortunately, as we all saw with the tragic case of drowned toddler Aylan Kurdi, the risk side of that equation remains devastatingly real.8. Meanwhile, what\u2019s life like for those who remain in Syria?With four humanitarian missions under his belt, Father David Smith has some amazing insights into the lives of those who both literally and figuratively soldier on in Syria.He recalls one man he met who joined the rebels because they paid 50 dollars a month and all the cigarettes he could smoke. But he soon figured out that his commander was not even a Syrian (and was probably IS aligned). \u201cI had gone from poverty and unemployment to slavery and beheadings,\u201d the man told Father Dave.Another man told Father Dave, with his young pretty wife beside him and baby bouncing on his knee, how he\u2019d done his bit for the army by killing up to 1500 people. He wasn\u2019t boasting. He was merely acknowledging how the moral goalposts have shifted in the mess that is present day Syria.Yet the country itself is far from entirely dysfunctional. \u201cSyria is going a lot better than Iraq thanks be to God,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cThere is a fully functioning bureaucracy. Unlike Lebanon, where garbage has not been collected for months, the garbage is collected in Syria.\u201dAs the country somehow stays functional in most areas, its people maintain their spirits.\u201cEverywhere we went on our most recent trip in July, we saw thousands of kids, and all had fire in the eyes. They were full of life and spirit.\u201cThe streetlife was extraordinary, despite no lighting at night. People were dancing and drinking and saying \u2018I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to be alive, we might as well enjoy life\u2019.\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t see was a sense of resignation,\u201d Father Dave says. \u201cThere is a very strong sense of patriotic solidarity in Syria. People are gathering around the flag and around Assad, even if it\u2019s not to do with him as a person or any decisions he has made.\u201dIt would be ironic if this war, which started as an anti-Assad crusade, ends up making people feel that Assad is the safe option. But there is evidence that the chaos caused by all the various factions in this war may produce exactly that result among the Syrians left behind.It\u2019s doubly ironic given Dr Shanahan\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe one thing unites all the opposition groups, whether Islamists or Free Syrian Army, is that Assad must leave\u201d.Yet Dr Shanahan concedes that Assad may well represent \u201cif nothing else, stability in a time of chaos\u201d.9. What about Russia, the Saudis and other external players like the US and Australia?In short, there is strong evidence the Saudis are funding IS and others involved in Syria. Remember that Syria\u2019s Assad regime are Shia Muslims while the Saudi regime and most Saudis are Sunni Muslims. So the Saudi desire to replace a Shia regime with Sunni Islam is just one of the complications which deeply underpins this conflict.Iran is also in the mix. What you need to know about Iran is that it is more than 90 per cent Shia. So it has a natural ally with Syria\u2019s rulers and natural enemies elsewhere in the Middle East and Gulf region. So Iran has strong reasons to be supporting the ruling regime.Russia is an interesting player. It has a base in the Syrian port of Tartus, from where it is just over 1000 nautical miles to Russia\u2019s Black Sea naval bases. Russia supports the Assad regime, which the west does not. Remember, Assad is said to have committed atrocities against his own citizens, including the use of chemical weapons (a claim which is disputed). So the west is not exactly Assad\u2019s best friend.But nor is the west a friend of the rebels, given the rebels are such a loose, disparate collective which includes IS. In fact we want to bomb IS.10. So should we bomb IS? Will this in some way help stop the war?\u201cThe Americans\u2019 grand scheme is to degrade IS to relieve pressure on Syrian army units and make room for other people that they\u2019ve trained,\u201d Dr Shanahan explains.With Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing a series of air strikes on IS in Syria, experts like Dr Shanahan remain unconvinced of what they\u2019ll achieve.\u201cWhy should Australia bomb Syria? Australia has only got six aircraft. What operational effect will that have? There has just been no strategic intent. The government is wanting to show solidarity with the Americans, but it\u2019s not going to have any kind of operational effect.\u201dAbout the only thing we do know for sure is that Syria remains a mess. We\u2019d like to offer you a more hopeful conclusion. But the main reason the world has been standing back and not doing much in Syria is because it\u2019s unclear how to make a difference.That\u2019s one reason why the world\u2019s attention has swung to the refugee crisis. In this area at least, it\u2019s a little clearer how to contribute in a positive way.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why Syria has remained such a combustible mix. Photo: GettySYRIA was the last outpost of Communist Russia\u2019s imperial dreams.President Vladimir Putin did not want to let it go.Now, according to an assessment published in the professional journal of the US Army, the  Military Review, he\u2019s won.By direct implication, this implies a serious strategic setback for the United States.The Syrian Civil War has seen hundreds of thousands killed in more than 12 years of fighting.It was sparked by an uprising during what was then known as the \u201cArab Spring\u201d \u2014 a democratic surge among the newly social-media linked citizens of the Middle East.But the Arab Winter has since well and truly set in.US trained and supplied Syrian rebels have failed to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, they spent much of their force rolling back Islamic State.Assad himself has found renewed security in Moscow\u2019s embrace.\u201cThe Syrian conflict will likely enter a new phase in 2018, as both Islamic State and the Syrian opposition cease to be relevant forces, and the two coalitions seek to negotiate a postconflict settlement,\u201d the assessment reads.\u201cWhile it is far from assured that any settlement acceptable to the principle domestic and international players can be struck, for now the main outcome of this war is that President Bashar al-Assad will stay, but the Syria that existed before the war is gone.\u201dWAKING THE BEARPost Cold-War Russia has been concerned by the United States\u2019 ongoing interventions worldwide.It didn\u2019t like the idea of military intervention in Libya to oust Ghadaffis\u2019 regime. And the prospect of assertive \u201cregime change\u201d in its former client state of Syria was even more unpalatable.This appeared to be the case in 2011, when then President of the United States Barack Obama declared President Assad a dictator and demanded he step aside.Russia immediately set about blocking any intervention in Syria through the United Nations, and began quietly restocking Assad\u2019s arsenal.But soon Assad found himself in trouble.His forces had retreated to a few coastal and border cities. Rebels held much of Syria\u2019s heartland. And the black flag of Islamic State was rolling in from the Iraq desert.So, in 2015, Moscow directly intervened.It sent in its combat jets.\u201cRussia has only been directly involved in this conflict since September 2015, but its intervention has radically changed the war\u2019s outcome,\u201d the US Army publication states. \u201cThe natural question is whether Russia has, in fact, won a victory.\u201dPUTIN\u2019S GAMBITMoscow, the assessment argues, didn\u2019t want to look weak.It was struggling to adapt to international pressure and sanctions imposed after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the shadow-invasion of eastern Ukraine.\u201cRather than giving in to Western pressure and offering concessions on Ukraine, Moscow looked to Syria to broaden the confrontation on terms more favourable to itself,\u201d the article says. \u201cEventually, Russia hoped its Syrian intervention could force Washington and its European allies to abandon Ukraine-related sanctions and diplomatic isolation in the interests of achieving a negotiated settlement with Russia over Syria.\u201dSince 2015, Russian forces have shored up Assad\u2019s front lines.There have been few retreats. Now, his troops are advancing once again.And Russian bombers are frequently seen in the skies of the last rebel strongholds, such as the city of Ghouta.RELATED: Russia\u2019s Su-57 stealth fighter faces-off against US F-22\u201cA successful intervention could offer victory on three fronts: preventing US-backed regime change in Syria, breaking out of political isolation and forcing Washington to deal with Russia as an equal, and demonstrating at home that Russia is a great power on the main stage of international politics,\u201d the US army assessment states. \u201cMoscow hoped Syria would offer a new and more favourable front, where the United States could be outmanoeuvred in the broader confrontation.\u201dNow, in 2018, Assad\u2019s position is once again secure.Islamic State is all but defeated.US-supported rebel forces are being rolled back.The Kurd separatist ethnic group in the north is buckling under a Turkish invasion.And US/Coalition combat jets and ground-forces can do little but look on.In this broad context, it does look as though Moscow can claim some sort of victory.MOSCOW\u2019S METHODS\u201cRussia has become a potential powerbroker, and perhaps a balancer against US influence, even if it did not embark on the Syrian campaign with those goals in mind,\u201d the Army press article states.Achieving such a goal was not easy.Moscow had to destroy the Syrian Rebels\u2019 capacity to fight. It had to fend off concerns from Turkey, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\u201cThe risks of escalation to direct conflict between the intervening powers were considerable, as underscored by Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons in March 2017, resulting in a prompt retaliatory US cruise missile strike, or the Turkish shoot down of a Russian Su-24M2 in November 2016,\u201d the article highlights.RELATED: US troops clash with Russian mercenaries in SyriaMoscow-controlled media was prolific in showing images of its Su-30 strike fighters and Su-24 bombers on the runway of the Hmeimim Air Base. Much ado was made about a foray by Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier, Kuznetzov, with its battlefleet into the Eastern Mediterranean.And cruise-missile strikes from Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers, along with those fired from submarines and warships, repeatedly made the headlines.Meanwhile, 2000 of its mercenaries and 3000 soldiers were on the ground in Syria, ensuring pressure was being applied where it was needed most.All the while, the battle against US-backed \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian rebels was being painted by Moscow as just another act in the war against \u201cterrorism\u201d.TRUMP\u2019S CAPITULATION\u201cOver time, Moscow achieved success on both the military and political fronts, coercing adversaries and negotiating changes to their positions one by one, though the pathway to this outcome was hardly a smooth or straightforward one,\u201d the authors note. \u201cRussia\u2019s success is not unqualified, but at the time of this writing, it appears that if the campaign in Syria is not a victory for Russia, it is certainly a defeat for those who opposed the Russian-led coalition.\u201dBut all is not clear-cut for Moscow.The US army highlights it is not truly in control of its Syria-Iran coalition.Which makes it vulnerable to fallout from their independent actions.\u201c(The) latest declaration of victory, ahead of the March 2018 presidential election, is fraught with risk since Russian forces are not just staying but further expanding the infrastructure at Tartus and Hmeimim,\u201d the assessment reads.International sanctions are still in place. And Russia is becoming increasingly associated with Assad\u2019s chemical weapons attacks.But it also notes Moscow has won international acceptance of its role as a key player in Syria\u2019s future.And with US President Donald Trump now telegraphing a rapid and complete withdrawal of US assets in Syria \u201cvery soon\u201d, this would leave President Vladimir Putin as the last man standing on top of the pile of rubble that remains behind.\u201cIn sum, Russia appears to have won at least a partial victory in Syria, and done so with impressive efficiency, flexibility, and co-ordination between military and political action,\u201d the assessment concludes. \u201cOn the one hand, Russia\u2019s embrace of the Assad regime and its Iranian allies, its relative indifference to civilian casualties, and its blanket hostility to antiregime opposition groups are fundamentally at odds with widely held US views on Syria. On the other hand, Russia\u2019s \u201clean\u201d strategy, adaptable tactics, and co-ordination of military and diplomatic initiatives offer important lessons for the conduct of any military intervention in as complex and volatile an environment as the Middle East.\u201dNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

The Syrian government has claimed victory in Aleppo but its problems are far from over.As reports mounted of regime ceasefire violations in besieged Aleppo on December 14, Jaish al-Fateh rebels inside the city mounted multiple attacks against pro-Assad forces in the southern Jisr al-Hajj area with both Grad rockets and a car bombing. The car bombing was carried out by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighter Abu Islam, according to video released by the group, previously affiliated with al-Qaeda under the Jabhat al-Nusra flag. Activist reports suggest that a number of pro-Assad forces, mostly Lebanese and Iraqi militiamen, were killed in the car bombing attack. Such incidents occurred during the daytime hours of December 14. Activists inside the city have said that clashes came to a halt during the late evening hours of December 14, just hours ahead of planned evacuations for wounded civilians out of the city. Credit: YouTube/Jaish al-Fateh via StoryfulIT HAS been a long and bloody conflict leaving hundreds of thousands dead. But despite the Syrian government claiming a victory in Aleppo, its problems are far from over.Thousands of civilians remain trapped and face a desperate fight for survival just days after President Bashar al-Assad announced the Syrian army regained control of the city from rebel forces.The once thriving commercial centre has been reduced to a war zone, and many of its once famous buildings and monuments left in ruins after five long and brutal years of civil war.So how did it get this way?WHAT\u2019S GOING ON?The Syrian army on Monday announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26.Along with Aleppo, the Syrian government also controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria, Deir Az Zor, most of the territory along the border with Lebanon as well as most of the northwestern coast. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State and Kurdish forces.IS THERE STILL FIGHTING?Yes, despite Assad claiming a victory in Aleppo, the city remains in the grip of conflict and confusion.Just today, a ceasefire to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held neighbourhoods of Aleppo unravelled, once again raising the spectre of a bloody end to the battle for Syria\u2019s largest city.Residents reported shelling and brutal bombing runs had resumed while Assad opponents accused the government and its allies of scuttling the deal by adding new conditions, including the lifting of a rebel siege on two pro-government Shiite villages in nearby Idlib province. However, hours after it crumbled, the rebels insist the deal was back on.HOW DID THE CIVIL WAR START?In 2011, Syria was caught up in the Arab Spring uprising which saw Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak toppled from power.That March, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad\u2019s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.WHAT WERE THEY ANGRY ABOUT?The Assad family has held power in the country since 1971.The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?Rebels seized eastern Aleppo in July 2012, dividing the city, resulting in intense fighting and bombs being dropped on the densely populated rebel-held east, causing an estimated one million civilians to flee. Another half million were displaced.Things got messier in August after insurgents gained control of the Aleppo-Damascus highway, tightening the siege on the government part of the city.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot, not only does the Syrian government have rebels to contend with but also Islamic State forces as well.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in the eastern part of the city.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.Around 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHO\u2019S INVOLVED?Aside from Syrian forces, Russia, Iran and even Lebanon have bolstered Assad in the civil war.In October 2015, Russia began air strikes while Syrian troops launched an offensive around Aleppo. Iraqi, Lebanese and Iranian militias also threw their weight behind the government.Meanwhile several Arab states, along with Turkey, provided support to rebel groups in Syria, Al Jazeera reported.The US has accused President Assad of being responsible for widespread atrocities and want to see him out of power. So far though it has tried to avoid taking part in any attacks which might directly benefit the Syrian army.It supports Syria\u2019s main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, and also provides limited military assistance to moderate rebels, the BBC reported.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) receives support from the US Central Intelligence Agency, while the Kurdish Popular Defence Units (YPG and YPJ) receive support from the US Department of Defence, according to Quartz.In September 2014, the US joined the international coalition against Islamic State but has avoided intervening in battles between rebel and Assad forces.DEADLY COST TO HUMANITYPeople on both sides have been killed, and the death toll from the civil war is now estimated to stand at 312,000 according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The toll includes more than 53,000 rebels and nearly 110,000 pro-regime fighters, among them more than 60,000 Syrian soldiers. But it also includes tens of thousands of Syrian militiamen, members of Lebanon\u2019s Shiite Hezbollah movement and other foreign fighters.However according to Al Jazeera the death toll from the conflict is closer to 450,000 with 12 million Syrians displaced.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called on the Syrian government, Russia and Iran to urgently allow civilians to escape Aleppo.\u201cWe have collectively failed the people of Syria,\u201d he said at a UN Security Council meeting. \u201cHistory will not easily absolve us.\u201dBoth the west and the UN claim civilians have been intentionally killed, but the Syrian army has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured.It is also feared civilians are too scared to flee and thousands remain hidden, trusting neither side to keep them safe.WASN\u2019T THERE ALREADY A CEASE FIRE?Yes, in February this year Russia and the US brokered a ceasefire with rebels that excluded extremists, however it was short-lived and it collapsed just two months later.In July the government and allied forces imposed a full siege on eastern Aleppo, home to an estimated 250,000 people. Rebel fighters broke the siege for a couple of weeks but it was reimposed by August. The following month another ceasefire negotiated by Russia and the US held for a few days, but talks to bring in aid got nowhere.Soon after Russia announced it was suspending air strikes in eastern Aleppo so aid and medical evacuations could get in and out. But rebels rejected the offer and the UN announced it couldn\u2019t carry out medical evacuations due to security concerns.WHAT NOW?Last month, the Syrian army launched a renewed and intensified aerial campaign. Syrian troops and allied forces launched a major ground offensive, causing rebel defences to crumble and thousands to flee.A ceasefire, brokered by Turkey and Russia, was announced overnight to allow the evacuation of rebels and civilians and effectively surrendering the city to the government.But it never truly took hold on the ground and government shelling continues.\u2014 with AP and AFPdebra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Now shocking statistics reveal the extent of the damage done to Syria\u2019s lost generation. IT REPRESENTS the greatest humanitarian challenge of our time. Five years of intense fighting has plunged a once vibrant country into darkness. The destruction and despair wrought by the Syrian Civil War has caused a \u201csystematic\u201d obliteration of infrastructure and population. Such is the backward direction of the country, that from 2010 to 2015, the average life expectancy fell by a staggering 20 years.Just five years ago the life expectancy of a child born in Syria was 75.9 years, but that number has since fallen to an estimated 55.7 years. In contrast, the average life expectancy in Australia is 82.2 years.A complete death toll in the war is impossible to pin down, but estimates from aid organisations and the United Nations put the number at more than 270,000 people \u2014 thousands more than the number killed in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.According to aid organisation Mercy Corps, \u201chalf the country\u2019s pre-war population \u2014 more than 11 million people \u2014 have been killed or forced to flee their homes\u201d.The UN estimates close to four million Syrians have fled the country \u2014 a trend that has fuelled an incredibly difficult European refugee crisis that has dominated global headlines.A further seven million Syrians are believed to be internally displaced due to the fighting, and those left behind face almost impossible circumstances.A shocking 80 per cent of Syrians are now deemed to be living in poverty. More than three million have lost their jobs since fighting broke out in 2010, according to a 2015 UN-backed report.Unemployment has surged from 14.9 per cent in 2011 to 57.7 per cent at the end of 2014.\u201cThirty per cent of the population have descended into abject poverty where households struggle to meet the basic food needs to sustain bare life,\u201d the report said.Of the millions displaced and suffering, Syria\u2019s children are bearing the brunt of the crisis and have been dubbed the country\u2019s \u201clost generation\u201d.An estimated four million Syrian children are out of school or any formal education at the moment, adding to the disastrous long term effects of the conflict.\u201cThe scale of the crisis for children is growing all the time, which is why there are now such fears that Syria is losing a whole generation of its youth,\u201d said Peter Salama, regional director of the UN\u2019s Children\u2019s Fund.A majority of the country live half their lives under a blanket of darkness as the damage accumulated in the war has caused 83 per cent of the country\u2019s electricity to be cut.An image taken from space at night shows how the lights have slowly faded from the night sky over Syria.The images above were taken by a team of researchers from Wuhan University in China from satellites 800km above the earth.\u201cThese satellite images help us understand the suffering and fear experienced by ordinary Syrians as their country is destroyed around them,\u201d said Dr Xi Li, the lead researcher on the project, in a statement.While the emotional toll of the ongoing civil war is impossible to define, the financial cost is so far projected to have surpassed $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue.\u201cWith the economic and structural losses and the destruction of oil resources, agriculture, industry, trade, infrastructure and the displacement of millions of people, the total losses suffered by Syria easily exceeds 200 billion dollars,\u201d the head of the Syrian Economic Task Force, Osama Kadi, said last year.Homs, the third largest city in Syria, has been reduced to rubble and today shows a faint flicker of the life it once held. Drone footage circulated online last week shows the devastation suffered by the city and led prominent Middle East commentator, Maajid Nawaz, to comment: \u201cAre we fighting to control cities of rubble?\u201dTHE LATESTPeace talks stalled last week as the Syrian army secured a major battlefield victory against insurgent rebels, and Russia vowed to continue its aerial bombardment in support of the Assad regime.The continued fighting marred the fragile peace talks, which rebel groups said they would refuse to join until Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stopped attacking Syrian rebels.Peace talks are set to resume on February 25.The aid group Mercy Corps says intensified air strikes and fighting around Aleppo have cut off the main humanitarian route into the Syrian city, and that tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing north toward the border with Turkey.David Evans, Mercy Corps\u2019 regional program director for the Middle East, said in a statement on Thursday that the group\u2019s operations in northern Syria \u201chave been effectively sliced in half.\u201dTens of thousands of Syrians who fled the Russia-backed government offensive in Aleppo are now stranded at the border with Turkey.Turkey has vowed to help the crowds of people, including many women and children, but has not opened its borders and aid agencies have warned they are facing a \u201cdesperate\u201d situation as they wait for help.\u201cTurkey has reached the limit of its capacity to absorb the refugees,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told CNN Turk television.\u201cBut in the end, these people have nowhere else to go. Either they will die beneath the bombings ... or we will open our borders.\u201cWe are not in a position to tell them not to come. If we do, we would be abandoning them to their deaths.\u201dTurkey\u2019s Oncupinar border crossing, which faces the Bab al-Salama frontier post inside Syria, remained closed on Sunday as thousands of refugees gathered there for a third day waiting for the gate to open.One small piece of good news came last week as world leaders pledged more than $US10 billion to help fund schools, shelter and jobs for the refugees of Syria\u2019s civil war.The money was pledged following an aid conference in London last Thursday (Friday AEDT) and, according to British Prime Minister David Cameron, \u201cwill save lives, will give hope, will give people the chance of a future\u201d.\u201cNever has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.\u201cThe promises of long-term funding and loans mean that humanitarian and development partners will be able to work together to get children back into school, design employment programs and begin rebuilding infrastructure.\u201dTHE NUMBERS\u25cf More than 270,000 killed\u25cf Life expectancy reduced by 20 years\u25cf Four million Syrians are external refugees\u25cf Nearly seven million are displaced inside the country\u25cf Four out of five Syrians live in poverty\u25cf Unemployment has risen to nearly 60 per cent\u25cf Four million children are missing out on formal schooling\u25cf More than 80 per cent of country\u2019s electricity has been cut\u25cf More than $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue\u25cf Thirteen million in need of assistance\u25cf Largest current refugee crisis in the worldNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Here\u2019s why we\u2019re all turning a blind eye. The affluent and third world countries seem to barely acknowledge conflict in Syria due to how it is as seen as hopeless. The Australian's Paul Kelly addresses the tragedy. Courtesy: Q&AIT\u2019S been dubbed the \u201cbiggest story on the planet\u201d.So why does the West largely turn a blind eye to the deadliest conflict of the 21st century?That was one of the questions put to the panel on the ABC\u2019s Q&A program on Monday night.Host Tony Jones said the war in Syria was \u201cprobably the biggest story on the planet but we rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people\u201d.According to Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt, Syria was \u201cquite a normal country\u201d about eight years ago.\u201cI was there and met President Assad,\u201d Ms Thorning Schmidt said.\u201cIt was beginning to become a normal country. Now we have six million people who have fled and so many children who are traumatised perhaps for life about what has happened there.\u201dMore than 300,000 Syrians have been killed in the ongoing armed conflict which started with anti-government protests before escalating into a full-scale civil war on July 19, 2012.The War in Syria has caused millions of Syrians \u2014 about half the country\u2019s pre-war population \u2014 to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadist militants including those from Islamic State.The widespread destruction of infrastructure has seen Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, all but obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Ms Thorning Schmidt said the organisation was calling on all countries to engage in a Security Council agreement.\u201c(It includes) rules of war that the warring partner will live by where you don\u2019t bomb schools, you don\u2019t bomb hospitals, you get access for humanitarian workers to get in and pick children and people up to get them to safe spaces and hospitals,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot we could be doing and it\u2019s been very, very difficult to work in Aleppo and other places.\u201d\u201cIt is important that we just sit back and urge everyone who is a warring party in that conflict, and there\u2019s a few, to just live by some very simple rules where you should not be bombing a hospital.\u201cYou should not be bombing humanitarian aid workers that are trying to get access into the cities, you should not be bombing schools.\u201d\u2018THE DEGREE OF DAMAGE TO HUMAN LIFE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE\u2019The Australian editor-at-large Paul Kelly said there was a \u201csense of hopelessness\u201d about the war in Syria.\u201cThe outlook, as far as I can see, is pretty bleak at the moment,\u201d Mr Kelly said.\u201cThere have been efforts at negotiations. They haven\u2019t been successful.\u201cThe degree of destruction and damage to human life is incomprehensible.\u201dMr Kelly said the war \u201cdefied our sense of humanity (and) political imagination\u201d.\u201cThe idea 10 years ago this would have happened to Syria would have been beyond any sort of human understanding,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd the parties, the parties are locked in this conflict and they seem to be willing at this stage to continue the conflict for their own particular objectives.\u201dSHOULD AUSTRALIA INCREASE FOREIGN AID TO SYRIA?The panel also discussed whether or not countries including Australia were taking serious steps to end the conflict and increase foreign aid.The talk soon moved to who funded terrorists in Syria and whether or not Australia should cut supplies to the country.Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the major players were not just the Assad regime and Islamic State.\u201cThe Russians are heavily involved and with a veto at the UN Security Council, that has put a block on united action through the UN,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\u201cIran is a Shiite country.\u201cAnd Assad is part of a minority group \u2014 only 13 per cent of Syria \u2014 but a Shiite sect. So Iran is heavily involved providing support through Hezbollah to the Syrian regime.\u201dThe panel heard Saudis and other Gulf Arab states have also been involved in \u201cfunding the other side\u201d.\u201cIt plays to a much bigger schism in the Islamic world between the Sunni and the Shiite sects,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\u201cAnd the US, famously Obama said, there is a red line here.\u201cIf they use chemical weapons, we\u2019ll take action.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of evidence to suggest that red line was crossed but no subsequent action was taken.\u201dThe final word went to Ms Thorning Schmidt who said it was important not to let other countries with people suffering be forgotten.\u201cLet\u2019s not forget we have about 14 million right now who are in a serious situation, many in risk of famine in the horn of Africa,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s a toxic mix between war and drought, climate change, poverty, everything\u2019s happened there.

But what happened when cameras left the town of walking \u201cskeletons\u201d?In the Syrian town of Madaya, children and villagers were denied food for so long they resembled skeletons.IT\u2019S the town that made global headlines after it was revealed that, after eating all the dogs and cats, residents were so hungry they had turned to boiling grass to stay alive.Madaya, in Syria, became known as a place of living \u201cskeletons\u201d, where pregnant women were too weak to give birth and children were starved to death as a deliberate tactic of war by Syrian despot Bashar al-Assad.Now, one of only two \u201cdoctors\u201d who stayed behind has spoken about the true horror that befell Madaya once the world\u2019s media lost interest.As thousands of people finally begin to evacuate it and other besieged towns in Syria, Dr Mohammad Darwish says the world knew about what was happening in Madaya two years ago, and did nothing to stop it.In an interview with the ABC\u2019s Sophie McNeil, Dr Darwish \u2014 a dental student before the outbreak of civil war \u2014 said people inside Madaya were trapped in a living nightmare.\u201cNo matter what words I use, I still can\u2019t tell you enough about what we endured in this town,\u201d Dr Darwish said.\u201cDuring the days of the starvation, almost no people were walking on the streets, people had no energy to walk or to stand up.\u201d\u2018BAGS OF MILK FOR $100\u2019Residents at the time reported being without food for so long, they had \u201cforgotten what bread tastes like\u201d, and the ability to smuggle in supplies became so rare and risky that a bag of milk was fetching $100, or a kilo of rice $150. Malnourished mothers lost the ability to breastfeed and people had taken to boiling weeds and grass for \u201csoup.\u201d\u201cYoung people, women and children have turned into skeletons from hunger. The town needs everything,\u201d said Moaz al-Qalamuni, a journalist in Madaya said in January last year as a brutal winter and no energy for heating threatened to freeze many to death.While the Syrian Government did allow some supplies into the rebel-held town, dozens of people died of starvation as they waited for aid.Dr Darwish said more than 80 people perished from lack of food and diseases that could have been cured with proper medical treatment, while others were killed by landmines that had been ringed around the town so that no one could leave.He said the West, along with the UN Security Council and the other UN bodies, hadn\u2019t done enough to help despite knowing how dire the situation had become.\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, they let us down,\u201d he said. \u201cSpecifically us the people of Madaya and the Syrian people in general.\u201cThe world watched us die and be massacred and they did nothing.\u201dIn a Q&A on Syria:direct in August last year, the 26-year-old revealed that he, another dentist and a vet were left to treat more than 40,000 of Madaya\u2019s citizens, despite being woefully underequipped.In some circumstances, the trio couldn\u2019t offer any treatment at all.\u201cIf a situation requires major surgery, there\u2019s nothing that we can do,\u201d he said.\u201cOne time, there were three children who were injured by a landmine. They were rushed to the hospital, but we just stood there staring. The children died before our very eyes that day.\u201dDr Darwish said it was heartbreaking to watch children and babies die simply because there wasn\u2019t the equipment, training or knowledge to save them.Sometimes the best they could do was talk to doctors overseas via messaging app whatsapp for advice on what to do.WOMEN TOO WEAK TO GIVE BIRTHThe rebel-held town of Madaya has been cut off from the world for almost two years.Surrounded by Syrian Government forces and their allies, those in the town have little chance of getting out, and even less hope of getting food and supplies in.Last year the UN revealed there were credible reports of people dying of starvation in Madaya.Children soon became malnourished and lived mainly off rice, with other food difficult to attain, the BBC reported.Mothers were miscarrying and some were so weak they were unable to give birth.Landmines laid around the town meant escape was almost impossible especially for those who were chronically ill, the young and elderly.Last week residents in Madaya and surrounds were offered a glimmer of hope as hundreds of terrorised Syrians were evacuated from besieged towns under a a deal brokered by regime ally Iran and Qatar, a longtime supporter of Syrian rebel groups.However, many became stuck on Thursday at a rebel-held transit point where dozens of their fellow townspeople were killed in a weekend bombing.About 3000 evacuees left their homes in the government-controlled towns of Fuaa and Kafraya at dawn on Wednesday as part of a deal under which residents and fighters are also to be evacuated from several rebel areas surrounded by government forces.Shiite-dominated Iran has repeatedly raised concerns for the mainly Shiite residents of Fuaa and Kafraya, who are besieged by Sunni rebels and Islamists who control the surrounding Idlib province.Those leaving rebel-held areas will head to Idlib province, which is held by an opposition alliance.Under the agreement, residents and rebel fighters are being evacuated from the towns of Madaya, Zabadani, and other nearby opposition-held areas close to Damascus.A second set of evacuations which will see up to 30,000 people transferred from their homes, will take place in June.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime has presented evacuation deals as the best way to end Syria\u2019s war, which has killed more than 320,000 people and forced more than half the population from their homes.The opposition says the evacuations amount to forced relocation after years of bombardment and siege.Syria\u2019s opposition and Western leaders have accused Assad\u2019s regime of a wide range of abuses during the conflict, including a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun earlier this month that killed at least 87 people.debra.killalea@news.com.auAt least 43 people were killed and many others injured on April 15 when a blast struck a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from besieged pro-regime towns in Idlib province to an opposition-held area in west Aleppo. The blast happened at a location where an exchange between pro-regime and rebel forces was due to take place. Evacuations resumed later on April 15, under an agreement known as the Four Towns Deal. The agreement allowed rebel fighters and their families to leave the besieged rebel-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani in Damascus province and pro-regime fighters and their families to leave the besieged pro-regime towns of Kefraya and al-Foua in Idlib province, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The mood in the car was sombre. Zenobia's enthusiasm for air travel was buried under her apprehension about leaving behind her mother, my diplomat wife Hanlie, who would pack up the house and tie up loose ends. She understood these were not usual times. The route to the airport was, thankfully, clear of trouble and the armed soldiers and security intelligence officers at the five checkpoints we passed were polite and relaxed. But a couple of kilometres to the north, towards the Old City, columns of smoke could be seen rising as Government forces bombarded the Tadamon and Jobar districts, trying to flush out rebels. Since Syria's version of the Arab uprising against decaying authoritarian regimes broke out in March last year, security across the country had been steadily eroding. In December, big car bombs hit two security compounds in Kafer Suseh, central Damascus, close to where I was helping with some writing and editing for Syria Today magazine. Forty-four people were killed and 166 injured. Spasmodic violence continued in the following months, making life steadily more dangerous. Then, in July, armed rebels took over some districts in the city. Fighting and shelling became a daily event and the peril ever-present. It was no longer worth the risk to remain in the city. In our three-and-a-half years in Syria, we saw the country not only from street level but also from the edges of elite circles - our daughter was at school with the son of President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma and they attended school functions like any well-to-do couple. And for two years I was able to travel extensively, from the black-stoned Roman remains in Bosra in the south, to the crumbling 5000-year-old Mesopotamian ruins at Mari on the Euphrates. I visited the Roman ruin at Palmyra, the 3700-year-old site of Ugarit and the luminescent St Simeon Cathedral ruin north of Aleppo near the Turkish border. On the other hand we knew what it was like to be shadowed by the security forces and to be surrounded by angry mobs. Many of our Syrian friends told stories of rampant bribery, cronyism, arbitrary arrest and lengthy imprisonment without trial. Yet when the Arab Spring broke out last year, Syria seemed the least likely place that would succumb. Though it was still a totalitarian state, some reform had been allowed and Bashar and Asma seemed to be popular, at least among the middle classes. All that began to change in March last year when security forces overstepped the mark by torturing a group of children caught writing anti-government graffiti. The cracks swiftly appeared in the brittle structure of the state, exposing deep divisions in the country along regional, religious, ethnic and class lines. These divisions had been hidden by a ruthless Soviet-style police state, in which all organs of government were controlled by the presidency and the security apparatus. The citizen effectively had no rights and the government no requirement for accountability. About 15 branches of the 70,000 strong security apparatus, supported by networks of informers, ensured that all political space was shut down and the media tightly controlled. Any active opposition figures were imprisoned or exiled. The secret police, the Mukhabarat, were everywhere. Young men in black leather jackets and jeans with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders frequently reminded me that I could not take photos near the multitude of security and military compounds around Damascus. Whenever I travelled out of the city, they followed in the security services' standard issue beat-up Peugeot 404s. There was no hiding the poverty in the poorer towns and the slums encircling Damascus and Aleppo. In 2010, per capita GDP was only US$5200 ($6228) and 34 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line. Unemployment was estimated at over 20 per cent, and was especially high for the young. Cronyism, corruption and nepotism were rampant throughout government. A friend of mine returned to Syria in 2009, after living outside of the country for several years. To clear her possessions from customs at the port in Lattakia, she was required to pay a bribe of US$1000. The regime controlled all government employment. Merit was not part of the process. It was \"wasta\", or patronage, that counted. Citizens were frequently arrested and detained without charge. A friend spent many years in Assad jails without charge for suspected association with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, membership of which carries the death penalty. The Assad family occupied the very top of the Syrian power pyramid, and controlled the security apparatus including the police, the military, and the Mukhabarat. Below them were layers of mostly fellow Alawite senior functionaries, supported by Christians and Sunnis who knew their only way to get ahead was to ally with the regime. The Government was essentially a huge family mafia. The Alawites, a Shia sect, make up 10 per cent of Syria's population, Christians 10 per cent, Sunnis 70 per cent, Druze two per cent, Kurds 7 per cent and others 1 per cent. On the surface the sectarian make-up of the country had little impact on daily life. Government censors would not allow reference to any sectarian group. Syria was a secular Arab nationalist state with social and religious freedom: there were no restrictions on dress and alcohol was discreetly available. But the regime ruled by fear. Its propaganda machine instilled in the population a fear of Muslim extremism, of Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, Wahabis and Al Qaeda. The aim was to ensure the support of Alawites, Christians, and Druze, and the more liberal Sunnis. In the first couple of years we were there, Syria seemed to be emerging from a long period of isolation. Relations with Turkey had improved dramatically, with free trade and visa-free agreements. The economy was also growing, if slowly at 3.4 per cent, with tourism making up for declining oil and gas revenues. Since 2005, Assad had moved, if haltingly, to reform the economy on a market-social model. Foreign investment, particularly in the banking sector, was encouraged. Despite the obvious poverty, in Damascus and Aleppo wealth was evident on the streets with luxury cars and European boutiques evidence of a growing elite. Against this background, when colleagues asked me in February 2011 - after the Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya uprisings - whether Syria might be next, I said \"very unlikely\". At that time Assad was 45 years old and his wife Asma 35. They were a popular couple. Some economic reforms had brought change, and although Assad's talk of political reform had produced no results, there was the hope that the regime would read the signs in the region and get ahead of the reform game. Importantly, unlike Tunisia and the other dictatorships in the region, the Syrian leadership was not allied to the West. Syria stood, with Iran and the Lebanese Shia militia cum political party Hizbullah, against the so-called \"Zionist-American project\" in the Middle East, a policy popular on the Arab street. Well, I was wrong. My perspective was perhaps coloured by personal experience. Zenobia spent a year in the same class as Karim al-Assad, the president's son. When I attended parent-teacher meetings, Asma, the \"first lady\", was present. Her contributions were always low-key, but it was clear she was a liberal, modern, intelligent and eloquent woman. At the end-of-year school concert Bashar and Asma came along in their jeans and leather jackets, and mingled freely with the children. This outgoing and relaxed style had endeared this couple to the country's moneyed elite and the rising middle class, if not the country at large. The regime's true colours were shown when 15 children wrote anti-government graffiti on a wall in the southern city of Dera'a in March last year. The security forces arrested them, took them to Damascus, beat and tortured them, including pulling out some fingernails. This outraged their extended families and fellow citizens who took to the streets in protest where security forces fired on the unarmed crowd, killing several people. The regime's strategy was immediately revealed - it would intimidate and bludgeon all opposition into submission using deadly force if necessary. But demonstrations spread across the country. Syria's time had come. The protests, and the regime's response, shocked everyone. After 40 years of fear, suppression, censorship and intimidation, a self-liberation took hold as citizens massed in the streets, initially shouting for democratic reforms, dignity, an end to corruption and a reigning-in of the security services. As protest spread and the crackdown intensified, the demands escalated into calls for an end to the Assad regime. The fear barrier had been broken. In April last year we saw for ourselves how the divisions in Syrian society were opening up when we travelled to Aleppo, stopping on the way to view the \"lost cities\", a cluster of AD400 Byzantine towns. At the town of Murat Al-Numan we noticed a large group of young men standing around with Syrian flag; a kilometre away was another group of 200 or 300 marching toward the town. A young Syrian pulled up and shouted in English that we must turn around, \"there was trouble\". We did so. But by then the group in town had swelled. Armed with sticks and clubs they were marching towards the other group, shouting pro-government slogans. We were caught in the middle. To our relief the angry mob let us pass through their ranks without incident. The two groups embodied the sharp divisions that were opening up in Syrian society.. The regime's propaganda response was that the violence emanated from \"armed terrorist groups\", including criminals and religious extremists, supported by foreigners. The regime staged televised \"confessions\" of young men with their weapons to validate the story, while armed thugs were recruited by the regime into the mostly Alawite \"Shabbiha\" gangs to do the more unsavoury intimidation work. The torture of protesters, mostly young, became routine. A friend of mine had one of his workers arrested. They beat and humiliated him for 10 days, then left him alone for 20 days for his wounds to heal, then released him to his family. Such stories are very common. In some cases the regime would return a mutilated corpse. Assad belatedly announced some modest political reforms as protests increased. The emergency law, invoked following the 1963 Baathist coup, was lifted. A new media law was passed. A referendum on a new constitution was held on February 26, 2012. Parliamentary elections were held on May 7, and a new government formed on June 23. However these \"reforms\" were a sham and included no input from the opposition, who boycotted the elections. The secular veneer of Syrian society began to lift as the violence intensified. The protesters and victims of state violence were overwhelmingly Sunni. They were being killed and tortured by a security apparatus which was predominantly Shia Alawite. The UN Human Rights Council appointed an independent commission on Syria which released a report last month confirming that government forces had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, torture, sexual violence, looting and destruction of property. The report also found that government forces and \"Shabbiha\" had massacred 108 civilians in Houla, a massacre the regime had blamed on \"armed terrorist groups\". The commission found opposition fighters had also committed war crimes, including murder, extrajudicial execution and torture. During the first six months of the uprising, the regime was able to mount some huge pro-government demonstrations, particularly in Damascus. These were held on weekdays so government workers and schoolchildren could be marshalled to attend. But communities of Alawis and Christians and others also willingly attended. These rallies stopped as the regime became increasingly aware its support base was shrinking. It is very difficult to assess support for the regime, but there is little doubt that it is still considerable. A Christian friend of mine remains implacably in support of Assad, but only because he fears the rule of the majority Sunnis, a rule he believes would be extremist and anti-Christian. The sharp domestic divide is mirrored at regional and international levels. Iran has been closely allied to Syria since the Assads backed them in their 1980-1988 war against Iraq. Iran is supplying both weapons and technical assistance to the Assad regime. Syria has also facilitated the supply of Iranian arms to Hizbullah, which is now the leading faction in the Lebanese government. The US-British invasion of Iraq facilitated the rise of the majority Shia to power there, and as a result Iraq too supports the Assad regime. On the other side of the regional divide Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have all called for an orderly transition and for Assad to step down. It is widely believed that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are supplying arms to anti-government rebels. The Arab League sent monitors to Syria in December last year to help negotiate a ceasefire, but they were withdrawn three months later, having been ignored by both sides. The international community is also divided. Russia and China have blocked three UN Security Council resolutions to put pressure on Assad to implement a ceasefire and engage the opposition in dialogue. Though the Security Council did agree to a joint Arab League-UN peace initiative under former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, the mission was without teeth and it failed. Annan left his post last month and the 300 strong UN Supervisory Mission in Syria, which included a small New Zealand element, was withdrawn. Lakhdar Ebrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, replaced Annan three weeks ago. He admitted that his mission is \"almost impossible\", and most analysts doubt he can conjure up the peaceful solution which eluded Annan. Too much blood has been spilled. Coinciding with Ebrahimi's appointment, Mohammad Mursi, Egypt's president, convened a regional \"Quartet\" comprising Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Quartet seems as divided as the Security Council and without a change in Iran's stance is unlikely to be in a position to pressure the Assad regime or the rebels to lay down arms and begin a dialogue. After 18 months, the Syrian uprising has claimed more than 20,000 lives according to a conservative UN estimate. More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, 2.5 million require humanitarian assistance, and more than 230,000 have fled and are registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Syrian opposition groups say 26,000 people have been detained. From the outset, Assad's regime has unswervingly followed the security solution, and government forces have resorted to artillery, tank, and more recently air bombardments including on residential areas. The regime is morphing into an Alawite militia prepared to fight it out to the bitter end, regardless of the cost to the country. Negotiation and compromise are not part of the state's lexicon. And the ranks of anti-government rebels have been growing steadily as more and more Syrians take up arms to avenge the violence against their families, villages and towns. The boldness of their attacks on government targets has increased, and regime \"insiders\" are helping them. Our lives over the past few months had become increasingly constrained by security considerations. There were several small roadside bombs targeting military vehicles exploding just a few kilometres from the house. All unnecessary travel was curtailed. However the wider dangers of this war came home to us personally in July this year when the opposition Free Syrian Army assassinated four top security officials, including Assad's brother-in-law, at a meeting in a military compound a few hundred metres from the presidential residence. In response Assad forces dramatically intensified their artillery bombardment of several districts of Damascus making life unpredictable and dangerous, and provoking an exodus of tens of thousands from Damascus across the border into Lebanon. We joined that search for safety because there were clear risks of a dramatic escalation of the conflict. We spent 10 days in Beirut waiting for a break in the fighting so we could return and pack our things. There is a high risk that the conflict will become an increasingly sectarian proxy war with, on the Assad regime's side, Shia Iran, Iraq, and Hizbullah, backed by Russia and China; and supporting the opposition, Sunni Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey backed by the US, Britain and France. This is a civil war which could last years and take countless lives. On the day we left, Zenobia and I reached the airport in time to catch one of the last Etihad flights out before the airline stopped its Damascus service. As the aircraft swung south over the parched August desert towards Abu Dhabi, my thoughts turned to the wonderful Syrians who had proudly shared their beautiful, ancient and romantic Damascus with us for three and a half years. Though many Syrian friends who had the means had already left the country, and others had escaped on study grants overseas, I was leaving most behind to face a violent and uncertain future. It seems the price Syrians will pay to achieve their freedom from a corrupt, brutal and inept dictatorship will far outweigh that paid by their awakened Arab counterparts in the region.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine, according to news.com.au. But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career. Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade. When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded. But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants. The al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father's death. According to the Lowy Institute's Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change. \"He had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\" Dr Shanahan said. But that didn't happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government. \"You can't open up free speech in a closed political system,\" he said. Asma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 - just months before he became president. From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial - the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni. As Syria's First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women's rights and education. The couple have three children. Assad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists. But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent. One of Assad's first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reforms. But the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving. Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands. A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed. The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad's Ba'ath Party holding effective power. The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied. Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013. Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria. The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province. The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate. In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad's forces. By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war. Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra. And the messy, long and complicated war isn't just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere. Quite a lot actually. By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo. By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back. More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front. The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces. Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask. Domestically he's generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments. Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him. Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response. Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries. But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war. Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey. But millions of others have suffered. Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.

Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey. \"Iraqis have remained neutral with their support of Assad.\" Dr Shanahan said. \"Jordanians just wish it would all go away and Lebanon have always had a funny stance with Syria. \"The Gulf states oppose Assad.\" Dr Shanahan said the Gulf States have been pressuring Assad to step down for years and that hasn't worked. However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story. \"The US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don't see this situation changing anytime soon,\" he said."}{"head": " Six basic questions about the war in Syria  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " The Syrian war has been a slowly unfolding catastrophe, one that has embroiled nearly the whole world.

In March 2011, peaceful protests broke out around the country as part of the Arab Spring uprisings. Organizers called on Syrian President Bashar Assad to make democratic reforms, but his government responded with violence. In response, some of the protesters teamed up with military defectors to form the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group that wanted to overthrow the government. By 2012, this armed struggle had devolved into a full-blown civil war. Russia has long supported Assad's government. According to one scholar, Russia helped build the modern Syrian military, and Assad is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strongest allies in the Middle East. Russia has often blocked meaningful international action on Syria by vetoing proposals at the U.N. Security Council, and Moscow changed the course of the war in Assad's favor with a military intervention in 2015. The United States has been reluctant to become too entangled in Syria, but it has acted for two main reasons. First, the Islamic State began developing a foothold in the country in 2013. The next year, the United States launched airstrikes against the militant group. It eventually sent ground troops into the fight, and about 2,000 U.S. forces are now deployed there. Second, the United States has acted to punish the Assad government for using chemical weapons such as sarin and chlorine gas on Syrian civilians. In 2012, President Barack Obama called the use of chemical weapons a \"red line\" that would prompt military intervention. The following year, a sarin gas attack in Eastern Ghouta killed about 1,400 people, according to the U.S. government's assessment. Obama pushed for a strike but couldn't get congressional approval. Instead, he came up with a diplomatic solution. The U.N. Security Council ordered Assad to destroy his chemical weapons stockpile and sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits countries from producing, stockpiling or using chemical weapons. There have been several reports of chemical weapons attacks since then. One particularly bad strike took place April 4, 2017. Nearly 100 people were killed in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun in an apparent sarin attack. It garnered worldwide headlines and the attention of President Trump, who expressed horror at the images of \"innocent children, innocent babies\" poisoned by a nerve agent. Just a few days after that attack, Trump authorized a cruise-missile strike on a Syrian air base. It was the first direct U.S. strike on the Syrian regime in the war. One of Assad's key allies is Iran. Iran needs Syria to move its weapons and proxy militias across the Middle East. So when Assad seemed threatened, Iran stepped in to support him. So did Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militia that is a close ally of Tehran. That upset Iran's rivals in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. So they began sending arms and money to anti-Assad rebels, including extremist militias. Israel's begun attacking Assad bases with airstrikes. That means that today, there are many wars being fought inside Syria. The Syrian government is still at war with the rebels. Israel is at war with Iranian-backed forces. And the United States is trying to kill off the Islamic State. Horrible. Syrian families often don't have basic necessities, like food, shelter and medical care. Children can't go to school. The war is being fought in towns and on the streets. Since the start of the war, more than 465,000 Syrians have been killed, 1 million more have been injured, and 12 million - more than half the country's population - have been forced to flee their homes. More than 5.5 million have moved abroad and registered as refugees."}{"head": " The Syria strikes: What do they achieve and what's next?

The US President has frequently disputed that his election opponent won more votes than he did and his predecessor drew a bigger inauguration crowd. He has taken time out from the biggest job on the planet to feud on Twitter with Arnold Schwarzenegger over ratings for The Apprentice. During a speech to Congress, his idea of offering comfort to a dead Navy Seal's widow after she received a standing ovation was to say her husband was \"very happy, because I think he just broke a record\". So, weeks of job approval ratings, chronically low for a new US president, must have been hard to stomach. Gallup figures showing Trump at 37 and 38 per cent approval have been widely shared among politicos on the President's social media of choice, Twitter. And polls showed sliding support among groups of voters for Trump and his policies. When combined with daily doses of bad news about the Russia investigation, stalled healthcare reform, legal blocks to immigration moves, insider leaking and Trump Administration chaos, it was clear change was required. Unpopularity makes it harder for a president to push through programmes and easier for opponents to obstruct. The story of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, illustrated in ever-widening web lines in graphics, has become the President's own email server saga millstone. What could shift it? On Friday, as US cruise missiles punched holes in hangars on the Syria regime's Shayrat base, a widely-shared Trump tweet from October 9, 2012 hinted at a possible parallel playing out: \"Now that Obama's poll numbers are in tailspin - watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.\" Trump's cruise missile strikes days after an apparent chemical weapons attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun need to be seen in the context of his domestic political woes and his background on the Syrian civil war. Eleven weeks into his presidency, Trump is attempting a reset, trying to boost his popularity and control the agenda. He wants to change the conversation from the Russia probe and the allegation he is President Vladimir Putin's puppet. The strikes are part of it, so is generally creating a perception of 'winning', being decisive, being taken more seriously, presenting messages more competently and having the right advisers. So far, in the past few days, it is working. REACTION TO THE RETALIATION Although the speed of the retaliation was a surprise, the action wasn't to pundits who have seen it all before from previous leaders. Harvard professor Stephen Walt tweeted on Thursday: \"I don't know what Trump will do re Syria. But I'm betting it will be some loud, well-publicised, and strategically meaningless airstrikes.\" With the missile strikes, Trump has had the best couple of days of his presidency. On the face of it, he has taken unusually quick, decisive action on an issue that gives him a chance to show empathy and people generally agree on. The taboo on chemcal weapons is worth upholding, right? Both the Washington establishment and mainstream US media have largely been sympathetic. A poll boost is sure to follow. Foreign leaders have expressed support. His former opponent Hillary Clinton in an interview on Friday called for strikes against Syrian airfields. The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \"the era of American passivity is over\". Democrat leader in the House Nancy Pelosi called Trump's strikes a \"proportional response\". Former Obama Administration ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, called them \"correct and well executed\". The New York Times and Guardian ran story-behind-the-story articles which bolstered Trump's assertion that he was spurred into action by footage of Syria's suffering people and depicted him as a man of action. The New York Times: \"Trump was already shaken by photos his staff had shown him of children dying ... so the President did not need a lot of convincing ... aides say the images from Syria - especially those showing the suffering of small children and babies - weigh on him ... The first public evidence of the President's concern about the chemical attack comes ... Trump says his horror at the images of 'innocent children, innocent babies' choked by poison gas in the attack has led him to reassess his approach to Syria.\" The Guardian: \"The images had a profound effect on the US President ... 'I will tell you that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me - big impact,' Trump told reporters ... Trump had criticised Obama for vacillation and weakness. Would he act differently? Within 24 hours Trump's flexibility had translated into direct action ... After weeks in which his Administration had seemed consumed by leaks, in fighting, drift and ineptitude, Trump was moving at speed.\" CNN ran a report with the extremely Trump-friendly headline: \"These are the images that moved President Trump to act in Syria\". Daily Beast and CNN commentator Matt Lewis tweeted: \"Trump can punish Assad, deter future use of chemical weapons, send a message to the world, & still avoid the mess of regime change.\" Presenter with Britain's Channel 4 Matt Frei tweeted: \"With Syria strikes @realDonaldTrump showed 1he can act decisively 2not Russia's puppet 3not Obama 4has humanitarian reflex5 unpredictable.\" As MSNBC host Chris Hayes noted: \"Tonight Trump is getting praise from the very same Establishment he ran against and whose approval he desperately seeks.\" The circumstances surrounding the President's crisis point were significant.Trump dealt with the Syria issue while hosting the Chinese President Xi Jinping. He received a major Congressional victory with the Senate confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. And various reports emerged of a staff shake-up, with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Stephen Bannon said to be in trouble. The staffing reports had Trump ordering his aides to sort it out. The message being, man in charge is putting that infighting behind him. TRUMP'S BIG U-TURN ON SYRIA According to the Daily Beast, there had been nine previous suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria this year, with toxic chlorine gas, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Trump Administration had shown no previous desire to take retalitory action. And what about deaths caused by conventional weapons? Remember the agonising fall of Aleppo late last year? Trump's team has been trying hard to get a ban on Syrian refugees - fleeing their brutal dictator - from entering the US. Before he became president, Trump said numerous times in 2013 and 2014 that the US should not bomb Syria. In 2013 former President Barack Obama declared chemical weapon use a red line and then backed down from taking military action in the face of popular and Congressional opposition. In August 2013, chemical weapons were used against people in Ghouta, killing about 1300. Trump tweeted: \"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long-term conflict?\" And: \"President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your 'powder' for another (and more important) day!\" Acting on the latest atrocity - thought to involve sarin gas - gave Trump a chance to shape up in comparison to Obama. Yesterday, press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a photo of Trump and team at a briefing in what was clearly meant to mirror the famous picture of Obama and officials during the Osama bin Laden raid. Washington Post blogger Paul Waldman tweeted: \"In these foreign policy crises, almost impossible to overestimate the role Trump's desire 2B tougher than Obama will play in his decisions\". Trump called it a \"targeted\" strike \"on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread of chemical weapons\". Syria denies using nerve gas. Trump's speech sounded very much like something George W. Bush could have delivered. \"My fellow Americans\", \"no child of God\", \"end the slaughter\", \"we pray for God's wisdom\", \"America stands for justice\". The only Trumpian note in it was \"beautiful babies\". Trump's sudden concern for Syrians is problematic whether taken at face value or not. Firstly, it is a convenient phenomenon that we can only take his word for. Secondly, it only seems to apply to Syrians killed by chemical weapons. Thirdly, it goes against his background statements and actions towards Syrian refugees. Fourthly, is it a good thing that the President can suddenly change course based on an emotional, gut reaction? Also, as Micah Zenko of the Council of Foreign Relations tweeted: \"That Trump was moved by graphic images to OK the attack won't be lost on all threatened groups seeking US intervention on their behalf.\" WHAT DID THE STRIKES ACHIEVE? For many people hoping for progress in ending the Syrian civil war, none of that will matter. The war is a gaping wound in the world which has destabilised the region and wider Europe. It is a complex conflict seemingly without end that has left people for years looking on feeling frustrated and helpless, or angry at the displaced millions. In reactions to the US strikes, a lot of people commenting on media and social media seemed to be uploading their own emotional projections about the war onto Trump's actions. Some people saw it as appropriate, limited, punishment for the Khan Sheikhoun attack. There was relief from Syrians that the Assad regime had finally taken a hit from the US. Perhaps more would follow. Long-time Syria watchers believed it was strategically good that Trump had demonstrated that military force was on the table. Obama's unwillingness to battle Bashar al-Assad as well as Isis had been seen as prolonging the war. Perhaps this has opened the door to intervention against the regime after the quarantined approach. Some saw Trump as refilling the Rubicon to deter future use of chemical weapons.Other people focused on whether the strikes were legal, or whether they sent a wider warning to North Korea and China, or whether the US was just repeating ineffective history. Some right-wing supporters of Trump were disappointed that he was not the isolationist they had believed in. It was quickly clear that the strikes were limited in scope and largely symbolic: A mini shock and awe. By Friday night NZT Reuters and AFP were reporting that planes were already using the base to take off on bombing raids in the countryside. By yesterday Khan Sheikhoun was being bombed again. Reports quickly surfaced on Friday from the BBC and ABC that Russians and Syrians were evacuated from the airbase before the strike. The Pentagon confirmed that Russia was notified in advance. Al Jazeera America producer Tony Karon tweeted: \"For anyone who thinks this is start of a war to topple Assad, note the care taken to minimise risk to his forces at target site\". Moscow has promised to strengthen Syria's anti-aircraft defences. It is also suspending a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their planes in Syria. Today Russia sent a warship to boost its battlegroup off the Syrian coast. Considering how both Trump and Putin would benefit from more perceived independence from each other, just how coordinated were the strikes? It is impossible to know just yet. Eurasia Group political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted: \"Assad gas attack vigorously denied by Kremlin & makes Putin looks weak v Assad (Iran matters..). US-Russia heading for trouble\". Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland smells a scam. \"How convenient that Trump, under fire for being Vladimir Putin's poodle, now stands up to him in Syria. How neatly this blows away all those allegations of secret links and election hacking. Yes, there have been ample statements of condemnation from Moscow, but those don't cost either side anything. The US appears to have given Russia sufficient warning to ensure their men weren't hit, and Russia used none of its ample capacity to hit back. It all worked out very nicely.\" HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO THEY CARRY? There has been a lot of debate on how much weight these strikes carry. If it is too obviously organised military theatre then can it really enforce a warning to the Syrian regime? Is Trump almost guaranteed to have to go further at some stage? And should Trump suddenly be seen as a 'strong' leader, having dropped 59 cruise missiles worth US$59 million, after decades of war. Zenko tweeted: \"US dropped 26,172 bombs in 2016. How does 59 more suddenly demonstrate US 'resolve,' 'credibility,' + 'leadership?'\" New York Times journalist Max Fisher wrote in a series of tweets: \"Still confused by argument that the US established anti-CW deterrence by demonstrating it will retaliate with negligibly damaging strikes. If this was executed competently and Russia given warnings, then strikes appear largely symbolic. Little impact on regime or its calculus. How exactly did these US strikes establish deterrence? Is this 'punishment' sufficient to change anything?\" Josh Barro of Business Insider asked: \"If you openly signal that the attack was symbolic, doesn't that undermine the symbolism?\" Naval War College professor Tom Nichols tweeted: \"This looks like a pinprick. It pops the balloon of thinking Syria is untouchable, but whether it deters anything is less clear.\" Former US Treasury terror finance analyst Jonathan Schanzer tweeted: \"FWIW, I think a limited, proportional response is a good first move. Doesn't solve Syria, but lets Assad/Iran know we are watching.\" Clifford May of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies tweeted: \"Also let's Russia know we're back in the game. N Korea, too, can no longer bank on US inaction, 'soft power' and talking as only responses.\" WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? For many experts the 'what's next' question is key. University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami tweeted: \"Within days, Trump's strike will look more and more ineffective, forcing a decision: escalate or live with perception of failure.\" Writer Max Boot tweeted: \"Now what? Is message that US will tolerate Assad as long as he doesn't use CW? Or is this prelude to larger strategy in Syria? If so what?\" Former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said that \"Trump biggest worry now; what if Assad defies him and uses chemical weapons again?\" Head of Foreign Policy Group, David Rothkopf, tweeted: \"Problem re: Trump & mil action is - he's impulsive and not strategic. Taking such action absent clear policies is where biggest risks arise. The 'what's next' component of Syria strike will reveal much about effectiveness & thinking of Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster, Pompeo team.\" Zenko said a 'rosy scenario' could see Assad deterred without the US being drawn further into the civil war. But he said \"I looked at 36 cases of limited US strikes: They achieve military goals 1/2 the time; political goals less than 10%.\" A Middle East veteran writer, Sam Dagher, tweeted: \"Without plan to remove Assad from power US strikes strengthen him as leader confronting Trump aggression.\" The editor of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, compared the President with his predecessor: \"Obama was known for an overly cerebral commitment to the notion of strategic patience. Trump seems more committed to a policy of glandular, non-strategic impatience. Obama may have been paralysed by a phobic reaction to the threat posed by the slippery slope. Donald Trump now finds himself dancing at the edge of the slippery slope his predecessor so assiduously avoided.\""}{"head": " NZ to give another $1m to Syrians affected by war  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " New Zealand will provide an additional $1 million to help Syrians affected by their country's brutal civil war, including those in Aleppo.

The Syrian government took full control of Aleppo on Thursday for the first time in four years after the last opposition fighters and civilians were bussed out of war-ravaged eastern districts, sealing the end of the rebellion's most important stronghold. The evacuations ended a brutal chapter in Syria's nearly six-year civil war, allowing President Bashar Assad to regain full authority over the country's largest city and former commercial powerhouse. It marked his most significant victory since an uprising against his family's four-decade rule began in 2011. Under a deal brokered by Russia and Turkey, tens of thousands of residents and fighters began evacuating to opposition-controlled areas in the surrounding countryside, a process that took a week. More than 35,000 fighters and civilians were bussed out, according to the United Nations.

Last weekend, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated, publicly, that the U.S. would no longer push for Syrian President Bashar Assad to be removed from power. On Tuesday, Assad forces allegedly attacked a town in Idlib province with sarin gas, killing 80. By Friday, the Trump administration was bombing a Syrian airbase and threatening a coalition-led effort to oust the embattled Syrian leader. Here are seven key points for understanding this dramatic shift in policy: Q. Why would Assad use chemical weapons in the first place? Didn't he know that he would provoke the United States to intervene?A. In short: He's running out of options. As Andrew J. Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy explained, Assad has just 18,000 deployable forces and his government controls only a third of the country. That means his army is stretched very thin. Additionally, he's being pressured by the Russians to go on the offensive. They especially want him to press eastward, so that if/when Raqqa falls out of the hands of the Islamic State, his army will be there to pick up the pieces. \"He's stretched his forces too thin,\" Tabler told me. \"And he's begun losing ground\" in the area where the sarin attack was perpetrated Tuesday. Assad doesn't have the forces he needs to retake that region, so he turned to his stash of chemical weapons. And although chemical weapons have provoked a strong international outcry in the past, Assad probably thought he could get away with it. He probably thought that, Tabler says, because that's what Putin told him. As Tabler explains, U.S. officials say there were Russian soldiers at the air base from which the sarin attack was allegedly launched. \"I think Assad and the Russians thought they had carte blanche,\" Tabler says. \"They were wrong. \" Q. Why did the United States decide to attack after staying out of the conflict for six years?A. It's hard to puzzle out exactly what changed for the Trump administration, which has disavowed military intervention in the Middle East on several occasions. Just this week, Tillerson told reporters that removing Assad was not a priority. He was echoing comments made by United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and even White House press secretary Sean Spicer. They made these statements knowing that Assad had used chemical weapons at least three times since 2013, when a sarin gas attack killed more than 1,000 people. But if you listen to the president, it had everything to do with the pictures. On Tuesday, 80 people were killed by a sarin attack perpetrated by the Assad government. (Assad's government disputes that charge.) On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he'd been deeply affected by the pictures coming out of Idlib province. The images showed, in Trump's words, \"beautiful little babies\" lying dead on the ground, suffocated by a chemical agent. Trump called the attack an \"affront to humanity.\" By Thursday, he was saying that \"something should happen\" to Assad because of his responsibility for the attack. Q. What did the United States target Syria's Shayrat air base? And what did the attacks really accomplish? A. Thursday night, the U.S. military launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield. Why'd they choose the airfield, and not, say, one of the places where Assad's chemical weapons are stored? That's pretty easy: Shayrat, in Homs province, is the base that apparently launched the chemical attack in Idlib. The U.S. missiles targeted air defenses, aircraft, hangars and fuel storage sites. The U.S. military said initial indications were that the strike had \"severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure,\" though that's hard to independently verify. Syrian officials say the strikes also killed seven people, including four children. Nine others were wounded, according to state media reports. As one local told the BBC, the blasts from the strike were \"massive.\" He thinks civilians living nearby could well have been killed. Q. Iran and Russia condemned the attack. What do they stand to lose?A. The war in Syria is a civil war, but it's also a proxy war, being fought by many, many, many other countries. And the places with the most to lose if Assad falls? Russia and Iran. Moscow is Assad's key international ally, and has provided the Syrian leader with unconditional diplomatic backing. Since September, Russia has provided direct military support as well. Experts say it's conducted more than 500 airstrikes against rebel-held forces. Russia's motivations are myriad -- involvement in Syria makes the country a major player in the Middle East, and protects Russia's only Mediterranean military base. It also gives Russia a way to play international peacekeeper. Iran, too, has more than 2,000 troops bolstering the Syrian army, though Tehran publicly denies being involved. Iran's motivation for helping Assad are also wrapped up in its regional ambitions. Iran is the Middle East's most powerful Shiite state, and it looks to bolster other Shiite regimes, like Assad's government. Iran is also deeply concerned about the rise of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, Sunni terrorist groups that have targeted Shiite Muslims in the past. \"If Syria falls, Iran will have to fight these groups within its borders,\" an expert told Al Jazeera in 2016. Q. Why didn't President Barack Obama do something similar after Assad used sarin on civilians in 2013? A. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama was confronted with a similar choice. A sarin attack on the outskirts of Damascus killed more than 1,000 people, including 400 children. The Assad government was allegedly to blame. And Obama had already drawn a \"red line,\" promising to attack if chemical weapons were deployed. After the Ghouta assault, the president considered a targeted military response. But Congress was unwilling to authorize the strike. So instead, the president sought out diplomatic alternatives. With an assist from Russia, he made progress -- at the end of 2013, Assad agreed to destroy his country's massive stockpile of chemical weapons and also agreed to United Nations monitoring. By June 2014, he had largely complied. In truth, though, Obama was always deeply reluctant to intervene in Syria, concerned about getting the U.S. entangled in another intractable war As the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg explained: \"In 2013, Obama feared, not without justification, the second- and third-order consequences of an American missile strike on the regime. Even before he became president, Obama worried greatly about slippery slopes in the Middle East. In Syria, he understood that Assad would most likely survive an American missile strike on his airbases; the day after such strikes ended, Assad, Obama believed, would have emerged from his hiding place, and declared victory: The greatest power in the world tried to destroy him, and failed. Obama was acutely aware that a one-off strike (a theoretical strike described as 'unbelievably small' by his secretary of state, John Kerry), could possibly have served as a convincing brush-back pitch, but he was also aware that such a limited strike could have been wholly ineffectual, and even counterproductive. Assad and his allies, understanding that the appetite of average Americans for yet another Middle Eastern war was limited, could have tried to provoke Obama into escalation. An all-out war against the Syrian regime would have been, in many ways, Obama's Iraq. And Obama wasn't interested in having his own Iraq.\" Even in 2016, Obama told Goldberg that he was \"very proud of this moment.\" Q. Aren't U.S. forces already already bombing targets in Syria?A. Yup. In 2014, the United States began a military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. U.S. planes have bombed hundreds of targets over the past two years. There are also hundreds of U.S. troops on the ground near Raqqa, helping rebel groups prepare an offensive on the city, which is controlled by the Islamic State. Some experts are warning that Trump's attacks will make America's assault on the Islamic State harder. As Andrew Exum wrote in the Atlantic: \"For the past two years, U.S. and coalition aircraft have flown in and around one of the world's more robust air defense systems without the Syrian regime harassing the pilots. We had a few incidents where Russian jets got too close to U.S. aircraft or Syrian anti-aircraft radar lit up U.S. or coalition aircraft, but for the most part, the air war has gone forward unimpeded. \"Both Russia and the Syrian regime, though, are still well-positioned to play the spoiler. They can affect the flights of U.S. aircraft in eastern Syria by activating their air defenses and have, in recent months, brought in more advanced air-defense weaponry that has even the Israelis nervous. They've also 'accidentally' struck U.S.-backed rebel groups fighting the Islamic State.\" Putin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov said the strikes represent a \"significant blow\" to American-Russian ties. Friday morning, Russia said that it was suspending its pact with Washington to share information about warplane missions over Syria. The pact had protected U.S.-led coalition forces waging airstrikes against Islamic State targets within the country. Q. Is this attack a big deal? Could it escalate into some kind of horrible America/Russia World War III situation? A. Honestly, probably not. Thursday night's strike does not change the reality on the ground in Syria. It does not greatly impact Assad's military capabilities. It won't lead to any kind of regime change, at least not without a significantly broader U.S. military intervention. It probably also won't hurt America's (admittedly frosty) relationship with Russia in the long term. Sure, Russian officials blustered this morning. But behind the scenes, the country seemed willing to give the administration a pass, particularly because the U.S. made sure no Russians were hurt. What's scary - really, truly scary - is what this says about Trump's temperament. Earlier this week, Tillerson, Haley and Spicer all offered some variation on a theme: Assad would, and should, stay in power. Ousting him was not a U.S. priority. That seemed to jive with Trump's own statements during the campaign, when he called the Iraq war stupid and promised not to get entangled in the Middle East. (It also contradicts Trumps 2013 position. After the sarin attack in Ghotta, Trump wrote: AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING! Here are 17 other times he's made a similar claim.) Now, just four days later, the Trump administration has done a 180. What's changed? The president saw some really upsetting pictures on television, and felt moved to act. Having a change of heart is not the same thing as having a plan, however. Syria's civil war is one of the most complicated foreign policy problems in the world. A dozen countries are now embroiled in the outcome. And if Assad goes, it's not clear what comes next. Best-case scenario: Syria is Iraq. Worst case, it's Yemen: violent, fractured, and fertile ground for terrorists. There's no evidence that Trump has grappled, in the past few days, with what the Syrian people need, and what the United States can and should invest. At a news conference Thursday, he offered this assessment: \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity. He's there and I guess he's running things, so something should happen.\" As long as America's Syria strategy is that \"something should happen,\" Syrian children (and adults) will keep dying in horrible, brutal, utterly inhumane ways. Assad will stay in power, and he'll keep killing his people with impunity. Russia and Iran will continue their proxy wars while terror cells consolidate power. In other words: Syria was a mess yesterday. It's a mess today. It'll be a mess tomorrow, too. And Trump can do very little to change that reality."}{"head": " The Latest: UN says civil war has cost Syria $388B in damage  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Latest on developments in Syria (all times local): 8:20 p.m. A United Nations agency says Syria's seven-year-long civil war has cost the country $388 billion in economic damage.

President Bashar Assad's forces continue to press their battles against rebels and Islamic State group insurgents in pockets around northwest and south Syria while refusing a U.N.-mediated political settlement to end the war. ___ 2:20 p.m. Syrian activists say military helicopters have dropped leaflets over parts of the northwestern rebel-held province of Idlib, calling on residents to reconcile with the government. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights posted a copy of the leaflets. They say the Syrian war \"is close to an end,\" that it's time to stop the bloodletting and that residents should join reconciliation \"as our people did in other parts of Syria.\" Activists say simultaneously as the helicopters dropped leaflets on Thursday, warplanes pounded several rebel-held areas elsewhere in Idlib, which has become home to tens of thousands of internally displaced people. Idlib is the last left major rebel-held region in Syria and there are concerns that a government offensive would displace hundreds of thousands of people inside the province bordering Turkey."}{"head": " Assad says West is fueling Syria war, hoping to topple him  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview published Sunday that the West is fueling the devastating war in his country, now in its eighth year, with the aim of toppling him. Assad told The Mail on Sunday that Western nations have lied about chemical attacks in Syria and supported terrorists groups there, while Russia has supported his government against the foreign \"invasion.\" Assad reiterated his long-held position that the uprising against his rule was part of a plot to remove a leader that did not go along with Western policies in the region. Syria is allied with Iran and Russia, and has had turbulent relations with the West. Syria is technically at war with Israel, which occupies the Syrian Golan Heights, but a cease-fire has largely held since the 1970s. \"The whole approach toward Syria in the West is, 'we have to change this government; we have to demonize this president, because they don't suit our policies anymore.'\" Assad said. \"They tell lies, they talk about chemical weapons. They talk about the bad president killing good people, freedom and peaceful demonstrations.\" Syria's conflict began in 2011 with peaceful protests against the Assad family's decades-long rule. The government's violent response to the protests, and the eventual rise of an armed insurgency, tipped the country into a civil war that has claimed nearly half a million lives. Since then, Western nations and independent experts have accused the government of carrying out several chemical weapons attacks, most recently in April, in an attack near Damascus that reportedly killed dozens of people and prompted Western airstrikes. The government has denied ever using chemical weapons. Assad also dismissed reports that Israel has conducted recent airstrikes in Syria with tacit Russian cooperation. Russia has provided crucial military support to Assad's forces, waging an air campaign since 2015 that turned the tide of the war in Assad's favor. Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group have also provided extensive military support. \"Russia never coordinated with anyone against Syria, either politically or militarily,\" Assad said. \"How could they help the Syrian Army advancing and at the same time work with our enemies in order to destroy our army?\" Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes against Iranian forces in Syria last month. The lack of any Russian response, despite the heavy Russian presence in the skies over Syria, suggested that Moscow might have been notified ahead of time. Assad said he has remained in office through more than seven years of war because he has \"public support.\" \"We are fighting the terrorists, and those terrorists are supported by the British government, the French government, the Americans and their puppets whether in Europe or in our region,\" he said. \"We are fighting them, and we have public support in Syria to fight those terrorists. That's why we are advancing. We cannot make these advances just because we have Russian and Iranian support.\" In recent weeks, the Syrian government and its allies have made considerable military gains, including bringing the entire capital and its suburbs under full government control for the first time since the war began. Some areas in the north are controlled by the Turkish military and its Syrian allies and others in the northeast are run by U.S.-backed Syrian forces. Rebel fighters remain in control of most of Idlib province in the northwest and parts of southern Syria. On Sunday, activists and a war monitor said at least 10 people were killed in airstrikes in Taftanaz, a town in northeastern Idlib province. The Syrian Civil Defense, known as White Helmets, said the killed included four children and one woman and that those killed were all at the local pediatric hospital that got hit in the airstrike. The Observatory and an activist-run media center in Taftanaz said the hospital was put out of order struck. At least five others were killed in the nearby towns of Binnish, Ariha and Ram Hemdan, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights."}{"head": " NZ's blunt message to Russia on Syria: 'Your support is destroying innocent lives'  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " New Zealand has demanded that Syria stop the bombing its own civilians - telling the U.N.

The strong condemnation was made at an emergency meeting called to discuss worsening violence in Syria and as government planes bomb the city of Aleppo. And it comes as Prime Minister John Key says Russian president Vladimir Putin's ego is driving much of his country's policy on the conflict. The United States has accused Russia of \"barbarism\", and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it may have committed war crimes. VIDEO: John Key: Syrian President has got to go A ceasefire between the Syrian Government and rebel forces collapsed last week when an aid convoy was bombed. Fighting has since intensified in Aleppo, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped. The Syrian airforce push to capture the rebel-controlled areas of the city has Russian and Iranian support and there are reports of thousands of civilian casualties. New Zealand's Acting Ambassador Carolyn Schwalger chaired the Security Council emergency meeting and told members New Zealand \"demands that the Syrian Government immediately cease its bombing of civilians and demonstrate genuine commitment to achieving a negotiated peace\". All countries but particularly those with most influence over the Syrian Government should do the same, Schwalger said in the unusually blunt statement. \"I speak in particular to those whose political and material support is making the Syrian Government's current actions possible. \"Your support is undermining any remaining prospects for the peace process. And it is destroying innocent lives under the guise of countering terrorism.\" Syria needed to ground its planes and hold back its armies. \"New Zealand appeals to the governments of Russia and Iran - if you are serious about peace, do everything in your power in the coming days to halt the fighting and give the US-Russia arrangements a chance.\" Russia has blamed the ceasefire breakdown on the rebel forces, including those backed by the West, and says some groups in eastern Aleppo are holding the local population hostage and using them as human shields. Schwalger said New Zealand recognised that those opposed to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad also had responsibilities, and countries with influence on the opposition needing to encourage respect for the ceasefire and the disassociation with terrorist groups. \"However, what the Syrian Government and its allies are doing is making that disassociation harder and prolonging the war. \"All involved in Syria need to take a hard look at themselves and ask whether they intend to be genuine collaborators in the search for peace.\" It is New Zealand's turn to hold the Presidency of the Security Council this month and Prime Minister John Key is back in the country after travelling to New York where he chaired a heated Security Council debate on the Syria crisis. Schwalger referenced Key's statement, saying Security Council members in response agreed points including that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict, and the urgent need to stop the fighting. \"It is therefore with utter dismay that we find ourselves back in this Chamber as Syrian planes, reportedly with Russian support, inflict carnage on eastern Aleppo. \"These actions, reportedly including the use of incendiary and other indiscriminate weapons, are disturbing and demonstrate total disregard for their devastating impact on civilians.\" This morning, Key told Newstalk ZB the Syrian crisis was \"deeply frustrating\". \"You go back to 2010 people were holidaying there. Now you have half the entire population displaced, hundreds of people losing their lives, those scenes you see on your nightly tv screens of beautiful little children dying.\" Key said he believed the Russians did want a ceasefire but for different reasons to the West. \"A lot of it comes down to, A, backing their man Assad, B, proving they stand by their man Assad, but maybe the main thing is [Russian president] Vladimir Putin's ego - he wants to say, 'You want to get resolutions to issues, I'm your guy and come to Moscow.\" There was \"no long-term place for Assad\" as Syrian leader, Key said, but there would have to be a transition period if Russia was to support his ousting. \"This is a guy who has used chemical weapons against his own people, amongst everything else. He has to go.\" Save the Children has cited reports that about half of recent casualties in Aleppo were children."}{"head": "\nNew strikes pound Syria\u2019s Ghouta after alleged gas attack\n", "classes": [], "content": "\nSmoke billows in the town of Douma, the last opposition holdout in Syria\u2019s Eastern Ghouta, on April 7, 2018, after Syrian regime troops resumed a military blitz to pressure rebels to withdraw. \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Fresh air strikes hit rebel-held areas of Syria\u2019s Eastern Ghouta on April 8, a monitor said, after more than 80 people were killed in weekend raids including an alleged chemical attack denounced by the United States and Pope Francis.The April 8 strikes came despite reports of a ceasefire and the potential resumption of talks between Syria\u2019s regime and Jaish al-Islam, the last rebel faction in Ghouta.Allegations of a chlorine gas attack on April 7 were causing widespread international concern, but Syrian state media and regime ally Russia denounced the claims as \u201cfabrications\u201d.Assad\u2019s forces renewed their assault on Douma, the last rebel-controlled town in Eastern Ghouta, on April 6 after talks over an evacuation of Jaish al-Islam fighters broke down.The regime has used a fierce military onslaught and two negotiated withdrawals to retake control of 95% of Eastern Ghouta, once the main rebel stronghold close to Damascus.It appeared last week that Douma would follow suit, with the evacuation of hundreds of rebels and their families, but there were reports of divisions among the rebels with hardliners refusing to go.At least 80 civilians have been killed since April 6 after the regime launched fresh air raids, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor.The Observatory also reported that dozens of people had suffered breathing problems following the attacks, but could not identify the cause.The White Helmets, who act as first responders in rebel-held areas of Syria, alleged that regime forces had used \u201cpoisonous chlorine gas\u201d in the attacks. Footage posted by the group online, which was not possible to verify, showed victims including children foaming at the mouth. There were conflicting reports on the number of dead in the alleged gas attack, with the White Helmets reporting between 40 and 70 killed.The Observatory said that 11 of those who died at the weekend, including four children, had suffered breathing problems after the raids. \u201cThese reports, if confirmed, are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community,\u201d U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. \u201cThe Assad regime and its backers must be held accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cRussia, with its unwavering support for the regime, ultimately bears responsibility for these brutal attacks.\u201dPope Francis too have condemned the suspected attack. \u201cTerrible news comes to us from Syria with dozens of victims, many of them women and children... so many people are struck by the effects of the chemical substances in the bombs,\u201d the Pope told thousands of people gathered in St Peter's Square on April 8.The Syrian regime has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons, with the United Nations among those blaming government forces for a deadly sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun in April 2017.That attack prompted Washington to launch military strikes against a regime military base.Major General Yuri Yevtushenko, head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of the Warring Sides in Syria, denied the claims. \u201cWe are ready, once Douma is freed from militants, to immediately send Russian specialists in radiation, chemical and biological defence to collect data that will confirm these claims are fabricated,\u201d he said in comments reported by Russian news agencies.On the morning of April 8, a civilian committee taking part in the talks between the rebels and Russia announced \u201ca ceasefire and the resumption of talks today\u201d hoping it will lead to a \u201cfinal accord\u201d.State news agency SANA also reported that talks would begin within several hours.Mr. Assad is keen to recapture Ghouta to eliminate the opposition from the outskirts of Damascus and end years of rocket fire on the capital. Since February 18, the regime\u2019s Ghouta offensive has killed more than 1,600 civilians and sliced the area into three isolated pockets, each held by different rebel factions.The first two were evacuated under Russian-brokered deals that saw more than 46,000 rebels and civilians bussed to opposition-held Idlib Province in the northwest. Tens of thousands also fled into government-controlled territory through safe passages opened by Russia and Syrian troops.Moscow also stepped in to negotiate a deal for Douma, the third and final pocket where Jaish al-Islam had been angling for a reconciliation agreement that would allow its members to remain as a police force.Following a preliminary accord announced by Russia on April 1, nearly 3,000 fighters and civilians were evacuated from Douma to northern Syria. But as talks dragged on, Syria and Russia threatened Jaish al-Islam with a renewed military assault if the group did not agree to withdraw.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:57:43 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-air-strikes-hit-last-rebel-stronghold-of-douma-syria-civil-war-monitor/article23471554.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nThe many conflicts in Syria ", "classes": [], "content": "Last year, after the regime forces made advances against the rebels, and the Islamic State was defeated, the Syrian civil war seemed to be winding down. However, the crisis is escalating with the regime beginning a new phase of the war in Idlib province, which is controlled by rebels and al-Qaeda-linked jihadists; Turkey sending troops across the border to fight the Kurdish rebels; and the U.S. seemingly determined to stay in Syria for a longer term. Like the first phase of the civil war, this phase is also multidirectional. The regime, backed by Iran and Russia, is fighting against the rebels and jihadists in Idlib, Eastern Ghouta, and some southern enclaves. Turkish proxies, backed by the air force, are attacking Kurdish militias in Afrin, a border town. The U.S., despite Turkey\u2019s warnings, continues to support the Kurdish militias in several other towns in the border region.The downing of an Israeli fighter jet in Syria last week triggered this question once again. From the early phase of the civil war, Israel has been a passive player. In the initial stages, it backed rebels on the Golan side to create a buffer between the Golan Heights that have been occupied by Israel since 1967 and the Syrian mainland. With Iran and Hezbollah expanding their presence in Syria, Israel\u2019s focus broadened to curtail their influence. Last week, an Israeli fighter jet was carrying out a raid against an Iranian drone control facility in Syrian deserts when it came under Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Following the incident, Israel has steadily enhanced its air campaign in Syria against what it calls \u201cIranian targets\u201d.The conflict is becoming more complex with more powers intervening. Earlier, among external powers, only Russia and the U.S. were making direct interventions, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Turkey all supporting their respective proxies. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies may have taken a beating after rebels lost Aleppo, but Turkish and Israeli jets are now carrying out airstrikes in Syria. Russia appears to be stuck in the conflict. Its heavy bombing campaign helped turn the war in favour of the regime, but its attempts to push the government to make concessions in peace talks have been a failure.

A number of books deepen our understanding of this conflict. Syrian history over the last seven years can be best understood when seen in continuity from the Lebanese civil war; in turn, the Lebanese civil war can be explained better by going back to World War I when the French returned to Syria after the Treaty of Versailles and established Greater Lebanon. One book that I have repeatedly consulted in this regard is The War for Lebanon: 1970-1983 by Itamar Rabinovich. It is an excellent account of the first fully televised civil war of our times and captures the various phases of the conflict, starting with the U.S. intervention in Lebanon in 1958 and the setting up of the principal base of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Beirut in 1972. No civil war begins with a single move and the Lebanese civil war, which was partially driven by Syria\u2019s unwillingness to surrender its sovereign rights to other regional powers, lasted for 15 years and set the template in the region. Today, while Lebanon remains on tenterhooks on account of the ongoing Syrian civil war, one needs to look at both Syria and Lebanon as two acts of a single play. Despite the years that have passed since its publication, Thomas L. Friedman\u2019s From Beirut to Jerusalem remains a book of lasting importance and helps us understand the complex power play in a region that is shaped by religious and sectarian divide and the decisions and actions of ruthless politicians, and which attracts a lot of international intrigue. Friedman introduces readers to the state of play in the region in the early 1980s when Beirut was divided, Israel was waging wars against Lebanon and the PLO, and Syria was cracking down on the Sunni radicals who would gather strength decades later and challenge the government of the then President Hafez al-Assad\u2019s son and successor, Bashar al-Assad. Many Arab authors have written about the conflict, but some of the best insights have come from fiction writers. Among them is Emily Nasrallah, who passed away in March this year.

On the face of it, the whole story appears to be strange. In Syria, the civil war is complex. On the one hand, there is the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Hezbollah, Iran and Russia. On the other, a wide range of militias, from al-Qaeda and Islamic State jihadists to Free Syrian Army rebels, is fighting the regime. What has Israel got to do with a civil war between a hostile regime and a group of unpredictable dangerous militia groups?\nThe many conflicts in Syria In the initial years of the civil war, Israel\u2019s policy choices seemed to have been driven by the same calculation. The Assad regime and Israel have never been friendly. In the 1967 war, Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria and continues to occupy the region. More than a decade later, Syria intervened in Lebanon. It then provided help to militants, mainly Hezbollah, who were resisting an Israeli occupation of the country. Syria and Israel do not have formal diplomatic ties. Despite this, there was no direct military confrontation between the two countries. In fact, despite the hostility, Israel\u2019s border with Syria has been its calmest frontier for years. When the crisis broke in Syria in 2011, Israel was a fence sitter. It didn\u2019t want the stable secular dictatorship in its neighbourhood to be replaced by a bunch of militants. But as the Syrian civil war evolved into a regional conflict over the years, Israel\u2019s preferences and strategic calculations changed too.When the Syrian regime\u2019s position got weakened in the conflict, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group backed by Iran, sent thousands of its soldiers to the battlefield to defend the Assad government. Iran also sent Shia militants, who were recruited from different countries, to Syria. Besides the government army, these militias fought the war on the ground on behalf of the regime. Israel was alarmed by the growing role of Hezbollah and other Iran-sponsored militias in Syria. Since the early 1980s, Hezbollah has remained a thorn in Israel\u2019s regional strategy. In 2000, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, ending 18 years of occupation, mainly due to Hezbollah\u2019s guerrilla resistance. In 2006, Israel bombed Lebanon again to destroy Hezbollah\u2019s weapons infrastructure, but even after a month-long campaign, it failed to achieve its stated goals. Hezbollah has heavy military presence along southern Lebanon (or across Israel\u2019s northern border).\nSyria stunned by Hezbollah murder: WikiLeaks\nThe Syrian war allowed Hezbollah to coordinate with its Iranian patrons directly in the battlefield. Iran has also reportedly transferred short-range missiles and other sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah via Syria. Israel responded to this through a two-pronged strategy. First, it established contact with anti-regime rebels in southern Syria, closer to the Golan. Initially Israel offered medical aid and other humanitarian assistance to the rebels, which later acquired military and logistical dimensions. The plan was to carve out a buffer between the Golan Heights that Israel controls and the Syrian Golan. Israel didn\u2019t want Hezbollah or other Iranian proxies to take control of the border region. According to analyst Elizabeth Tsurkov, who wrote a detailed report on Israel\u2019s activities in southern Syria, Tel Aviv now offers support to seven different rebel groups in the region, including Liwaa Forsan Jolan, Firqat Ahrar Nawa, and a section of the Free Syrian Army. Besides providing money, weapons and intelligence, Israel also supported the advances by these groups on the ground with air cover. One such incident was the Israeli bombing of regime positions in southern Syria in April 2017 after local rebel groups came under heavy attacks by regime-backed troops.The second strategy was to retain the freedom to strike Hezbollah positions inside Syria. When Russia intervened in Syria, Israel negotiated for this freedom with Moscow. Since Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria in September 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin at least five times. Both nations developed a deconfliction mechanism that allowed Israeli planes to attack Hezbollah targets inside Syria without clashing with Russia, which is practically controlling most of the Syrian skies. This agreement worked perfectly for Israel. Last year alone, Israel said it struck suspected weapons shipments to Hezbollah around 100 times.But despite these on-and-off interventions, Israel has failed to build any substantial leverage in Syria\u2019s conflict zones. True, it has built influence among rebel groups in southern Syria. But developments in Syria over the past two years have scuttled Israel\u2019s strategic plans. The Israelis may have initially thought that the Russian intervention could reduce the Syrian regime\u2019s dependence on Iran, which is Tel Aviv\u2019s primary concern. But the Russians played on both sides. Their only strategic target was to rescue the regime. They neither stopped the Israelis from attacking Hezbollah targets inside Syria nor did they stop the Iranians from expanding their footprint in the country. Later, when the regime stabilised its rule, thanks to the Russian intervention, Iran\u2019s influence also grew. Iran now has various military facilities across Syria\u2019s regime-held territories.In southern Syria, Israel had built a network of rebels. But even in this area, its position has weakened over the past year. Jordan, which had offered support to the rebels in the early years of the civil war, changed its policy in the wake of heavy refugee flow. Last year, the Trump administration shut down the CIA\u2019s military operation command in Amman that was coordinating with Syrian rebels, leaving the rebels, particularly those in the south, entirely dependent on Israel. Besides, the regime forces are making advances towards the south. They have already established some posts near Quneitra in northern Golan. Late last year, the regime regained a foothold on the de facto border with Israel by capturing Beit Jinn from the rebels. In effect, Israel not only failed to contain the spread of Iranian influence in Syria, but is also under pressure to halt the advances of regime forces towards the south.It was against this background that Israel strengthened its bombing campaign in Syria this month. Prime Minister Netanyahu has also warned Iran \u201cnot to test our resolve.\u201d But beyond rhetoric, as the past incidents suggest, Israel\u2019s capacity to shape reality in Syria is limited. In seven years, Iran has built a huge network in Syria and emboldened Hezbollah. This cannot be eliminated by occasional aerial raids. A full-scale intervention is risky as long as Russia directly backs the regime. And if the regime forces capture Idlib and the Damascus suburbs, which is only a matter of time, they will shift their focus to the Israel-backed rebels in the south, dragging Tel Aviv deeper into the conflict.stanly.johny@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:58:20 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-israel-factor-in-syria/article22818024.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nWar for war: On U.S. strikes on Syria\n", "classes": ["drop-caps"], "content": "By launching a missile attack on Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump has made good on his threat to use force if chemical weapons are used in the civil war-stricken country, but he has also escalated the devastating, multi-sided conflict. This is the second time Mr. Trump has ordered a missile attack on Syria. Last year, after a chemical attack in Idlib province, the U.S. fired 59 cruise missiles at an airbase of President Bashar al-Assad. This time, after a suspected chemical attack in Douma near Damascus, the U.K. and France joined hands with the U.S. to punish Mr. Assad\u2019s regime. On Friday night, over 100 missiles targeted three regime facilities; with this, the Pentagon said, Syria\u2019s chemical weapons programme has been gutted. While the use of chemical agents against civilians cannot and must not go unpunished, the manner in which the U.S. and its allies have acted raises serious questions. The U.S. undertook the strike before the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons even began its investigation in Douma to ascertain if chemical weapons had in fact been used. It should have waited till the inter-governmental watchdog completed its investigation and then presented the case for action in the UN Security Council with requisite evidence. By acting merely on the basis of inputs from their intelligence agencies, the U.S.-led alliance flouted international law.\nWhat is Trump\u2019s Syria strategy?\nIt is also doubtful if Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished\u201d bravado is justified. The fact that a provocation was perceived for a second strike within a year suggests that the first one failed to deter the Assad regime. On the other hand, Mr. Trump has dragged the U.S. deeper into the Syrian civil war. If there is a future chemical attack, either by Mr. Assad or by his rivals, the U.S. will be forced to act again, perhaps more harshly. Worryingly, every time the U.S. bombs Syria, the chances of a military confrontation in the country between the U.S. and Russia heightens, given that Moscow remains firmly behind Mr. Assad. What Syrians need is not more bombs and missiles, but an end to the war, which has killed at least 400,000 people in seven years. There is no dispute that Mr. Assad is presiding over a monstrous military machine that has used brute force against his own people. But the ground reality in Syria is so complex that a sudden collapse of the regime would push the country and the millions who live in relative stability in regime-held territories into further misery. That is the last thing anyone wants. The focus of the West needs to shift from unilateral military action to aggressive multilateral diplomacy to find an immediate end to violence and then a long-lasting political solution. For that, the U.S. and Russia have to work together under a UN mandate.

The barbaric campaign of airstrikes and bombardments launched by government forces in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus, have killed at least 270 people in three days. Eastern Ghouta, with an estimated population of 400,000, is one of the last significant areas held by militants fighting the regime. It fell into the hands of the rebels in the early stages of the seven-year-long civil war, and repeated government attempts to overrun it were foiled. It was here that chemical weapons were used in 2013, killing hundreds of people. When most other rebel-held parts of Syria, including Aleppo, were recaptured by government troops, militants have moved to Eastern Ghouta and Idlib. Now both areas are under attack. In the use of heavy firepower, the assault resembles the government campaign in Aleppo and elsewhere. In Aleppo, one of Syria\u2019s largest cities, Syrian and Russian jets pounded rebel targets in late 2016; this was followed by a ground attack by government troops and Iran-trained militants. Similarly, Eastern Ghouta, which was under a government blockade for years, appears to have been surrounded by ground forces, which could advance to rebel positions inside the city any time.\nFear and outrage over bloodshed in Syrian enclave\nThere is a wide range of militant groups in Eastern Ghouta, including the Saudi-backed Jaysh al-Islam, the Qatar-funded Faylaq al-Rahman, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda. The government says the city is occupied by terrorists from these groups and that the few civilians remaining there are used as human shields. The militants in Eastern Ghouta and the jihadist elements amongst them have repeatedly shelled government-controlled neighbourhoods in Damascus. Generally the rebels appear to have lost the momentum against Mr. Assad in the civil war. Nonetheless, the government narrative is problematic as it holds all residents of Eastern Ghouta responsible for the occupation of the area by militants. The years-long blockade of the area that has deprived Eastern Ghouta of food and medicines, and the indiscriminate bombing, killing of unarmed civilians including children, expose the monstrosity of the Assad regime. From the very beginning of the civil war, the regime and its Russian and Iranian backers have paid little attention to human suffering, be it in Hama, Homs, Aleppo or Eastern Ghouta. Given the brutality it has unleashed now, the government could capture Eastern Ghouta as well. But at what cost? After seven years of war and 400,000 deaths, Syria is a broken, bleeding land, thanks to Mr. Assad and his friends and foes. The real tragedy is that none of the parties involved is interested in ending this war.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:58:56 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fire-and-fury/article22818648.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nWho is fighting who in Syria\n", "classes": [], "content": "Syria's conflict broke out in March 2011 with peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad's government but has evolved into a complex war involving jihadist groups and regional and international powers.Over 290,000 people have been killed and more than half Syria's population displaced in the conflict, which Turkey entered this week, dispatching troops to battle the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group and halt the advance of Kurdish forces.\nWHO IS FIGHTING WHO?\n\nRegime against rebels\nThe main battleline pits the approximately 300,000 soldiers of the Syrian army, and allied forces, against myriad rebel groups and Syrian and foreign jihadists.The largest anti-regime rebel alliance is the Army of Conquest, grouping Islamist factions like Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq al-Sham with jihadists such as Fateh al-Sham Front, previously Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front.The biggest battlefront at present is Aleppo city, divided between government and opposition control but surrounded by loyalist forces.The government is also fighting to retake control of Eastern Ghouta, next to Damascus, which is largely controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebel group.\nRegime against IS\nSyria's army has fought IS in several parts of the country, expelling the jihadists from the ancient city of Palmyra in March.\nRegime against Kurds\nSyria's Kurds have largely stayed out of the conflict between the government and armed opposition, but in August regime aircraft bombed Kurdish forces for the first time in Hasakeh, a city jointly controlled by the regime and Kurds.Kurdish forces now hold 90 per cent of Hasakeh.\nKurds against IS\nSyria's Kurds have carved out a semi-autonomous region in north and north-eastern Syria, with their People's Protection Units (YPG) becoming a key partner of the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS.Since January 2015, the YPG has ousted IS from the key towns of Kobane and Manbij in Aleppo province, Tal Abyad in Raqa province, and large parts of Hasakeh province.The YPG is also the key component of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which groups diverse factions battling IS.\nIS against rebels\nIS considers all those who fail to pledge allegiance to its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi its foes and has battled rebel groups and even rival jihadists.Rebels backed by Turkey participated in this week's capture of the border town of Jarabulus from IS.\nWHO SUPPORTS WHOM?\n\nRegime\nThe army is bolstered by 200,000 irregular forces, notably from the National Defence Forces. It also fights alongside between 5,000-8,000 forces from Lebanon's powerful Shia militia Hezbollah, as well as Iranian, Iraqi and Afghan fighters.Russia, a key regime backer, began an aerial campaign in support of Assad's government last September and has helped Damascus recapture areas in several provinces.Iran is another key ally, providing financial and military support.\nRebels\nOpposition factions deemed \"moderate\" are backed by the West, particularly the United States, France and the UK, though the forces have accused their supporters of providing insufficient support.Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar also back the opposition, and they have also lent support to Islamist factions.\nKurds\nSyria's Kurds are key partners of the anti-IS coalition headed by Washington, but Turkey considers the YPG to be a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara brands a \"terror\" group.\nJihadists\nNo country openly backs the jihadists of Fateh al-Sham and IS, although the latter has been able to rely on funds from taxation and resources in the territory it holds in Syria and Iraq.\nWHO CONTROLS WHAT?\n\nRegime\nSyria's government holds around 35 percent of the country, including strategic areas such as the capital Damascus, central Homs and Hama, the coast, and large parts of Aleppo. Sixty percent of the population lives under its rule.\nIS\nDespite setbacks since 2015, IS controls around 35 percent of Syria, much of it uninhabited. It dominates Deir Ezzor province on the Iraqi border and Raqa province.

When President Vladimir Putin decided to send Russian troops to Syria in September 2015, the regime there of President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of collapse. The Islamic State (IS) had already declared Raqqah in eastern Syria as its de facto capital. Rebels and jihadists had captured eastern Aleppo, Damascus suburbs, including Eastern Ghouta, Idlib province and southern towns like Daraa and Quneitra; they had also established a strong presence in Hama and Homs. Several rebel factions were breathing down on Damascus and the Mediterranean coastal belt, the stronghold of the regime. Three years later, Mr. Assad is safe, while his regime has recaptured most of the territories it lost in the early days of the war.Both Russia and Iran have played a crucial role in this turnaround. Though Russian air power was the most critical factor, especially in the battles for Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, the Iran-trained militias, including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, fought alongside the Syrian army on the ground against the rebels and jihadists. But even when they were partnering in the war against common enemies, the Russians and Iranians had different goals in Syria. For Mr. Putin, the Syrian intervention was a big gamble. He sensed that the Obama administration was indecisive despite its threats against the Assad regime and that the rebels were divided. His immediate plan was to salvage the regime, bolster Russia\u2019s position in West Asia (Syria hosts a Russian naval base at Tartus) and send a message to his rivals in the West.With the survival of the regime, Mr. Putin has achieved his immediate goal. But in the long run, he doesn\u2019t want Russia to get stuck in Syria, like the Soviet Union or the U.S. later got caught up in Afghanistan. Therefore, Moscow is continuously pressing the Assad regime to be ready for a lasting political solution to the crisis.Iran, on the other side, does not want any radical change in the current composition of the regime. Its immediate goal, like that of the Russians, was the survival of the regime. This was the common ground that brought both countries together in Syria. If Russia wanted to protect its naval base and expand its influence in West Asia through Syria, Iran does not want to lose its only ally in the region and a vital link with the Hezbollah. But in the long run, Iran wants to build permanent bases in Syria, stretching its military influence from Tehran through Baghdad and Damascus to southern Lebanon. Both Lebanon and Syria share borders with Israel. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has already established a strong military presence along Israel\u2019s northern border. Iran\u2019s plan was to apply strategic pressure on Israel by building more military infrastructure and deploying Shia militias closer towards the Israeli-occupied territories of Syria.When the war was on in full swing, these apparent differences were played down. The Russians and Iranians fought together alongside Syrian troops. But after Mr. Assad stabilised his rule over most of Syria\u2019s population centres (rebel/jihadist factions now control Idlib province and Daraa and Quneitra, while the Kurdish rebels have established autonomous rule in the northwest), the cracks in the pro-Assad coalition began to emerge.With the war winding down, Russia may now now be feeling less reliant on Iran, and Tehran is growing wary of Moscow\u2019s game plans. From the early days of the Russian intervention, Mr. Putin has been specific on not widening the scope of the war. There were several attempts aimed at provoking Russia which could have escalated the conflict. In November 2015, a Russian warplane was shot down by Turkey. Russia\u2019s response was a rather tame one, of economic sanctions. The U.S. bombed Mr. Assad\u2019s forces twice since Donald Trump became U.S. President. On both occasions, Mr. Putin overlooked the provocation. He did the same when Israel targeted Hezbollah positions within Syria.But the crisis escalated despite Mr. Putin\u2019s stance when Israel started directly attacking Iranian positions within Syria. In February, after Israel claimed an Iranian drone entered its air space, it carried out a massive bombing campaign in Syria against Iran. In May, immediately after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the multilateral Iran nuclear deal, Israel launched another major attack against Iranian targets. Interestingly, when the attack was under way, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Moscow. He watched Russia\u2019s Victory Day parade in Red Square marking the Soviet victory in the Second World War against Hitler\u2019s Germany. Israeli officials later told their Russian counterparts, \u201cIsrael will continue to maintain its operational freedom to act against Iranian entrenchment in all of Syria.\u201dRussia practically controls Syria\u2019s airspace. But it has entered into deconfliction mechanisms with the U.S. and Israel so that the three countries can carry out air strikes without hurting each other. While the U.S. has mostly carried out strikes against the IS, Israel has used Syrian air space only to attack Iran and Hezbollah, both of which are Russia\u2019s partners in the civil war. Yet, Mr. Putin hasn\u2019t done anything to defend his allies. He has also become more receptive to Turkey expanding its role in Syria. The increasing crack in the Russia-Iran axis was again on display when in May Mr. Putin called for all foreign troops to leave Syria once the war is over. Later Russia\u2019s Ambassador in Damascus clarified that the troops which Mr. Putin referred to include Iran\u2019s. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry was quick to respond, saying that it would remain in Syria \u201cas long as the Syrian government wants Iran to help it\u201d.Mr. Putin is likely conscious of Iran\u2019s vulnerability. Tehran does not have many allies. And after Mr. Trump threw a spanner into the Iran nuclear deal, it also faces the return of biting sanctions. It cannot afford to antagonise the Russians, certainly not at a time when the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel are teaming up to contain its influence. This Persian vulnerability allows Mr. Putin to maintain a delicate balancing act in a highly complex war theatre. For how long is now the question. Russia\u2019s tame responses to repeated aggression in Syria by other powers have already cast a shadow on its Syria strategy. Mr. Putin may be balancing his relations with several players for now to avoid a conflagration. But Israel and Turkey are not Russia\u2019s traditional allies. In West Asia, Israel is the strongest ally of the U.S., which remains Russia\u2019s most powerful geopolitical rival. And Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, an overhang of the Cold War, aimed at checking the West-ward creep of Russia\u2019s influence. In contrast, Tehran is Moscow\u2019s ally and partner, but Russia either doesn\u2019t want to or is not in a position to defend Iran\u2019s interests in Syria.This is the dilemma that confronts Mr. Putin: how he can restore Russia\u2019s lost glory in the new Cold War if he cannot even defend the interests of his partners in a country (Syria) where he appears to be in control.stanly.johny@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:55:51 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/russian-games-in-syria/article24146944.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nLong game in Syria ", "classes": [], "content": " The U.S.\u2019s decision to create a new Kurdish-led border force in northeastern Syria to defend the areas captured from the Islamic State (IS) could open a new phase of conflict in in the country. Swathes of territory on the Syrian-Turkish border, mostly populated by the Kurds, are now controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-Arab militia that was in the forefront of the land war against the IS. With the planned 30,000-strong border force, which will mostly draw fighters from the SDF, the U.S. is not only institutionalising the militia, but also setting the stage for a prolonged stay in Syria. From the outset of the Syrian civil war, the U.S. has been on the losing side. The Obama administration had called for the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad and was supporting anti-Assad rebels as well as running a clandestine CIA-run programme to unseat him. But the 2015 Russian intervention in Syria sabotaged those plans and helped Mr. Assad consolidate power and recapture most of the territory lost to rebels and jihadists. Then the U.S. shifted its focus to defeating the IS and establishing its influence in the country. In that bid, Kurds, who were facing IS advances, proved helpful. At present, the country is divided into three major camps. Most cities and population centres, including the Mediterranean coast, are controlled by the regime, while rebels and al-Qaeda-linked jihadists run Idlib province (which is now under attack by regime-Russian forces). In northeastern Syria, Kurds have carved out a semi-autonomous region. It\u2019s here that the U.S. is cultivating its proxies. The U.S.\u2019s plan is to carve out a sphere of influence in the middle of West Asia\u2019s most dangerous conflict and have it guarded by the battle-hardened Kurdish forces. This enclave could help the U.S. in designing future plans in the region. But the move carries great risks. First, Turkey, an American ally and a NATO member, is already angry. Turkey, which fights a Kurdish militancy on its soil, sees any further empowerment of the Syrian Kurds as an immediate threat to security, and has vowed to fight the new \u201cterrorist\u201d army. If Ankara attacks the border force, that would raise tensions between the U.S. and Turkey further. Second, throughout the civil war, the Syrian regime and the Kurds maintained a complex relationship. They were hostile to each other, but never fought against each other, barring some isolated incidents. Syrian Kurds, unlike their Iraqi counterparts, do not demand independence. Rather, they emphasise on autonomy and a federated post-war state structure. These are the issues that should be discussed as part of any final settlement between the regime and the Kurds. But the latest U.S. plans pre-empt any such future deal. This will keep Syria divided forever, leaving the Kurds fully dependent on U.S. aid in the wake of increased regional tensions, while the U.S. gets another foothold for its West Asian geopolitical manoeuvring.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:59:31 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/long-game-in-syria/article22458054.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "Timeline of the Syrian civil war and US\u00a0response", "classes": [], "content": "Express Audio: Veteran journalist Coomi Kapoor on media freedom and how it has changed over the yearsThe US attack on a Syrian air base came after years of heated debate and deliberation in Washington over intervention in the bloody civil war.

The first target was a scientific research center located in the Greater Damascus area. \u201cThis military facility was a Syrian Center for the research development, production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology,\u201d he said, adding that the second target was a chemical weapons storage facility. We assessed that this was the primary location of Syrian sarin and precursor production equipment. The third target, which was in the vicinity of the second target, contain both the chemical weapons equipment storage facility and an important command post,\u201d he said.Dunford said that the nw strikes were qualitatively and quantitatively different than the one conducted in 2017. Last year, the US conducted a unilateral strike on a single site. The focus was on the aircraft associated with the Syrian chemical weapons attack in April of 2017. \u201cThis evening, we conducted strikes with two allies on multiple sites that will result in a long-term degradation of Syrians capability to research, develop and employee, chemical and biological weapons. Important infrastructure was destroyed which will result in a setback for the Syrian regime,\u201d he said.\u201cThey will lose years of research and development data, specialized equipment, and expensive chemical weapons precursors. The strike was not only a strong message to the regime that their actions were inexcusable, but it also inflicted maximum damage without unnecessary risk to innocent civilians,\u201d Dunford said.Responding to questions, Mattis said that \u201cright now this is a one-time shot\u201d and it sent a very strong message to Assad. \u201cWe did have some initial surface to air missile activity from the Syrian regime. That is the only retaliatory action that we\u2019re aware of at this time,\u201d Dunford said, adding that the nature of the operation and targets that were assigned to the United States Central Command have been completed.The United States, France and Britain, Dunford said, \u201cdid not do any coordination\u201d with the Russians on the strikes, nor did they were pre-notified by the US. \u201cThe only communications that took place specifically (with Russians) with this operation before the targets were struck was the normal deconfliction of the airspace, the procedures that are in place for all of our operations in Syria,\u201d he said .US Vice President Mike Pence, who is currently travelling to Lime in Peru to attend the Summit of the Americas, abruptly left its opening ceremony to notify the Congressional leadership of the air strikes in Syria.Pence spoke to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, his spokesperson Jarrod Agen told reporters travelling with him.

The assault was part of an indiscriminate campaign by President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces to retake the town and the rest of the enclave from the rebels.A medical charity supporting hospitals in the Ghouta region, the Syrian American Medical Society, said doctors in Kafr Batna were treating patients for severe burn wounds.

The media office for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led and US-backed force that operates in the Kurdish autonomous region in the north, said also that at least 30 were wounded in Friday\u2019s attacks. Victims lay dead the streets in pools of blood, according to a video from the Observatory, which monitors Syria\u2019s seven-year civil war and which put the death toll at 18. Different casualty tolls are common in the immediate aftermath of big attacks.Since their January offensive began, Turkish forces have nearly encircled Afrin in an effort to drive the Syrian Kurdish fighters from the town and the surrounding region. Residents say they are facing bread, water, and electricity shortages. The Observatory and activists reported seeing hundreds of civilians filing out of Afrin to neighboring villages on Thursday and Friday, looking for relief.

The civil war in Syria has had far reaching implications throughout the world, in the form of a drastic immigration crisis, the establishment of radical terrorist organisations in the Middle East and the fear of humanitarian violence that spread across the globe.The multiple pronged struggle currently going on in Syria, with the Assad regime on one end, the rebels at another and the radical Islamist forces at yet another end, has been at the receiving end of the wrath and sympathy from almost all of the global powers depending to a large extent upon the political benefits that each could derive from the region. American policy towards the Syrian trouble has been particularly significant, for several reasons foremost being the hegemonic influence the country has tried to maintain in the Arab region for decades now, to the extent that the current crisis in the continent is seen as being almost a byproduct of American aggression.But Trump\u2019s decision to attack the Syrian base today can hardly be seen in tune with the overall structure of foreign policy maintained by America towards the country. Trump had fervently decided to not make humanitarian interventions in the US, but rather focus on uprooting Islamic terror groups for the sake of avoiding terror attacks on American soil. However, the recent act of aggression seems a volte face, as reports mention his change of stance being a response to the kind of deplorable suffering of the victims of the chemical attack. For that matter, America\u2019s response to Syria, particularly under the administration of the last two presidents have seen significant shifts over time, depending on the political necessities of the moment. In order to understand what Trump\u2019s sudden change of heart could mean, we reflect upon the evolution of American policy towards Syria since the governance of George W Bush.George BushAnalysing the Bush government\u2019s policy towards Syria, political scientist J\u00fclide Karako\u00e7 calls it a case of \u201cindirect orientalism\u201d, by which she means that the US maintained favourable positions against certain players in the Middle East- Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia- so as to impose a position of power upon the rest of the Arab region. Accordingly, while Israel was held up as a model of western values, Syria was seen as a backward and radical power. The most important document supporting this attitude was the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act (SALSRA), that imposed several sanctions upon Syria so as to halt the sponsor of terrorism and giving up on weapons of mass destruction, apart from asking the country to hold unconditional negotiations with Israel.The most radical step towards a Syrian policy came in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks when the US launched a \u2018war on terror\u2019, categorising certain states of the Middle East, including Syria and Iraq as \u2018rogue states\u2019 that sponsored terrorism. The Bush policy towards Syria was to isolate it from its neighbours. When under his administration, America invaded Iraq in 2003, it left behind a country caught in sectarian bloodshed and ripe for the growth of radical Islamic organisations that would go on to be the creators of some of the biggest cases of havoc in the region.Barack ObamaAmerican invasion of Iraq in 2003 had resulted in the government being met with severe criticism, both from internal and external players. When Barack Obama took over the administration in 2008, he had before him the popular demand to end the aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan. For the ordinary American the wars had cost them their tax money and the lives of the soldiers.Thereafter when the Syrian crisis began in 2011, while the American president understood the humanitarian necessities to intervene, he remained firmly resolved to not respond with military aggression. He was aware of the economic and human costs that the war would entail. His decision was further backed by the United Kingdom and Germany.However, in 2012 Obama made a strong remark when he warned the Assad administration of a change in American policy if he crossed the \u2018red line\u2019 by using chemical or biological weapons. Soon after, the Assad regime did infact engage in a chemical attack, resulting in America contemplating a response involving military powers. However, on being advised against such a move by the Congress, Obama refrained from going down that road.However, in 2014, the former president did in fact decide to intervene in Syria, but not against the Assad regime, rather to uproot the radical Islamic rebel group, ISIS. The change in position came after the public release of two videos depicting the beheading of American journalists by ISIS agents. The following three years America continued with its war against the organisation in Iraq and Syria through bombings from aircrafts and missiles fired from warships. While Obama has, right from the beginning been against the Assad regime and supported the rebel forces, when he did decide to intervene in the Middle Eastern state, it was a means to end the calamity caused by a radical rebel group. His decision was seen as a response to humanitarian necessities and a way to keep away terrorism from American shores. Nonetheless, post his presidential tenure, Obama has consistently been on the receiving end of criticism for being unable to sort out the situation in Syria.Donald TrumpWhen the Obama administration attacked Syria in 2013, Donald Trump tweeted out a sharp criticism against the move. \u201c\u201dWhat I am saying is stay out of Syria. The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix USA,\u201d said Trump back in 2013.When he took over the role of the American president he was firmly resolved not to intervene against the Assad regime on humanitarian grounds. His position was also affected by the fact that Russia, who Trump favours, has been in support of the Assad regime.If at all Trump would intervene in Syria, he maintained it would be against the ISIS for the sake of protecting America from terrorist activities. However, when the chemical strikes did take place in Syria a day back, he was quick to criticise the Obama administration for being weak and irresolute in their response to Assad. \u201cPresident Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a \u2018red line\u2019 against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing,\u201d said Trump. Soon after he launched the missile strike on Syria, marking a huge drift from his initial foreign policy. As per his address to the nation, his decision to attack the Syrian air base comes in response to the huge humanitarian crisis created by Assad there. \u201cSyrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians. Assad choked out the lives of helpless men women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many, even beautiful babies. No child of god should ever suffer so much,\u201d said Trump.Interestingly, however, reports suggest that Russia was intimated about the attack beforehand, suggesting Trump\u2019s efforts at maintaining relations with the East European power who has been favourable towards Assad. The shift in Trump\u2019s policy, keeping Russia by its side is a major development in global policy towards the Assad regime. What it means for Syrian civilians, rebel groups and the government in future, only time will tell.\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/adrija-roy.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />Adrija RoychowdhuryAdrija is\u00a0senior sub-editor, Indian Express.

I was happy there. God willing, we\u2019ll be back like before,\u201d says Malak.Russia is the latest country to enter the ongoing civil war in Syria\u2018The night images are very unbelievable. The Syrian people need help.\u2019The war in Syria has led to massive economic losses estimated at over $200 billion since the conflict began in 2010.The move marks the most significant attempt by Lebanon to stem the influx of some 1.5 million Syrians seeking refuge.More than 200,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011 against Bashar al-Assad\u2019 govtt.Almost half of all Syrians have been forced to abandon their homes since the conflict began in March 2011.President Hollande comments came after Assad\u2019s regime said it was willing to work with the international community.UN criticized the world\u2019s \u201cparalysis\u201d over the fighting in Syria.One million Syrian refugee children live in Lebanon and millions are trapped by conflict inside Syria.In the past Saudi Arabia appeared reluctant to embark on a comprehensive counter-terror strategy.Syrian government forces seized a town from rebels near the Lebanese border to cut off opposition fighters\u2019 fluid supply lines.

There are red lines, and the censorship that was there before 2011 is still there today,\u201d said Omar Abu Saada, one of the country\u2019s best-known theatre directors.The play \u2013 called \u201cWhile I Was Waiting\u201d \u2013 is based on the real-life story of a young man found beaten unconscious near a hospital in Damascus in 2013, but the circumstances of his beating and subsequent death remained unclear. Abu Saada knew the man and his family.\u201cWhen I thought about working on a new project, this was the story that came to my mind. It pretty much imposed itself,\u201d he said.In the play, the man oscillates between life and death and the lack of answers unnerves his family. His suspended state is a metaphor for the state of waiting that all Syrians share, whether inside the country or abroad and regardless of their political views, the director said. Another thing all Syrians share is loss, he added.The Syrian conflict, which began with a popular uprising against the state, has raged on into its seventh year. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half of Syrians homeless, and created the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis.\u201cSyrians today are not in a single place, they are suspended. Waiting is something that we all have in common,\u201d Abu Saada said. \u201cMost people lost someone close, either by death, emigration or imprisonment. Everyone lost something.\u201dThis has changed the way Syrians think, their social fabric and even they way they make art, he said. The play charts the disenchantment of young Taym, the comatose patient, from his hope for change at the start of the 2011 uprising to his despair as it spiralled into a war.Syria\u2019s young generation, active in organising and documenting the mass protests, lost the most in the violent turn of events, he said. \u201cThe state of coma is more of a metaphor for the lack of power to change things,\u201d Abu Saada said.The play made its debut in Brussels in 2016 and has since been staged in France, the United States and Japan among other places.\u00a0The six cast members said they could not meet anywhere in the Arab world for rehearsals because of visa restrictions.\u201cSo in the end, we rehearsed in France which under normal circumstances would have been the harder place to go to,\u201d said Nanda Mohamed, a Syrian actress.The writer, who has previously lived in Lebanon, had to leave Beirut in 2015 when the Lebanese government imposed stricter conditions on Syrians in the country. But he said being forced to leave Lebanon helped him view the war differently.\u201cSometimes the geographical distance helps create the gap for critical thinking and I tried to take advantage of that,\u201d said Mohamed al-Attar, 38.\u201cWhat happened to us was tragic but what would be more tragic is if we couldn\u2019t review things. It would be disastrous if after the heavy price we paid and we continue to pay that we also do not have the courage to think about what we lost and boldly criticize it,\u201d Attar said.Attar previously worked in Beirut with director Abu Saada on an adaptation of the Greek myth Antigone performed by an all-female cast of Syrian refugees.\u00a0Both agree the play is about fuelling debate about a war that is not yet over.\u201cThe idea of creating a play about something that you are living in the middle of and still being affected by and probably have not yet processed is difficult,\u201d Abu Saada said. \u201cBut I know that there is no running away from it.\u201d"}{"head": "India welcome to play a role in reconstruction of Syria, says Bashar\u00a0al-Assad", "classes": [], "content": "Express Audio: Veteran journalist Coomi Kapoor on media freedom and how it has changed over the yearsSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has said India is welcome to play a role in the reconstruction of the war-ravaged country.

The latest round of talks begins days after the Islamic State jihadist group was forced out of its de facto capital Raqa in northern Syria, in a major victory for the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces.Recent rounds of talks in the Central Asian nation have focused on ironing out the details of a Russia-led plan for four de-escalation zones in Syria. \u201cClosed-format talks have begun,\u201d Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman Anuar Zhainakov told AFP, adding that the two-day negotiations would conclude with statements to the press.Zhainakov confirmed that delegations from the Syrian government and the rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s overthrow had arrived in Astana, as had negotiators from Turkey and regime backers Russia and Iran. Despite backing opposite sides in the war, Ankara and Moscow have been working closely on Syria since a 2016 reconciliation ended a crisis caused by the shooting down of a Russian war plane.A de-escalation zones plan was first tabled in Astana in May to minimise fighting between government forces and moderate rebel factions, as well as improve access for aid for civilians living in the zones. But international organisations painted the humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta \u2014 covered by the zones deal and located just outside the capital Damascus \u2014 in dire terms earlier this month.UNICEF says over a thousand children in the area are suffering from severe, acute or moderately acute malnutrition, with over 1,500 more at serious risk, as aid convoys have failed to reach needy populations. While the de-escalation zones brought about an initial\nreduction in fighting, the International Red Cross has voiced concern that the violence has intensified again, including in the zones. Previous rounds of Astana negotiations have ended without major breakthroughs, but they have made more progress than the parallel UN-driven talks on Syria in Geneva.The last round of talks in September saw Russia, Turkey and Iran agree to jointly police a buffer zone in the contentious northern province of Idlib, where Ankara and Tehran are viewed as having competing interests. Zones covering part of the south of the country, Eastern\u00a0Ghouta, and the central province of Homs had already been agreed during a previous round of talks. Russian military police were then deployed to secure the areas. Syria\u2019s United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura urged parties to move on from the zones towards \u201ca more stable political settlement\u201d during a mid-October visit to Moscow.The next round of Geneva talks will begin on November 28, De Mistura has said. Russia\u2019s military intervention two years ago in the\u00a0Syrian war that has claimed more than 330,000 lives to date turned the tables in Assad\u2019s favour.

Some were toting bags from the Damascus airport duty-free.The men were private Russian military contractors, the latest human cargo in a secretive airlift using civilian planes to ferry military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his six-year fight against rebels, a Reuters investigation of the logistical network behind Assad's forces has uncovered.The Airbus they flew on was just one of dozens of aircraft that once belonged to mainstream European and U.S. aviation companies, then were passed through a web of intermediary companies and offshore firms to Middle Eastern airlines subject to U.S. sanctions - moves that Washington alleges are helping Syria bypass the sanctions.The flights in and out of Rostov, which no organisation has previously documented, are operated by Cham Wings, a Syrian airline hit with US sanctions in 2016 for allegedly transporting pro-Assad fighters to Syria and helping Syrian military intelligence transport weapons and equipment.The flights, which almost always land late at night, don't appear in any airport or airline timetables, and fly in from either Damascus or Latakia, a Syrian city where Russia has a military base.The operation lays bare the gaps in the US sanctions, which are designed to starve Assad and his allies in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Hezbollah militia of the men and materiel they need to wage their military campaign.It also provides a glimpse of the methods used to send private Russian military contractors to Syria - a deployment the Kremlin insists does not exist. Russian officials say Moscow's presence is limited to air strikes, training of Syrian forces and small numbers of special forces troops.Reuters reporters staked out the Rostov airport, logged the unusual flights using publicly available flight-tracking data, searched aircraft ownership registries and conducted dozens of interviews, including a meeting at a fashionable restaurant with a former Soviet marine major on a US government blacklist.Asked about the flights and the activities of Russian private military contractors in Syria, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin referred Reuters to the Defence Ministry - which didn't reply to the questions.The Syrian government also didn't reply to questions.In response to detailed Reuters questions, Cham Wings said only that information on where it flies was available on its website.The flights to Rostov aren't mentioned on the site. But the journeys do appear in online flight-tracking databases. Reporters traced flights between the Rostov airport and Syria from Jan 5, 2017, to March 11, 2018. In that time, Cham Wings aircraft made 51 round trips, each time using Airbus A320 jets that can carry up to 180 passengers.The issue of military casualties is highly sensitive in Russia, where memories linger of operations in Chechnya and Afghanistan that dragged on for years. Friends and relatives of the contractors suspect Moscow is using the private fighters in Syria because that way it can put more boots on the ground without risking regular soldiers, whose deaths have to be accounted for.Forty-four regular Russian service personnel have died in Syria since the start of the operation there in September 2015, Russian authorities have said. This number does not include 39 Russian service personnel who died in a non-combat plane crash in Latakia on March 6. A Reuters tally based on accounts from families and friends of the dead and local officials suggests that at least 40 contractors were killed between January and August 2017 alone.One contractor killed in Syria left Russia on a date that tallies with one of the mysterious nighttime flights out of Rostov, his widow said. The death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus gave his cause of death as\"haemorrhagic shock from shrapnel and bullet wounds.\"To sustain his military campaign against rebels, Assad and his allies in Russia, Iran and the Hezbollah militia need access to civilian aircraft to fly in men and supplies. Washington has tried to choke off access to the aircraft and their parts through export restrictions on Syria and Iran and through Treasury Department sanctions blacklisting airlines in those countries.The Treasury Department has also blacklisted several companies outside Syria, accusing them of acting as middlemen.\"These actions demonstrate our resolve to target anyone who is enabling Assad and his regime,\" John E. Smith, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in testimony to a congressional committee in November.In recent years, dozens of planes have been registered in Ukraine to two firms, Khors and Dart, that were founded by a former Soviet marine major and his onetime military comrades, according to the Ukraine national aircraft register. The planes were then sold or leased and ended up being operated by Iranian and Syrian airlines, according to the flight-tracking data.One of the companies, Khors, and the former marine major, Sergei Tomchani, have been on a US Commerce Department blacklist since 2011 for allegedly exporting aircraft to Iran and Syria without obtaining licences from Washington.But in the past seven years, Khors and Dart have managed to acquire or lease 84 second-hand Airbus and Boeing aircraft by passing the aircraft through layers of non-sanctioned entities, according to information collated by Reuters from national aircraft registers.Of these 84 aircraft, at least 40 have since been used in Iran, Syria and Iraq, according to data from three flight-tracking websites, which show the routes aircraft fly and give the call sign of the company operating them.In September, the US Treasury Department added Khors and Dart to its sanctions blacklist, saying they were helping sanctioned airlines procure US-made aircraft. Khors and Dart, as well as Tomchani, have denied any wrongdoing related to supplying planes to sanctioned entities.The ownership histories of some of the aircraft tracked by Reuters showed how the US restrictions on supplies to Iranian and Syrian airlines may be skirted. As the ownership skips from one country to the next, the complex paper trail masks the identity of those involved in Syria's procurement of the planes.One of the Cham Wings Airbus A320 jets that has made the Rostov-Syria trip was, according to the Irish aircraft register, once owned by ILFC Ireland Limited, a subsidiary of Dublin-based AerCap, one of the world's biggest aircraft-leasing firms.In January 2015, the aircraft was removed from the Irish register, said a spokesman for the Irish Aviation Authority, which administers the register. For the next two months, the aircraft, which carried the identification number EI-DXY, vanished from national registers before showing up on the aircraft register in Ukraine.The Ukrainian register gave its new owner as Gresham Marketing Ltd, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. The owners of the company are two Ukrainians, Viktor Romanika and Nikolai Saverchenko, according to corporate documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. Ukrainian business records show they are managers in small local businesses.Contacted by phone, Romanika said he knew nothing and hung up. Saverchenko couldn't be reached by phone and didn't respond to a letter delivered to the address listed for him.In March 2015, Gresham leased EI-DXY to Dart, according to the Ukrainian aircraft register. The identification number was changed to a Ukrainian number, UR-CNU. On Aug 20, 2015, Khors became the aircraft's operator, the register showed.A representative of the Ukraine State Aviation Service said the register was not intended as official confirmation of ownership but that there had been no complaints about the accuracy of its information.From April that year, the aircraft was flown by Cham Wings, according to data from the flight-tracking websites.Gillian Culhane, a spokeswoman for AerCap, the firm whose subsidiary owned the plane in 2015, didn't respond to written questions or answer repeated phone calls seeking comment about what AerCap knew about the subsequent owners and operators of the plane. Dart and Khors didn't respond to questions about the specific aircraft.Four lawyers specialising in US export rules say that transactions involving aircraft that end up in Iran or Syria carry significant risks for Western companies supplying the planes or equipment. Even if they had no direct dealings with a sanctioned entity, the companies supplying the aircraft can face penalties or restrictions imposed by the US government, the lawyers said.The lawyers, however, said that the legal exposure for aircraft makers such as Boeing and Airbus was minimal, because the trade involves second-hand aircraft that are generally more than 20 years old, and the planes had been through a long chain of owners before ending up with operators subject to sanctions.Two of the lawyers, including Edward J. Krauland, who leads the international regulation and compliance group at law firm Steptoe & Johnson, said US export rules apply explicitly to Boeing aircraft because they're made in the United States. But they can also apply to Airbus jets because, in many cases, a substantial percentage of the components is of US origin.Boeing said in a statement: \"The aircraft transactions described that are the subject of your inquiry did not involve The Boeing Company. Boeing maintains a robust overall trade control and sanctions compliance program.\"An Airbus spokesman said, \"Airbus fully respects all applicable legal requirements with regard to transactions with countries under UN, EU, UK and US sanctions.\"When Reuters sent a series of questions to Khors and Dart about their activities, Tomchani, the former marine major, called the reporter within minutes.He said he was no longer a shareholder in either firm but was acting as a consultant to them, and that the questions had been passed on to him. He invited the reporter to meet the following day at the high-end Velyur restaurant in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.In the 90-minute meeting, he denied providing aircraft to Iran or Syria. Instead, he said, Khors and Dart had provided aircraft to third parties, which he did not identify. Those third parties, he said, supplied the planes on to the end users.\"We did not supply aircraft to Iran,\" Tomchani, a man of military bearing in his late 50s, said as he sipped herbal tea.\"We have nothing to do with supplying aircraft to Cham Wings.\"Neither Dart nor Khors could have sold or leased aircraft to Cham Wings because they were not the owners of the aircraft, he said.Tomchani used to serve in a marine unit of the Soviet armed forces in Vladivostok, on Russia's Pacific coast. In 1991, after quitting the military with the rank of major, he set up Khors along with two other officers in his unit. Tomchani and his partners made a living by flying Soviet-built aircraft, sold off cheap after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in war zones.Khors flew cargoes in Angola for the Angolan government and Defence Ministry and aid agencies during its civil war. Tomchani said his companies also operated flights in Iraq after the US-led invasion in 2003, transporting private security contractors.Ukraine's register of business ownership showed that Tomchani ceased to be a shareholder in Khors after June 2010 and that he gave up his interest in Dart at some point after April 2011. He told Reuters he sold his stakes to \"major businessmen\",but declined to name them.He did say, however, that the people listed at the time of the interview in Ukraine's business register as the owners of the two companies were merely proxies. One of the owners in the register was a mid-ranking Khors executive, one was an 81-year-old accountant for several Kiev firms, and another was someone with the same name and address as a librarian from Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.According to the business register, the owner of 25 per cent in Khors is someone called Vladimir Suchkov. The address listed for him in the register is No. 33, Elektrikov Street, Kiev. That's the same address as the one listed in Ukrainian government procurement documents for military unit No. A0515, which comes under the command of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate.Tomchani said he and Suchkov were old acquaintances. \"He wasn't a bad specialist,\" Tomchani said. \"A young lad, but not bad.\"He said he believed Suchkov was living in Russia.Reuters was unable to contact Suchkov. A telephone number listed for him was out of service. The Ukrainian Intelligence Directorate's acting head, Alexei Bakumenko, told Reuters that Suchkov doesn't work there.Reuters found no evidence of any other link between the trade in aircraft and Ukraine's broader spy apparatus. Ukrainian military intelligence said it has no knowledge of the supply of aircraft to Syria, has no connection to the transport of military contractors from Russia to Syria, and hasn't cooperated with Khors, Dart or Cham Wings.On Jan 9 this year, Dart changed its name to Alanna, and listed a new address and founders, according to the Ukrainian business register. On March 1, a new company, Alanna Air, took over Alanna's assets and liabilities, the register showed. Although Moscow denies it is sending private military contractors to Syria, plenty of people say that's untrue. Among them are dozens of friends and former colleagues of the fighters and people associated with the firm that recruits the men - a shadowy organisation known as Wagner with no offices, not even a brass plaque on a door.It was founded by Dmitry Utkin, a former military intelligence officer, according to people interviewed during this investigation. Its first combat role was in eastern Ukraine in support of Moscow-backed separatists, they said. Reuters was unable to contact Utkin directly.The League of Veterans of Local Conflicts, which according to Russian media has ties to Utkin, declined to pass on a message to him, saying it had no connection to the Wagner group.Russia has 2,000 to 3,000 contractors fighting in Syria, said Yevgeny Shabayev, local leader of a paramilitary organisation in Russia who is in touch with some of the men. In a single battle in February this year, about 300 contractors were either killed or wounded, according to a military doctor and two other sources familiar with the matter.A Russian private military contractor who has been on four missions to Syria said he arrived there on board a Cham Wings flight from Rostov. The flights were the main route for transporting the contractors, said the man, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Vladimir. He said the contractors occasionally use Russian military aircraft too, when they can't all fit on the Cham Wings jets.Two employees at Rostov airport talked to Reuters about the men on the mysterious flights to Syria.\"Our understanding is that these are contractors,\" said an employee who said he assisted with boarding for several of the Syria flights. He pointed to their destination, the fact there were no women among them and that they carried military-style rucksacks. He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he wasn't authorised to speak to the media.Reuters wasn't able to establish how many passengers were carried between Russia and Syria, and it is possible that some of those on board were not in Syria in combat roles. Some may have landed in Damascus, then flown to other destinations outside Syria.Interviews with relatives of contractors killed in Syria also indicate the A320 flights to Rostov are used to transport Russian military contractors. The widow of one contractor killed in Syria said the last time she spoke to her husband by phone was on Jan 21 last year - the same day, according to flight-tracking data, that a Cham Wings charter flew to Syria.\"He called on the evening of the 21st ... There were men talking and the sound of walkie-talkies. And by the 22nd he was already not reachable. Only text messages were reaching him,\"said the woman, who had previously visited her husband at a training camp for the contractors in southern Russia.After he was killed, she said, his body was delivered to Russia. She received a death certificate saying he had died of\"haemorrhagic shock from shrapnel and bullet wounds.\"The widows of two other contractors killed in Syria described how their husbands' bodies arrived back home. Like the first widow, they spoke on condition of anonymity. They said representatives of the organisation that recruited their husbands warned of repercussions if they spoke to the media.The two contractors had been on previous combat tours, their widows said. The women said they received death certificates giving Syria as the location of death. Reuters saw the certificates: On one, the cause of death was listed as\"carbonisation of the body\" - in other words, he burned to death.The other man bled to death from multiple shrapnel wounds, the certificate said.One of the widows recounted conversations with her husband after he returned from his first tour of duty to Syria. He told her that Russian contractors there are often sent into the thick of the battle and are the first to enter captured towns, she said.Syrian government forces then come into the town and raise their flags, he told her, taking credit for the victory.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

According to one scholar, Russia helped build the modern Syrian military, and Mr Assad is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strongest allies in the Middle East.Russia has often blocked meaningful international action on Syria by vetoing proposals at the UN Security Council, and Moscow changed the course of the war in Mr Assad's favour with a military intervention in 2015.The United States has been reluctant to become too entangled in Syria, but it has acted for two main reasons.First, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) began developing a foothold in the country in 2013.The next year, the United States launched air strikes against the militant group. It eventually sent ground troops into the fight, and about 2,000 US forces are now deployed there.Second, the United States has acted to punish the Assad government for using chemical weapons such as sarin and chlorine gas on Syrian civilians.In 2012, President Barack Obama called the use of chemical weapons a \"red line\" that would prompt military intervention.The following year, a sarin gas attack in Eastern Ghouta killed about 1,400 people, according to the US government's assessment.Mr Obama pushed for a strike but couldn't get congressional approval.Instead, he came up with a diplomatic solution. The UN Security Council ordered Mr Assad to destroy his chemical weapons stockpile and sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits countries from producing, stockpiling or using chemical weapons.There have been several reports of chemical weapons attacks since then.One particularly bad strike took place April 4, 2017. Nearly 100 people were killed in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun in an apparent sarin attack.It garnered worldwide headlines and the attention of President Trump, who expressed horror at the images of \"innocent children, innocent babies\" poisoned by a nerve agent.Just a few days after that attack, Mr Trump authorised a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base.It was the first direct US strike on the Syrian regime in the war.One of Mr Assad's key allies is Iran. Iran needs Syria to move its weapons and proxy militias across the Middle East.So when Mr Assad seemed threatened, Iran stepped in to support him. So did Hizbollah, the Lebanese political party and militia that is a close ally of Teheran.That upset Iran's rivals in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. So they began sending arms and money to anti-Assad rebels, including extremist militias.Israel has begun attacking Assad bases with air strikes.That means that today, there are many wars being fought inside Syria. The Syrian government is still at war with the rebels. Israel is at war with Iranian-backed forces. And the United States is trying to kill off ISIS.Horrible. Syrian families often don't have basic necessities, like food, shelter and medical care. Children can't go to school. The war is being fought in towns and on the streets.Since the start of the war, more than 465,000 Syrians have been killed, 1 million more have been injured, and 12 million - more than half the country's population - have been forced to flee their homes.More than 5.5 million have moved abroad and registered as refugees.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Their mouths and noses were covered with foam.Other videos showed victims including children being treated for breathing problems and hosed down.Doctors and aid organisations on the ground reported strong smells of chlorine, and described symptoms consistent with exposure to sarin, a nerve agent.Medics and rescuers said the alleged chemical attack killed more than 40 people and injured hundreds.Both the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ally Russia have denied responsibility.Here are accounts from survivors of the alleged chemical attack, medical workers, and those displaced during the seven-year civil war.The twin girls refused to leave behind their pink Dora the Explorer backpacks when they were evacuated from Douma last week, said their mother, Umm Nour.Now at al-Bol refugee camp in Aleppo province, Malaz unzipped her backpack and pulled out a cardboard box. It contained a little blonde doll.\"She spoke to the doll, telling her, 'you might suffocate but you will be safe from the bombing',\" said Umm Nour, adding that her daughter's voice was filled with sorrow when she said that.\"Yesterday, they were playing, they were digging a trench, a tunnel for the ants outside our tent,\" Umm Nour told CNN. \"They told me it was so the ants could have a place to hide and stay safe if there was an attack.\"The twins said they want to be doctors when they grow up so they can save wounded children.Referring to the popular uprising of March 2011, which later spiralled into civil war, Umm Nour said of her daughters: \"They were two months old when the revolution began. What have they seen in life, what do they know that is pure or kind?\"All they have seen is blood, the dead, the wounded.\"\"I was coming up the stairs from the basement and got an indescribable tightness in the chest, inability to breathe, and headache...I went back downstairs and started splashing water on myself, wiping my face, and splashing more water.\"\"When the smell hit us, we threw up. My mouth filled with phlegm. I couldn't stop coughing,\" said Malak, who was underground when the alleged chemical strike happened.\"We got to a clinic, where they hosed us with water and gave us oxygen.\"Holding up the key to his house in Douma, Malak's husband, Dervish, said: \"I brought it with me. Maybe one day we will be able to go back.\"They have two children, three years old and four months old.\"His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow,\" the medical student said of a man he treated.\"Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well. I could see he was going to die.\"\"I felt my throat close, my body go limp as if I had just had everything sucked out of me,\" said Umm Nour, who was with her family in a basement when the toxic rounds hit.When she and her twin daughters reached the fourth floor, their building was shelled.\"It was like we were between two deaths - the chemical attack on the lower floors and the other strikes hitting the upper ones,\" she recalled.\"What really got my attention was...this little boy who was hit by a sniper. So there's somebody out there who had the ability to look through a telescope, and knew he was shooting a 12-year-old boy,\" said the surgeon, who declined to give his name.\"There were times when they aimed for pregnant women, and aimed to shoot the baby. What were the political affiliations of those children in the womb? What kind of threat were they to anybody?\"\"The thing which... affected me the most was seeing the children. When it starts affecting children, that's where I draw the line,\" said the Syrian-American doctor at the al-Amal Hospital in Turkey, near the Syrian border. He is based in the United States and travels to Turkey to volunteer as a surgeon at the hospital.\"I think in this war you have a whole generation exposed to massive trauma. It's going to affect how they grow, how they think.\"\"I was young when we fled. My father said we used to live a normal life in Syria. I wish I could remember it,\" said the teenager. He has been living in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan for five years.\"Our children, who were born during the war, know nothing about what normal life would look like,\" said the activist in Eastern Ghouta in Syria.\"They do not know the different types of fruits.

But a log-in is still required for our PDFs."}{"head": "What you need to know about the civil war in Syria", "classes": [], "content": "Video footage of Syrian children choking to death in agony in a chemical attack on the north-western town of Khan Sheikhoun has alarmed the international community, triggering calls for tougher actions in the war-torn country.The chemical assault on Tuesday (April 4), which has killed at least 70 people, many of them children and women, likely involved a banned nerve agent, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and medical experts say.It's the deadliest chemical assault on a civilian population in Syria since a sarin nerve agent attack in 2013 by government forces on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus.Here's a quick look at the conflict in Syria, now into its sixth year:The trouble began in March 2011 in the city of Deraa where a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad took place. Locals protested after 15 schoolchildren were arrested and reportedly tortured for writing anti-government graffiti on a wall. The protest began peacefully, with the protesters asking for the release of the children and calling for democracy and greater freedom in the country.The government, however, responded angrily and the army opened fire on the protesters on March 18, 2011, killing four people. The next day, they shot at mourners at the funerals, killing another person. The public outrage spread to other parts of the country, triggering nationwide protests demanding Mr Assad's resignation.By July that year, hundreds of thousands of people were taking to the streets across Syria. Opposition supporters began taking up arms, first to defend themselves and later to push out security forces from their local areas.The country eventually plunged into civil war, with anti-government rebel groups battling government forces for control of cities and towns. The fighting reached the Syrian capital Damascus and second city of Aleppo in 2012.Successive rounds of peace talks, including a United Nations-sponsored meeting in Geneva in March 2017, have failed to produce a political breakthrough.Those demanding that Mr Assad steps down include rebel fighters, political parties who disagree with the Syrian leader, and those living in exile who cannot return to the country. The conflict has also pitched the country's Sunni majority against the president's Shia Alawite sect.In addition, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has capitalised on the chaos and taken control of large swathes of Syria and Iraq, where it has proclaimed the creation of a caliphate in June 2014. Its foreign fighters are involved in a \"war within a war\" in Syria, battling rebels and rival militants from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, as well as government and Kurdish forces.Almost half a million people are estimated to have been killed and more than 11 million, about half the population, are displaced either internally or as refugees, putting Syria in the international spotlight. Syrians fleeing the conflict are faced with rising anti-foreigner sentiment, or xenophobia, in countries that are grappling with security threats like terrorism and crimes.The conflict has caused at least US$16 billion (S$23 billion) in damage to agriculture - about a third of the country's Gross Domestic Product, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has said, calling for more funds to salvage local food production as millions go hungry. The fightings have led to extensive crop and livestock losses, and destroyed greenhouses, veterinary clinics, irrigation systems, tractors and other assets.More than seven million people in Syria are classified as \"food insecure\", meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from, according to the FAO.Russia has significant economic and military interests in Syria, such as a Mediterranean naval base at Tartus, and it is in Russia's interest that the Assad regime does not collapse.President Vladimir Putin also wants to send a message to the world that Russia is still a force to be reckoned with. The US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the 2011 toppling of Muammar Gadhafi's Libyan regime - helped by an international coalition bombing campaign - left Moscow deprived of key allies. Syria under Mr Assad is seen by the Kremlin as a key pillar of its strategic influence in the Middle East and Moscow is reluctant to let it go.Moscow is also concerned with rising Islamic violence. It fears an ISIS victory in Syria would have reverberations at home, as some of the top military commanders of the militant group are Russian speakers of Chechen origin.Because of its interests in Syria, Russia has blocked resolutions critical of Mr Assad at the UN Security Council and has continued to supply weapons to the Syrian military despite international criticism.In response to the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun, France and the US have put forward a draft UN resolution demanding a full investigation into the attack. Russia's deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov told the UN council that the proposed resolution was hastily prepared and unnecessary, but he voiced support for an inquiry.Under Mr Barack Obama's administration, the US made Mr Assad's departure a key goal. In August 2013, a sarin gas attack around the town of Ghouta left hundreds dead and Washington said Mr Assad had crossed a \"red line\".Mr Obama threatened an air campaign to topple him but called it off at the last minute when the Syrian leader agreed to give up his chemical arsenal under a deal brokered by Moscow.In mid-2014 as Washington increased support to moderate rebels to fight Mr Assad's regime, US officials privately conceded that the Syrian leader wasn't going anywhere soon and admitted the difficulty in removing him. By September 2015, then US Secretary of State John Kerry said Mr Assad had to go but the timing of his departure should be decided through negotiation.Before Mr Donald Trump became president, he had strongly urged Mr Obama not to order military intervention against the Assad regime. And he came to office promising both to improve ties with Syria's ally Russia and to focus US efforts in Syria solely on the defeat of the ISIS.But following the chemical attack on Tuesday, Mr Trump condemned it as a \"horrific\" strike against \"innocent people, including women, small children and even beautiful little babies\".Asked if it crossed a red line for him, he replied: \"It crossed a lot of lines for me... Beyond a red line. Many, many lines.\"Reports said his remarks may suggest a greater US role in protecting the Syrian population in a vicious civil war that he has always said the US should avoid.SOURCES: BBC, Reuters, AFPWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

ISIS has been finally defeated, and is now reduced to the role of a marginal if not irrelevant Middle Eastern player.But that will count for little when it comes to restoring any stability in the region. The victors in Raqqa are a mixed force of Arabs and ethnic Kurds dominated by the YPG, the disciplined and experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters' organisation linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party in neighbouring Turkey, a movement which is itself regarded as a terrorist organisation.Turkey will not tolerate for long the YPG's success, mainly because it fears this would lead to trouble within Turkey itself. Turkey's armed forces already operate inside Syrian territory, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is threatening a full-scale invasion unless the Kurds are pushed back.And Syria's own Sunni Arabs are also not happy with the presence of Kurdish fighters inside Raqqa, the heartland of Sunni Syria. Kicking out ISIS kept all these disputes in abeyance. Now that this task is over, the real fight between Kurds, Arabs and Turks will intensify. And the United States, which provided logistical and intelligence help to the siege of Raqqa, faces an even bigger quandary.US security planners would dearly like Syria's Kurds to turn now against the militias inside Syria that owe their allegiance to Iran, in order to reduce Iran's baleful influence. But quite apart from the fact that this may be too late as Iran is well ensconced in Syria, there is also the question of Turkey's opposition to any such move.One conclusion is, sadly, certain: Raqqa's fall only means Syria's civil war changes tack and intensifies.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

It recommended that the UN Security Council refer the findings to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecutions.Karen AbuZayd, an American commissioner on the panel, said the documented cases represented the \"tip of the iceberg\".Government forces raped civilians during house searches and ground operations in the early stages of the conflict, and later at checkpoints and detention facilities, the report said.The youngest known victim was a nine-year-old girl.\"Rape of women and girls was documented in 20 government political and military intelligence branches, and rape of men and boys was documented in 15 branches,\" the UN war crimes investigators said.The independent experts - who have compiled confidential lists of suspects since 2011 - did not name individual perpetrators but said they had documented \"numerous\" cases of rapes by high-level officers.\"Sexual violence against females and males is used to force confessions, to extract information, as punishment as well as to terrorise opposition communities,\" the report said.Victims suffered shame, depression, incontinence, impotence and miscarriages, and rejection by their families, it said.\"Some interviewees have indicated it is worse for a girl to be raped than to be killed,\" AbuZayd said. \"A number of women and girls sometimes commit suicide due to the verbal abuse they suffered in their homes or communities.\"AbuZayd said that rape of men and boys was often overlooked but also devastating.\"It's an exceedingly ugly crime. We know it's awful for women, but it's pretty bad for men as well.\"They were forced to have intercourse with one another and with other relatives. They tell you about losing their masculinity, becoming impotent. They were gang-raped or with objects and things, having some really serious consequences of illness and incontinence,\" AbuZayd said.The investigators found \"no evidence of a systematic practice\" by armed groups to use sexual violence, but some incidents had occurred in sectarian or revenge attacks.They received allegations of extremist and terrorist groups imposing \"mediaeval punishments on men accused of homosexuality\", including throwing them off tall buildings.\"On Islamic State, we recorded women being stoned for adultery, frequently for violations of the dress code, detention and beatings of women including pregnant women for minor violations, and forced physical examination to determine virginity,\" said Hanny Megally, a UN commissioner.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

And it could create another dangerous moment with the potential to escalate the seven-year civil war into a wider conflict.Already, multiple global and regional powers have been sucked in. Last week saw the tensest standoff in decades between nuclear rivals Russia and the US. On the ground, American and Turkish soldiers occupy separate chunks of the country's north, while Iranians and Russians fight alongside Mr Assad's army.In the skies, Israel has for the most part enjoyed freedom of manoeuvre, thanks to its air superiority - and an implicit green light from Moscow. Both conditions may now change.Mr Amos Yadlin has firsthand experience of how Israel responds to such threats - and no doubts about how it would handle this one.A former military intelligence chief, Mr Yadlin was also one of the Israeli pilots who destroyed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. The deployment of S-300s in Syria has been a concern for two decades, and \"at the end of the day, it will happen\", he said.\"If I know the air force well, we have already made proper plans to deal with this threat. After you remove the threat, which is basically what will be done, we're back to square one.\"Russia already has sold S-300 systems to Iran over American and Israeli objections. Syria was on track to get them too - until 2013, when Russian President Vladimir Putin froze the contract in response to pleas from Israel.But Mr Putin said at the time that if the US attacked, Moscow would \"think how we should act in the future\".That moment arrived with last week's missile strikes by the US, Britain and France, in response to an alleged chemical attack by Mr Assad's army.Hours afterwards, Russia's first deputy chief of staff, Mr Sergei Rudskoi, said his government would reconsider whether to supply the air defences to Mr Assad. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hammered home the message in a BBC interview two days later, saying the plan might be revived because Russia feels it must do \"whatever is required to help the Syrian army deter aggression\".Israel has carried out at least 150 bombing raids in Syria since the civil war began in 2011, according to Mr Zvi Magen, a former Israeli ambassador in Moscow. The latest, on April 9, hit an air base used by the Iranian military; other targets have included arms convoys bound for Hezbollah, the Iranian-armed Shiite group in Lebanon that has repeatedly fought with Israel.S-300s can fire missiles at six targets simultaneously, and have a range of 200km. That would extend into the airspace of Lebanon, sometimes used by Israeli planes to strike Syria - and even into Israel itself.\"It's an exceptionally advanced system that can cover large swaths of territory,\" said r Michael Oren, Israel's deputy minister for public diplomacy and an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Given Israel's likely response, some analysts in Moscow say it makes more sense to use the threatened deployment as a bargaining chip.Actually delivering the weapons \"would fuel tensions in the region and cause major friction with Israel\", said Ms Elena Suponina, a Middle East expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, which advises the Kremlin.\"It's enough to provide Syria with other air-defence systems that won't provoke such a response.\"Even Syria's current Soviet-designed systems, which have been upgraded over the last 18 months, have inflicted some damage. In February, an F-16 was shot down, said to be the first Israeli aircraft lost in action since the early 1980s.And while the Pentagon says that all of the more than 100 missiles fired in last week's strike reached their targets, Russia says that two-thirds of them were intercepted. A pro-opposition Syrian monitoring group, citing aerial defence officers, made a similar estimate.\"Syria already has some good short- and medium-range systems,\" said Mr Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor at Jane's Defence Weekly. Add the S-300s, and \"they would be able to form a fairly comprehensive, multi-layered air defence umbrella over their country\".In any attempt to destroy the new weapons, Israel would probably use US-built F-35 stealth aircraft and electronic warfare, he said.Russian military experts say that while the S-300 is very powerful, it is not foolproof.\"There's no invincible air-defence system,\" said Mr Viktor Murakhovsky, a former army colonel who is now a government adviser. \"Just like there are no invincible aircraft.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Russia and Iran played a major part in that outcome - but they cannot afford a bill estimated at a quarter-trillion dollars.Enter China?Mr Qin Yong, vice-president of the China-Arab Exchange Association, said he sees burgeoning interest among Chinese companies.\"We get phone queries every day,\" he said. \"They see huge business potential there because the entire country needs to be rebuilt.\"The enthusiasm is reciprocated on the Syrian side, said Mr Qin. \"They're like, don't come tomorrow, come tonight.\"As the 61/2-year war winds down, with President Bashar al-Assad still in power, the battle for influence in Syria has shifted to the diplomatic arena. Reconstruction, which the United Nations said could cost US$250 billion (S$336 billion), is a key part of it.Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared victory in his two-year military operation to shore up Mr Assad and is now appealing for international funds. At his annual press conference on Dec 14, Mr Putin showed signs of frustration.He said Syria, whose conflict sparked the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, will remain a breeding ground for extremist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria without improved living standards.\"All people of goodwill around the world should understand that if we do not resolve this together, it will be their problem as well,\" he said.The United States and its European and Gulf Arab allies, which backed the Syrian rebels, said that problem is largely of Mr Putin and Mr Assad's making. They have eased up on calls for the Syrian leader's immediate departure, but continue to insist that he cannot stabilise the country and has no long-term future.Withholding money for reconstruction is one of the few cards they have left. Syria has little ability to generate cash internally to pay for its own rebuilding.Diplomats in Moscow said Russia has repeatedly pressed EU governments to help foot the bill. At the same time, Russia has rebuffed calls for Mr Assad to step down eventually, and his government has shown few signs of willingness to share power.The European Union, Arab nations and the US put aside US$9.7 billion in April for humanitarian aid and rebuilding Syria. But Mr Assad insists nations which supported the Syrian opposition in the civil war will not get a role in reconstruction, even if they want one.Mr Abd al-Kader Azouz, a consultant to Mr Assad's government, said money can be found from wealthy Syrians, the Brics group of emerging economies and multilateral lenders not controlled by the West.A few deals have been reached. Last year, Syria said it had agreed on \u20ac850 million (S$1.4 billion) worth of contracts for Russia to rebuild infrastructure. Iran signed accords worth \"several hundred million euros\" to repair power grids, Press TV reported in September.Mr Qin's association estimated there could be US$2 billion worth of investment at this stage.He said the companies he has been escorting to Damascus, Homs and Tartus, including China National Heavy Duty Truck Company, are eyeing projects to build roads, bridges, airports and hospitals and restore electricity and communications.That may just be the beginning because Syria fits into Chinese strategy. The country was a key link on the ancient Silk Road, and President Xi Jinping's most ambitious plan involves building a new one - the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to weave a Chinese web of trade and transportation links across Eurasia and Africa.For all those grand visions, there is an immediate obstacle for Chinese business in Syria, according to Mr Qin: Settlements in dollars and euros are banned because of US and EU sanctions aimed at cutting Mr Assad's regime off from the world economy.That is one indicator that, without a compromise on Mr Assad's future, Syria is likely to remain partially destroyed for years to come. Professor Robert Ford, who was US ambassador to Damascus during the early years of the war and is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington and a Yale professor, said the deals mooted so far are a drop in the ocean.\"We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars,\" he said. \"Syria needs billions. It's going to fall well short of what's needed to rebuild the country, which means that the country won't be rebuilt very quickly.\"WASHINGTON POSTWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

There is also a likelihood that militants trained by ISIS in Syria will commit attacks in Russia.And the ISIS threat has already hit Russia, with Moscow admitting last week that an ISIS-claimed bomb blew up a plane of Russian tourists that took off from Egypt.The former Soviet Union, which Russia was the biggest state of, used to be the dominant power in the Middle East, but had in recent decades seen its influence diminish. Syria is Russia's sole remaining ally and the only place in the region where the once-mighty Russian navy still has a base.Western powers had been intervening in Syria's civil war for years, and have actively called for Mr Assad's removal, but they have failed to unseat him.Mr Putin's sudden move to send troops to support Mr Assad can be seen as him not wanting to lose Russia's last ally in the Middle East, and also wanting to have a say in Mr Assad's successor when he eventually departs.It is also part of the wider effort to counter what Russia sees as the United States' influence globally in instilling democratic revolutions in countries like Ukraine after the Soviet era.As Russia's influence diminished not only in the Middle East but globally, Mr Putin has been on a crusade to restore national pride.His decisive and muscular intervention in the Syrian conflict - coming soon after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and the involvement in Ukraine's own civil war - has allowed him to project an aggressive image, and renewed Russia's standing, for better or for worse, in the eyes of the world.The fact that it took Western powers, especially the United States, by surprise in its intervention, leaving them floundering for a response, is another important point. It shows that Russia can act unilaterally and in total secret, which contrasts with the style of Western leaders who tend to talk first and act later, if at all.And after Russia has acted, there is little Western powers can do except issue condemnations, short of a direct confrontation, which no country has the appetite for.Mr Putin remains popular among the Russian people precisely for this rapacious image, despite the faltering Russian economy.Observers have suggested that the Russian intervention is about energy supplies.The Middle East is crucial to the global supply price of oil and gas, which are also Russia's chief trading commodities.Saudi Arabia's decision to hold down prices in an effort to regain market share against shale oil producers has damaged the Russian economy.By intervening in Syria, it is sending a message to the Saudis that it is a player in the politics of oil.Another benefit of the Syria campaign is that it diverts attention from the war in Ukraine, which Russia had a hand in after taking over Crimea. Pro-Russia rebels also started a revolt in east Ukraine. The crisis went so far as to be responsible for the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane, reports claim.Russia was slapped with sanctions over the saga, but now the West has something else to fill its Russia roster with besides Ukraine.Bonus trivia: The rate of sorties being flown by Russian jets over Syria has been described as impressive, as they seem to be generating close to a theoretical maximum number possible for 32 fixed-wing combat aircraft - if the information provided by Russia about their operations is accurate.As many as 96 fixed-wing combat aircraft sorties per day can be carried out, assuming maximally efficient logistics and maintenance.Most military officials predicted a rate of 20 sorties per day.In the latest report, Russia's air force flew 141 sorties and hit 472 terrorist targets in Syria over the Nov 21 and 22, the RIA news agency quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying on Monday (Nov 23).Sources: Reuters, Time.com, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The National Interest, Straits Times archivesWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria crisis, said in Beirut.Syria is the worst place in modern history in terms of attacks on healthcare workers and facilities, accounting for 70 percent of all such attacks worldwide, he said.U.N. data shows 89 healthcare workers died in 92 confirmed military attacks on healthcare facilities between Jan 1 and May 4, compared to 73 killed in 112 attacks in the whole of 2017, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria crisis.The two areas which saw the most healthcare attacks in 2018 were Eastern Ghouta and Idlib.Eastern Ghouta had been the largest rebel-held pocket near the capital Damascus, but came back under government control in mid-April after a fierce offensive.Idlib, in northwest Syria, is the largest remaining area under opposition control, containing around 2.5 million people.Idlib's population has ballooned over the course of the conflict, with people there from fighting inn other areas. The government has also transferred a large number of rebel fighters and their families to Idlib as part of surrender deals elsewhere in Syria.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to take back every inch of Syria.Moumtzis said the U.N. does not want to see a repeat of what happened in Ghouta happen in Idlib. He urged the warring sides to come to a peaceful solution.Moumtzis also said he was concerned about poor aid access in Syria.In 2017, 27 percent of requests made by the U.N. to Syrian authorities for permission to deliver aid were granted. In the first four months of 2018 only seven percent were granted, Moumtzis said.The number of people designated by the U.N. as living in besieged areas has fallen dramatically this year to stand at 11,100, after the Syrian government took back control of almost all rebel-held pockets around the capital Damascus.But 2.05 million people in need of humanitarian assistance still live in hard-to-reach areas, the U.N. said.(Reporting by Lisa Barrington; editing by Andrew Roche)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "Syria 'chemical attack': What we know", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "BEIRUT:\u00a0An alleged chemical attack in Syria's rebel-held Douma has sparked international outrage, with Washington warning on Sunday (Apr 8) of possible military action, while Damascus and Moscow said the reports were mere \"fabrications\".WHAT HAPPENED?Syria's White Helmets, who act as first responders in rebel-held areas of Syria, said the attack took place late on Saturday using \"poisonous chlorine gas\".\"More than 500 cases - the majority of whom are women and children -\u00a0were brought to local medical centres with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,\" according to a joint statement issued by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) and the White Helmets.Patients showed signs of \"respiratory distress, central cyanosis, excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour\", it said.Medics had \"observed bradycardia, wheezing and coarse bronchial sounds\".The statement said civil defence volunteers had found 42 casualties dead in their homes \"with similar clinical symptoms of excessive oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns\". Six others had died while receiving treatment.Footage posted online by the White Helmets, which was not possible to verify, showed victims with yellowed skin crumpled on the ground and foaming at the mouth.Douma is the last remaining opposition-held town in Eastern Ghouta, once the rebels' main bastion outside Damascus but now ravaged by a seven-week regime assault.Since Feb\u00a018, Syrian and Russian forces have waged a fierce military onslaught.WHO WAS BEHIND IT?While no one has yet provided evidence of its involvement, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country's seven-year civil war.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the regime carried out a wave of air strikes on Douma on Friday and Saturday that killed nearly 100 people, including many who suffered breathing difficulties.Syria and its Russian ally denounced the claims as \"fabrications\", with Russia warning of potential \"dire consequences\" if they were used as a pretext for military action.HOW HAS THE WORLD REACTED?US President Donald Trump warned there would be a \"big price to pay\".\"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"President (Vladimir) Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.

It called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting.Pope Francis described the allegations as \"terrible news\", saying: \"Nothing, nothing can justify the use of such devices of extermination against defenceless people and populations.\"WILL MILITARY ACTION BE TAKEN?White House security adviser Tom Bossert refused to rule out US military action in response to the alleged chemical strike. \"I wouldn't take anything off the table,\" he said.US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the reports, if confirmed, \"are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community.\"Prominent Republican senator Lindsey Graham warned Trump that a failure to act now could leave him in a weakened posture internationally.\"It's a defining moment in his presidency,\" Graham said.WHAT OTHER MAJOR CHEMICAL ATTACKS?A chemical attack with the nerve agent sarin in the Eastern Ghouta enclave in August 2013 killed 1,429 people, including children, the US says.Sarin was also detected in an April 2017 attack on the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhun that killed more than 80 people.

Security Council, including President Bashar al-Assad's strongest ally Russia, passed a resolution on Saturday calling for a 30-day countrywide ceasefire. But the measure has not taken effect, with Moscow and Damascus saying they are battling members of terrorist groups excluded from the truce.Russia has instead called for daily five-hour local ceasefires to establish what it calls a humanitarian corridor so aid can enter the enclave and civilians and wounded can leave.The first such truce took place on Tuesday but quickly collapsed when bombing and shelling resumed after a short lull.There were no air strikes during Wednesday's five-hour ceasefire, but heavy bombardment resumed in the afternoon, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported.There has been no sign of aid deliveries to the besieged area.President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had managed to evacuate \"quite a big group\" of civilians and that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had helped broker the evacuation. He did not say when the civilians had managed to leave.The Observatory said it could not confirm the evacuation.Moscow and Damascus have accused rebels of shelling the corridor to prevent people leaving. Rebels deny this, and say people will not depart eastern Ghouta because they fear the government.Wednesday's ground assault targeted the Hawsh al-Dawahra area at the eastern edge of the enclave.The Observatory reported advances by the government forces in the area, describing it as the resumption of an assault that first began on Feb. 25. It said rebels had inflicted heavy losses on government forces.An official with one of the rebel groups in eastern Ghouta said fighters were battling to repel an attempted incursion, and characterised the battle as \"back and forth\".A commander in the military alliance that backs Assad said an elite unit of the Syrian army, the Tiger Force, was taking part in the assault and advances had been made.France's foreign ministry called on Russia and Iran, Assad's other military ally, to exert \"maximum pressure\" on the Syrian government to implement the 30-day ceasefire.But with no sign of decisive international pressure to stop the attack, eastern Ghouta appears on course to eventually meet the same fate as other areas won back by the government in lengthy, punishing assaults, where rebels and civilians who oppose Assad were finally evacuated in negotiated withdrawals.Damascus appears to be applying tried and tested military means, combining air strikes and bombardment with ground assaults, as it did to recapture eastern Aleppo in 2016.A senior Western diplomat said Russia appeared intent on a repeat of Aleppo in eastern Ghouta by evacuating the area and then killing \"the terrorists even if it's not just Nusra\", a reference to a jihadist group with al Qaeda links.A senior U.S. general on Tuesday accused Moscow of acting as \"both arsonist and firefighter\" by failing to rein in Assad.U.S., RUSSIA CLASH OVER CHEMICAL WEAPONSDiplomatic sources have said the chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, opened an investigation into attacks in eastern Ghouta to determine whether banned munitions were used.The United States says it has evidence Syrian forces have used chlorine, which is permitted for civilian purposes but banned as a weapon, in attacks in eastern Ghouta and elsewhere.U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said on Wednesday that Russia has violated its duty to guarantee the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile and prevent the Assad government from using poison gas.Syria agreed to give up its stockpile of poison gas and join the international chemical weapons ban in 2013 under a Russian-brokered deal that averted U.S. retaliatory air strikes after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Ghouta.Washington accused Damascus last year of again using nerve gas and carried out a round of air strikes as punishment.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Syria had eliminated its poison gas stockpiles, and described allegations it was still using chemical weapons as \"absurd\".U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman told the Security Council on Wednesday the scale of attacks by the Syrian government against eastern Ghouta \u201ccannot be justified on the basis of targeting Jabhat al Nusra fighters.\u201d\u201cThe air strikes, shelling, and ground offensives continue. There are even reports of yet another chlorine gas attack. What we need is implementation of 2401, and that is not happening,\u201d Feltman said.Lavrov said militants entrenched in eastern Ghouta were blocking aid and the evacuation of people who want to leave. Moscow would continue to support the Syrian army in totally defeating the \"terrorist threat\", Lavrov told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.Rebels have intensified shelling of nearby government-held Damascus. A medical official in the capital said on Monday 36 people had been killed in four days. Damascus and Moscow say the campaign in eastern Ghouta is needed to halt such shelling.The multi-sided Syrian war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven half of the pre-war population of 23 million from their homes. Fighting has escalated on several fronts this year, with the collapse of Islamic State giving rise to conflict between other Syrian and foreign parties.As Assad has pressed the offensive against eastern Ghouta, Turkey has launched an incursion against Kurdish fighters in the northwestern Afrin region.(Reporting by Tom Perry, Laila Bassam and Dahlia Nehme in Beirut and Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles in Geneva, John Irish in Paris, Denis Pinchuk in Moscow, Michelle Nicols at the United Nations; writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Mark Heinrich)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "Fresh violence mars first day of Syria enclave 'truce'", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "DOUMA, Syria:\u00a0A \"humanitarian pause\" announced by Russia in Syria's deadly bombardment of Eastern Ghouta failed to end violence on Tuesday (Feb 27), with fresh bloodshed and no sign of aid deliveries or residents leaving the besieged enclave.Nine days after Russian-backed regime forces intensified their campaign against the rebel-held enclave, the deal offered some respite to civilians who had been hiding in their basements.But the first day of a five-hour daily \"pause\" that was ordered by President Vladimir Putin on Sunday and kicked off at 9.00am (3.00pm Singapore time) was marred by violence that saw six people killed.Moscow's plan falls short of a broader 30-day ceasefire it agreed to at the United Nations Security Council but which has yet to take effect, and has inspired little trust from among the besieged enclave's 400,000 residents.The regime deployed buses at the Al-Wafideen checkpoint to transport residents wanting to use a humanitarian corridor to flee what UN chief Antonio Guterres last called \"hell on earth\".But no civilians were seen venturing towards the regime forces guarding the checkpoint, where large portraits of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Putin could be seen side-by-side.The \"humanitarian pause\" ordered by Putin echoed a similar tactic employed by Russia and Syrian regime during the ferocious battle to force rebels out of Aleppo in 2016.Russia's defence ministry accused armed groups in Eastern Ghouta of shelling the corridor, and said rebel fighters had \"continued attacking the positions of the government forces\" and \"went on the offensive in other directions too\".Syrian state news agency SANA said a former Al-Qaeda affiliate present in the enclave was blocking civilians \"to use them as human shields\".'TRUCE A FARCE'Some residents left the basements they had been cowering in for days to check on their property and buy food.But many in the enclave, which lies on the eastern outskirts of the Syrian capital, appeared distrustful of a \"pause\" announced by Damascus's main ally.\"This Russian truce is a farce. Russia is killing us and bombing us every day,\" said Samer al-Buaidhani, a 25-year-old from Douma, Eastern Ghouta's main hub.\"I don't believe it's safe for me or my family to leave by this system,\" he told AFP.International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said any evacuation needed deeper coordination.\"Under international humanitarian law, humanitarian corridors are things which need to be well planned and must be implemented with the consent of parties on all sides, not only with one side,\" she told AFP.Violence levels were significantly lower on Tuesday as the \"humanitarian pause\" kicked in but six civilians were killed by regime bombardment, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.The bombardment intensified again after 2.00pm (8.00pm Singapore time), the Britain-based group said.Since Feb\u00a018, 582 civilians, almost a quarter of them children, have been killed in the Syrian and Russian bombardment of Eastern Ghouta, making it one of the bloodiest episodes of the country's seven-year-old conflict.Fourteen of the dead, including five children, were pulled from the rubble on Tuesday after being killed in the past two days, said the Observatory.In Damascus, the state news agency said, a civilian was killed and five others wounded by shelling from \"terrorist organisations\".ALEPPO SCENARIOIn Hammuriyeh, another town in the sprawling semi-rural enclave, Mohammed Abdullah said the pause left civilians with a choice between two evils.\"The truce is not in the people's interest, we have two options: death or displacement,\" said the 30-year-old.\"The campaign we were targeted with was an extermination campaign, not a simple bombardment. What we want is a full and permanent ceasefire for all of Ghouta,\" he said.That sentiment was echoed by the dominant rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta, who sent a letter to the United Nations stating their willingness to expel militants as soon as a full ceasefire takes effect.The main rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam, Faylaq al-Rahman and Ahrar al-Sham -\u00a0declared their \"complete commitment to deport\" militant\u00a0fighters.Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group made up mostly of fighters from Al-Qaeda's ex-affiliate Al-Nusra Front, is present in some parts of the enclave.The letter said such an evacuation, which has been discussed previously but never yielded any result, would take 15 days and start when a UN truce takes effect.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reacted cautiously to the statement and said after meeting French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian that the ball was in the rebel groups' court.\"We shall see in practice whether the pleas by the three illegal armed groups ... to carry out the UNSC resolution correspond with their intentions,\" he said.A top US general accused Moscow of playing an \"incredibly destabilising\" role in Syria by claiming it wants to settle the civil war while at the same time stoking the conflict.The Syrian government lost control of Eastern Ghouta in 2012 and has besieged it almost ever since.The latest scenario put in place by the regime and its Russian ally was reminiscent of the deal that ended the battle of Aleppo in 2016.Few civilians back then initially used the Aleppo corridors unilaterally announced by Russia.Some started fleeing after renewed bombardment and the rest eventually evacuated when a multilateral deal was reached with Turkey.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "As civil war rages on, Syrians eye escape route to Germany", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "\n                                Not since the end of World War II has Europe faced such a huge influx of migrants, with most of them from war-torn Syria.DAMASCUS: A recent report published by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) found that around 40 per cent of Syria\u2019s 24 million population have been displaced by the ongoing civil war. The world has been shocked by stories of incredible hardship faced by migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea, and images of those who do not make it, like the toddler whose body was found floating in the surf. Such heartbreaking stories also make their way back to Syria adding to the anxiety of those still planning to leave.But that anxiety is still better than coping with the constant fear of day-to-day life in war-torn Syria. Nearly five years of civil war has left the country devastated \u2013 and its people, hopeless and homeless.  Those who have not yet left, are struggling to survive. Like Rami Nader, a 32-year-old father of two, who works 16 hours a day as patisserie chef and is planning to emigrate to Germany.\"I was living in Yarmouk \u2013 the Palestinian camp south of Damascus - when the rebels entered, we had to flee,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to spend the night in a public garden in Damascus for a few days until I found an apartment for rent. It\u2019s expensive \u2013 around 30,000 Syrian pounds (US$159) - so I had to work two shifts to feed my children.\"Most Syrians wish to go to Germany after the country\u2019s Chancellor, Angela Merkel, so clearly stated that they would be welcome there. Rami\u2019s wife is already there living with his relatives. His dearest wish is to join them.\"Before the crisis, the situation was good, nobody wanted to emigrate, but now, because of the conditions and the high cost of living, it's too much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can easily die on our way to work from one of the many mortar bombs launched by the rebels \u2013 we are living in a constant state of fear and horror all the time.\"Sam Barjak, 13, cannot wait to leave. He dreams of becoming a doctor \u2013 and he knows he will have a much better chance realising his ambition in Hamburg where his uncle lives.\"I want to become a doctor in Germany and to make visits to Syria and treat people for free, so I will help Syria and also help Germany,\u201d he said. Sam's family have prepared the necessary documentation and are ready to leave their war ravaged country.His older brother, Ajam, wants to play football in Germany, but Syria is his home and he does have some misgivings about leaving.\"For sure, our homeland is like our mother, one will certainly miss his homeland,\u201d said Ajam. I'm going to develop myself and become successful, and when I succeed, I will come back to Syria to build something here, to do something for my homeland.\"About a million refugees are expected to have arrived in Germany by the end of 2015. Despite the cold autumn weather, thousands are still trekking across the Balkans and entering Germany via the Austrian border. Asser Khattab is a talented 21-year-old blogger and media student at Damascus University. Most of his friends have left and are already in Europe.\"The European culture is loved here in Syria,\u201d said Asser. \u201cThey like Germany; they like the way that Germans think and work, and they like their attitudes.\"But the German authorities are increasingly overwhelmed after having processed so many refugees. And even those who initially supported Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to welcome the refugees are now voicing concern that the numbers are simply too high.From the European perspective, the refugee crisis is really only affecting them now. But in \"ground zero\" in Syria, the exodus has been tearing families apart for almost five years. Today, not a single Syrian has been left unaffected by this war.

The mission had been a success, she said.\"This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,\" May said in a statement made from her country residence at Chequers just minutes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the strikes from the White House.May later told reporters in her Downing Street office that the Western missiles struck a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks.By launching strikes without prior approval from parliament, May dispensed with a non-binding constitutional convention dating back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She said speed was essential and that military action was in the national interest.\"It was both right and legal to take military action,\" May said, adding that she would update parliament on Monday.The Western missile strikes demonstrate the volatile nature of the Syrian civil war, which started in March 2011 as an anti-Assad uprising but is now a proxy conflict involving a number of world and regional powers and a myriad of insurgent groups.Assad, May said, should not doubt the resolve of Britain, France and the United States but made clear that the strike was a specific response to the Douma attack which killed up to 75 people, including children.May dismissed as \"grotesque and absurd\" a claim by Russia, which intervened in the war in 2015 to back Assad, that the Douma attack was staged by Britain. But she declined to give any signal about the future of Assad.\"RIGHT AND LEGAL\"May referred specifically to last month's nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English cathedral city of Salisbury that she has blamed on Russia. Moscow has denied any involvement.\"We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised \u2013 either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere,\" May told reporters in Downing Street.She said almost a century of global acceptance about not using chemical weapons had been eroded in Douma and Salisbury.May said Britain and its allies had sought to use every diplomatic means to stop the use of chemical weapons, but had been repeatedly thwarted, citing a Russian veto of an independent investigation into the Douma attack at the U.N. Security Council this week.\"So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,\" she said.BOMBS DON'T BRING PEACEThe small Northern Irish political party that props up her government said May was justified in taking such action though it said wider intervention in Syria would be counter-productive.However, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a fervent anti-war campaigner, called the strikes \"legally questionable\" and said May should have recalled parliament from a holiday and \"not trailed after Donald Trump\".\"Bombs won\u2019t save lives or bring about peace,\" he said. \"Britain should be playing a leadership role to bring about a ceasefire in the conflict, not taking instructions from Washington and putting British military personnel in harm's way.\"Many politicians in Britain, including some in May's own Conservative Party, had backed his call for parliament to give the authority for any military strike.A YouGov poll for The Times newspaper this week indicated that only a fifth of voters believed that Britain should launch attacks on Syrian military targets and 43 percent opposed action.Former Prime Minister David Cameron lost a parliamentary vote on air strikes against Assad's forces in 2013 when 30 Conservative lawmakers voted against action, with many Britons wary of entering another conflict after intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region.Cameron, though, gave his support of May on Saturday.\"As we have seen in the past, inaction has its consequences,\" he said.(Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill and William James; Writing by Michael Holden and Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Angus MacSwan and Peter Graff)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "China says it will make efforts on Syria reconstruction", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "\n                                China hopes Syria can show \"flexibility\" in promoting peace talks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday in a meeting with an adviser to Syria's president, adding that China would help with its reconstruction.BEIJING: China hopes Syria can show \"flexibility\" in promoting peace talks, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday in a meeting with an adviser to Syria's president, adding that China would help with its reconstruction.Syria's six-year-old civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two and embroiled regional and world powers.For years, Western and Arab countries backed an opposition demand that President Bashar al-Assad quit power, but since Russia's 2015 entry into the war, his government has won back major cities and now looks militarily unassailable.Leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran agreed on Wednesday to help support a full-scale political process in Syria and announced an agreement to sponsor a conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to try to end the war.Syria is looking chiefly to Russia, China and Iran for help with reconstruction. Western states say recovery and reconstruction support for Syria depends on \"a credible political process leading to a genuine political transition that can be supported by a majority of the Syrian people\".Wang told Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior aide to Assad visiting China, that engagement over the future of Syria's political arrangements had intensified, and that he believed it would contribute to a formal peace process talks in Geneva.\"China hopes the Syrian side can seize the opportunity, display flexibility, and promote dialogue and negotiation to achieve substantive results,\" Wang said, according to a statement from China's foreign ministry.\"The international community should emphasize and actively support Syria's reconstruction.

The Syrian army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces fought the Islamic State separately in Raqqa province this year, driving out IS from its main stronghold in Syria. (Xinhua/Ammar Safarjalani)by Hummam Sheikh AliDAMASCUS, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- The major achievement for Syria in 2017 was perhaps the defeat of the Islamic State (IS), a development that nourishes hopes and paves the way for a possible political solution to the nearly seven-year-old civil war in 2018, after several setbacks in the course of negotiations.FALL OF ISOn Oct. 17, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by the U.S., fully captured the northern city of Raqqa, almost three years after the terrorist group declared the city as the capital of its self-styled caliphate in Syria.It took the SDF four months to defeat the IS in Raqqa, with the heavy backing of the U.S.-led anti-terror coalition.According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor group, 3,250 people, including 1,130 civilians, were killed during the four-month intense battles in Raqqa.The London-based watchdog also said 80 percent of Raqqa was destroyed owing to the heavy bombing by both the SDF and the U.S.-led coalition.In tandem with the SDF's attacks on Raqqa, the Russian-backed Syrian army was making strides in the battles against IS militants in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour, which boasts key oil and gas fields and was thus deemed as the economic capital of the IS.On Nov. 3, the Syrian army declared the liberation of the entire city of Deir al-Zour from the IS, after months of battles in the capital city that bears the same name with the province.The army later defeated the IS in two key strongholds in the countryside of Deir al-Zour Province, namely the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal along the Iraqi border.To reach Deir al-Zour, the Syrian government forces with the backing of pro-government fighters, and the Lebanese group of Hezbollah launched a wide-scale military offensive in the Syrian Desert in the remote eastern countryside of Homs Province in central Syria.The campaign started in May and initially focused on eliminating rebel threats along the highway from the capital Damascus to the border with Iraq.Its first goal was to capture both the highway and the al-Tanf border crossing, thus securing the Damascus countryside from a potential rebel attack.Later, multiple other fronts were opened throughout the desert, in addition to the anti-IS operation \"Grand Dawn\" which aimed to reopen the Damascus-Palmyra highway and prepare for an offensive toward Deir al-Zour.Along the way in the desert toward Deir al-Zour, the army recaptured Palmyra and other key IS strongholds.During the offensive in the desert, key gas and oil plants, including the Hayyan gas fields, the largest production facility of gas feeding electricity stations in central and southern Syria, were recaptured from the IS.The series of operations stripped the IS of its political and economic strongholds, so that the eradication of its remnants in the countryside of Deir al-Zour is just a matter of time.TENSION BETWEEN GOV'T AND KURDSIn the meantime, the Kurdish-led SDF was also attacking the IS in the northern countryside of Deir al-Zour, yet with different aims.The Syrian army's aim was to get all the areas captured by the IS back to the government control, while the U.S.-backed SDF was to consolidate its presence to realize its old dream of establishing an autonomy in Syria.There was no military or political confrontation between them at first.The Kurdish-led groups, however, repeatedly accused the government forces of targeting their areas, while the Syrian government refused to acknowledge the liberation of Raqqa, saying the city was occupied by the U.S. and Kurdish forces.Syrian officials repeatedly said the government will regain all lost areas, including those under the Kurdish control, while Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said Kurdish autonomy was not non-negotiable.On Dec. 20, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad described the SDF as \"new Daesh (IS),\" saying the SDF should be a part of Syria.The sharp comments came as the government perceives the Kurdish activities as separatist, despite the repeated remarks from the Kurds that they were not seeking independence.PROSPECT OF POLITICAL SETTLEMENTWhile the war on terror was successful in 2017, the wheels of political solution were moving slowly, as no concrete ground has been agreed on despite rounds of intra-Syrian talks in Geneva.The latest round of talks ended earlier this month, where the opposition renewed its stance that President Bashar al-Assad should leave as a prelude to the political solution, while the government maintained that no preconditions should be set ahead of the talks, and tried to give priority to counter-terrorism.On Dec. 14, UN envoy Staffan de Mistura warned against the repercussion of the failure of the eighth round of the Geneva talks.He said two weeks of talks failed to yield the intended results despite great efforts, which he described as a \"missed golden opportunity.\"In parallel with the Geneva talks were several rounds of talks in Astana, which were supported by Russia, Turkey and Iran. The Astana talks achieved the de-escalation zones deal for the cease-fire in four major hotspots in Syria.The first zone includes parts of the northwestern province of Idlib, as well as parts of the countryside of Latakia Province in northwestern Syria, western areas of Aleppo Province in northern Syria and northern areas of Hama Province in central Syria.The second zone includes Eastern Ghouta countryside of the capital Damascus, while the third one includes the towns of Rastan and Talbiseh in the northern countryside of Homs Province in central Syria.The fourth zone includes areas in the southern provinces of Daraa and Qunaitera.Eyes are now shifted toward the upcoming talks in Sochi brokered by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, particularly after the visit of Assad to Sochi last month and the visit of Putin to Syria this month.These visits were seen by analysts as paving a strong way for the Sochi talks, which are scheduled for early next year.On Dec. 18, Assad said his administration welcomes any role of the UN in possible Syrian elections as long as it respects the Syrian sovereignty, according to the Syrian presidential media office.The elections and constitution in Syria are expected to be discussed in the upcoming talks in Sochi.Assad said if there is a constitutional amendment, there will be elections based on it.After the most dangerous terror group Syria has ever known is collapsing in 2017, the best hope in 2018 should be that a better agreement could be reached to pave a stronger way for the final political solution.

Dusts were wiped off their images, while the face of the 65-year-old man was filled with sorrow, revealing his everlasting innermost grief.Deeb's house was in the rebel-held part during the battles. A rocket shell that slammed his three-storey house killed his wife and son, yet he survived with wounds in his head.\"Me, my wife and kids were still asleep when something slammed our building. I didn't know what it was at the time, but I lost my wife and son,\" he told Xinhua at the shattered entrance of his house.Despite the great loss and misfortune, Deeb said his faith was strong and he would never leave his home, which needs to be rebuilt from scratch. The house is like a shattered box filled with memories of his beloved ones that he would never be able to get over.\"I will not leave, where should I go? I will clean it and even if I had to stay in it like this, I will stay. This is my house, the fruit of my entire life and hard work,\" he said, choking back the tears.Houses in other neighborhoods in eastern Aleppo were all under the same condition. Zakariah Akeed, a man in his 60s, lived right next door.Akeed also lost two floors of his apartment building, but he was fortunate enough that none of his family members got hurt since they fled the neighborhood when the rebels took over in 2012. Now the man has returned and started fixing his house with two of his sons.\"I was happy that I came back, but when I saw the amount of destruction my brain was boiling. We started fixing what could be fixed but the restoration costs lots of money. That's why we put the reparation on hold,\" Akeed said he would still stay even though with no electricity and shortage of water.One of his son, Muhammad, said he goes to sleep every day after praying that the house would not collapse over their heads, as the cracks in the wall and the sinking parts of the house all indicate that it could fall down at any minute.\"I left here before the rebels took over and returned to find it badly damaged, and frankly I don't know how to fix this home. I hope I can get some help to rebuild it,\" he said.This is just one of the cases of all the families who started to return.

recent news reports suggest that Turkey may be seeking to create a Sunni-ruled area in Syria near its border, analysts warned against such a move on the grounds that it would invite trouble and lead to a confrontation with both Russia and the United States.Should Turkey attempt such a thing, it would be forcefully driven out of Syria, cautioned Haldun Solmazturk, a former general with the Turkish military. \"Russia would not accept a Sunni state-like entity under heavy Turkish sway,\" he told Xinhua.Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency reported last Saturday that around 30 sub-groups of the Ankara-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group had united under the name of Syria's \"national army,\" which has 22,000 soldiers in three corps and includes three brigades composed of Syrian Turkmens.Jawad Abu Hatab, head of the so-called Syria's interim government, was quoted as saying that their main objective was to keep the areas captured by Turkish troops in Syria and defend people there against the Syrian government and terrorist organizations.The Turkish military, backed by FSA rebels, launched a so-called Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria from August 2016 to March 2017, seizing several towns in its efforts to drive the Islamic State away and prevent the Kurdish cantons from uniting along the Turkish border.\"Turkey has neither the military nor economic or political power to keep part of Syrian territory in hand,\" argued Solmazturk, who chairs the Incek debates at the Ankara-based 21st Century Turkey Institute.The indications suggest that Turkey intends to carve out a Sunni-held area in Syria and exercise control over it through the FSA, he said.Numan Kurtulmus, then Turkish government spokesman, said about a year ago that Ankara would not hand over the territory seized by Turkish military to the Syrian government.Roughly until the end of 2015, Turkey and the U.S. not only supported rebels in Syria, but also trained and equipped FSA militants in Turkey to topple the Syrian government.Haitham Ofeisi, chief of General Staff of the so-called \"national army,\" said the decision to establish the armed group was made with Ankara's support.Syrian troops and terrorist groups would be cleared from the area and more \"national army\" troops would be formed in the areas to be liberated in the future, Ofeisi was quoted as saying by Anadolu.The pro-government Yeni Safak daily said on Monday that the \"national army\" would also help Turkish troops drive Kurdish militia forces out of Afrin in northwestern Syria.Top Turkish officials have repeatedly expressed Ankara's determination to cleanse the Kurdish militia, known as the People's Protection Units and seen by Turkey as terrorists, from Afrin and other areas along the Turkish border.Turkey's move against Afrin and other cantons held by Syrian militia would face opposition not only from the Syrian government but also from both Russia and the U.S. as well, Faruk Logoglu, a former senior Turkish diplomat, told Xinhua.For Solmazturk, a Turkish operation against Afrin with the support of the \"national army\" would amount to madness. \"Both the U.S. and Russia would surely oppose that and clashes would break out,\" he said.Until the summer of 2016, when Ankara started to mend ties with Moscow, a staunch supporter of Damascus in the Syrian civil war, Turkey supported Sunni rebel groups fighting to topple the Syrian government headed by President Bashar al-Assad.Joining hands with Russia and Iran to broker a Syrian peace deal since last summer, Ankara has given up trying to oust al-Assad but kept saying he must leave.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suddenly raised his voice against al-Assad last week, calling him a terrorist. Accusing al-Assad of carrying out state terrorism in the war, Erdogan said the Syrian leader should not be allowed to remain in power.\"The deeper problem is that the Turkish government still lacks a consistent, steady Syria policy of its own,\" said Logoglu. \"It vacillates between Russia and the U.S., between its commitment to Syria's territorial integrity and its wish to exercise long-term control through proxies over parts of Syria.\"Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem accused Ankara last month of having designs on Syria's territory, while Damascus sees the presence of Turkish troops on Syrian soil as occupation.The \"al-Assad must go\" attitude assumed by the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey is in line with the U.S. position, though Ankara says \"no\" to Washington's military support to the Kurdish militia in Syria.Arguing Turkey's vacillating policy in Syria has worked to its detriment, Logoglu said, \"Turkey's policy should be to support a single Syria, with one flag, one army. Otherwise, Turkey is likely to face further isolation regarding Syria.\" Xi stresses real combat trainingSnowfall seen in parts of ChinaNew York City to install 1,500 security barriersAt least 9 injured in storm Eleanor in ParisPLA takes over flag-raising duty at Tian'anmen Square on New Year's DayMajor work of world's longest sea bridge completedIntangible cultural heritage exhibition held in Puyuan, east ChinaInternational ice sculpture competition held in NE China's Harbin"}{"head": "\nSyria no longer tolerates Israeli attacks by downing its fighter jet in reprisal\n", "classes": ["firP", "firP"], "content": "A picture taken on February 10, 2018, shows the remains of a missile that crashed earlier in Alonei Abba, east of Haifa, in northernIsrael.

Yahya Suleiman, an expert in the strategic military fields, told Xinhua that as early as the second half of 2017, a strategic decision was made that any Israeli attacks will be retaliated instantly.\"The Israelis have only admitted the targeting of one warplane but the truth is that many warplanes were hit during today's confrontation,\" he said.Suleiman, however, said he doesn't think the situation will escalate toward a full-fledged war, citing the internal crisis of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who could face trial on corruption charges.Additionally, Israel knows that Syria or Hezbollah will not be alone in any confrontation because the \"Axis of Resistance,\" which includes Iran, Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah, will unite in facing any Israeli threat to any part of the axis, the Syrian general noted.Israel itself doesn't seem ready to escalate the situation.An Israeli military spokesman said on Saturday that his country does not seek an escalation in the region.\"We are willing, prepared and capable to exact a heavy price from anyone that attacks us.

Yet even after the Islamic State extremists were defeated in the country, the fighting between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russia, and the rebels, supported by the US, has continued.A hasty military strike against the Assad regime would increase the possibility of what has been a shadow clash between Washington and Moscow turning into a head-on confrontation.The two countries should try harder to avoid such a scenario from coming true because it will further aggravate the situation in Syria and only create fertile ground for extremist organizations. And combating terrorists was the professed reason the two countries became involved in the Syrian civil war.The US leader should, in particular, restrain his penchant for warmongering rhetoric, especially since his country\u2019s military action in neighboring Iraq is responsible for having sparked the current chaos in the Middle East. And in recent years, other countries in the region besides Syria have become mired in conflict and social instability because of the US\u2019 interventionist policy.Experience shows diplomacy is still the best option for defusing a crisis such as the one in Syria. The United States should think twice before plunging the region deeper into bloodshed and conflict, and take a step back to reappraise its policy toward the Middle East.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "Strikes on Syria set a bad example in world politics", "classes": [], "content": "The military strikes the United States and its allies launched against government targets in Syria set a very bad example, circumventing the United Nations and making such military actions an option the world's superpower can use any time it wants against any country it doesn't like.The excuse was a chemical weapons attack on the town of Douma, which the Syrian government has repeatedly denied, with the strikes launched immediately before a fact-finding mission by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was about to begin. Why did the US and its allies not wait until the investigation yields a result?It reminds us of what happened to Iraq in 2003 when the United States invaded the country claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found, and the war led to the protracted turmoil in Iraq and the rise of the Islamic State group. For that war, the United States and its allies owe the Iraqi people and the world an apology.It is Syria this time, a country that entered its eighth year of war in March. Nothing is more urgent than political stability and national reconciliation for this country. At the time when the Syrian government forces have gained the upper hand in the civil war, there seems no reason for it to use chemical weapons to provoke the United States and its allies, which have long been considering the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.Given the complexity of the situation in Syria, the military strikes will only make it even more difficult for the parties involved to work out a peaceful solution and for the country to emerge from war.The arbitrary and abrupt military action by the United States and its allies will likely complicate the possibility of political solutions to the settlement of other hotspot issues. Its spillover effects will have an impact on the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula, in which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will have reason to consider the possession of nuclear weapons as the sole guarantee for it to avert such military strikes by the United States and its allies.It is a pity that the Security Council of the United Nations on Saturday failed to adopt a resolution to condemn the airstrikes.

The cohesion and integrity of two major countries, not just one, is in question.The following six points can chart a principled and integrated way forward.First, ending the violence. It is irresponsible for foreign powers to give continued military support to parties in Syria that are committing atrocities and flagrantly violating fundamental principles of human rights and international law. I have urged the Security Council to impose an arms embargo. The sides will have to sit across from each other again at the negotiating table. How many more people must die before they get there?Second, protecting people. The UN continues to manage a huge humanitarian relief effort. But the government continues to impose unconscionable access restrictions; it has removed medical supplies from aid convoys and deliberately starved and collectively punished communities it regards as sympathetic to the opposition. Some rebel groups have acted similarly. Moreover, the international community has provided barely a third of the funding needed for the relief effort. I continue to appeal for an end to the sieges and for unfettered humanitarian access across internal frontlines and international borders.Third, starting a serious political process. The warring parties systematically blocked the relentless initiatives of two of the world's leading diplomats, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and former UN and Arab League special envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi. The presidential election earlier this month was a further blow, and failed to meet even minimal standards for credible voting. I will soon name a new special envoy to Syria to pursue a political solution and a transition to a new Syria. Regional countries have a special responsibility to help end this war. I welcome recent contacts between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hope that they will build confidence and reverse a destructive competition in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere. Syrian civil society groups are making courageous efforts to maintain the fabric of society and keep open channels of solidarity and communication.\nI've been thinking about writing an article to summarize my life in the past year, 2014, and I saw the topic popping out yesterday.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss closed-door deliberations.\nA Jordanian soldier gives food and water to Syrian children refugees after they crossed the border from Syria, near Mafraq Feb 18, 2013. [Photo/Agencies]That view was bolstered by a new report on Monday by a UN-appointed panel that said Syria's civil war is becoming increasingly sectarian and the behavior of both sides is growing more and more radicalized. The report urged the international community to curb the supply of weapons, and anti-government forces to part with foreign fighters.Several foreign ministers said they were placing their hopes on the mediation efforts of Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint UN-Arab League envoy to Syria.\"There is no shortage of arms in Syria,\" Luxembourgish Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said. \"With more arms, there are more killed, more atrocities.\"The UN says nearly 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict since March 2011.\"We are convinced that a lifting of the weapons embargo would not be reasonable,\" said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. \"This would only lead to a new arms race in Syria. This would mean a further escalation of violence with many, many more victims.\"The British Foreign and Commonwealth office said in a statement that its objective remains a diplomatic solution. But the statement did not explicitly confirm or deny that the UK wanted the embargo altered to get arms to the rebels.\"The UK believes international action so far has fallen short,\" it said. \"In the absence of a diplomatic breakthrough, it is right that we continue to consider all options to protect civilians and to assist the National Coalition and other opposition groups opposed to extremism.\"Despite the violence, diplomatic efforts continue. Mouaz al-Khatib, the president of the opposition coalition, has said he would negotiate with representatives of Syria's governing party - though not with Assad or members of his security services. Brahimi, the international envoy, says that offer \"challenges the Syrian government to fulfill its often repeated assertion that it is ready for dialogue and a peaceful settlement\". The report released in Geneva on Monday by the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria made for alarming reading.The commission, set up by the UN Human Rights Council, hasn't been able to enter the country and said that \"significantly limited\" its ability to investigate all alleged abuses - particularly those committed by armed anti-government groups. The report was based on 445 interviews with victims and witnesses.\"The war has become colored by sectarianism, permeated by opportunistic criminality and aggravated by the presence of foreign fighters and extremist groups,\" the panel said.It said the number of foreigners fighting in the conflict has increased but still accounts for \"a small proportion\" of anti-government groups - though it remains hard to assess with accuracy their numbers.It added that foreign fighters appear to come from countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, \"many from Libya, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt\". It urged anti-Assad groups to \"detach themselves from the foreign fighters, particularly extreme elements that fail to comply with international human rights and humanitarian law\".The commission also found that the civil war \"is becoming more militarized because of the proliferation of weapons and types of weapons used\", with arms and ammunition smuggled across Syria's borders to anti-government groups on an increasingly regular basis.It said government forces have increasingly used cluster munitions, but there was \"no credible evidence\" of either side using chemical weapons.The panel also said it will submit a new, confidential list of Syrians suspected of committing crimes against humanity in the country's civil war to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, next month.\u00a0"}{"head": "China looks to mediate Syria's civil war", "classes": ["Txt14", "timesTxt", "Txt14", "timesTxt", "Txt14", "timesTxt", "center", "foot-info", "center", "foot-info"], "content": "Foreign minister Wang Yi urged opposition parties in Syria to participate in peace dialogues and negotiations without any preconditions when he met with a leader from the Syrian opposition force in Beijing on Thursday.The meeting with President of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces Alptekin Hocaoglu came just two weeks after Beijing hosted the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem.Observers see Beijing\u2019s engagement with both the Syrian government and the oppositions as a more active mediation role for conflict issues in the Middle East.A civil war broke out five years ago in the oil-rich country and has since turned the nation into a war-torn land with increasing terrorism forces.The UN Security Council unanimously agreed on a resolution last month, which calls for Syria peace talks to begin in early January.It also calls for a nationwide cease-fire in Syria to come into effect \"as soon as the representatives of the Syrian government and the opposition have begun initial steps towards a political transition under UN auspices\".While meeting with Alptekin Hocaoglu, Wang urged opposition parties in Syria to support the UN\u2019s peace effort and \"participate in relevant talks and negotiations without preconditions\".As a representative of the Syrian opposition parties, the National Coalition can adopt measures that are more positive to help bring a ceasefire and coordinate with the UN\u2019s efforts, Wang said.China has been pushing for peace and dialogues in Middle East issues, insisting that the primary judgment to solving those problems focuses on whether it will bring peace and happiness for the people there, Wang said, adding that China will continue to offer more humanitarian aid for Syria. Alptekin Hocaoglu arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a four-day visit.He was quoted in a Foreign Ministry press statement saying that his coalition is ready to participate in the UN-led dialogue without any precondition, and advocate that the Syria government and oppositions should take measures to build trust gradually, and solve all problems through dialogue and negotiation.He said he hopes China will play a bigger role in pushing for the political solution of the Syrian issue.China has actively participated in international mediations to draw opposition parties in Syria to the negotiating table ever since the civil war broke out five years ago.China announced that it would extend an additional 40 million yuan ($6.06 million) in humanitarian aid to Syria while hosting visiting Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, who arrived in December.Wang Mingming, a researcher of the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the efforts China has been making to bring a negotiation shows the country is playing a more constructive role in addressing Middle East Issues than before. Both the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition parties believe that China has a \"relatively equitable\" stance in the Syrian issue due to its \"detached\" position. Wang said, adding that he is optimistic that China will help address the issue.Former Chinese special envoy on the Middle East issues Wu Sike said the willingness to negotiate between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition parties shows that the international community has realized military measures cannot solve problems, and the most urgent issue now is to work together to fight terrorism.\"China has long been expressing its stance of addressing the Syrian issue through political solutions, and its effort to talk it through to both the Syrian government and opposition parties has paid off,\" Wu said.

The US, British and French air strikes on three Syrian sites on April 14, claiming they are associated with the Syrian government forces' alleged chemical attack in Douma in eastern Ghouta, was without any justification of international law or authorization of the UN Security Council. The West has done it before, in Iraq and Libya for instance, and may do it again.In the case of Iraq, the West's claim that Saddam Hussein possessed \"weapons of mass destruction\" was at best, totally false or at worst, beautifully fabricated. In Libya's case, the West managed to convince Russia and China that its mission was to supply \"humanitarian aid\" to the people of Libya so the two countries abstained from a Security Council resolution on a \"no fly zone\".But Moscow and Beijing were soon shocked to see the West launch a NATO mission to overthrow the Muammar Gadhafi regime.In the latest attack on Syria, the Western powers were cautious enough not to hit any Russian or Iranian military sites there to avoid a direct retaliation by Moscow. But by carrying the attack in the first place, the West ignored prior warnings by Russia that it would respond in kind if its military sites were attacked.This signifies a disturbing Western strategic trend which, if allowed to continue, could spark what many fear could be \"World War III\".In fact, with US President Donald Trump now insisting on \"renegotiating\" the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987 to eliminate all nuclear and conventional missiles with ranges of 500-1,000 kilometers and 1,000-5,500 km, and Moscow saying it will abide by the treaty as long as Washington continues do the same, fears of a post-Cold War nuclear arms race seem increasingly real, in which a political clash or an accidental targeting error, as Richard Falk, professor emeritus of International Law at Princeton University, put it, could cause a catastrophic humanitarian and geopolitical crisis.Or, did the three Western powers launch the strikes on Syria to turn the attention of their people from more important and immediate domestic issues? Trump's presidential approval rating is at one of its lowest, he is locked in a difficult trade dispute with China and his popularity among even US allies is very low. Britain is facing problems on many fronts, the foremost being Brexit. And France has been tackling one domestic crisis after another, from terrorist attacks to labor reforms and farmers' subsidies.That the West carried out the strikes without any evidence that Bashar al-Assad had indeed ordered the so-called chemical attacks, and that too at a time when he seems to be winning the civil war against the rebels, tells another story. Some even claim the rushed attack was, in fact, launched to eliminate any evidence that the rebels or other terrorist outfits, not the Syrian government, was involved in the chemical attack especially because the Organization for the Protection of Chemical Weapons is yet to start its fact-finding mission into the Douma incident.Given its apparent attempt to prevent the Assad government from eliminating the remaining Islamic terrorists in Syria, the West's tall claims of fighting global terrorism for the global common good ring hollow. Western powers have not learned any lesson from the destruction of Iraq, or their failure in Afghanistan to root out terrorists.Perhaps they believe they stand to gain more economically and politically if the civil wars continue in the Middle East countries. Call it the politics of \"creative destruction\", if you will. It's comforting to know therefore that there are still some countries that do not say one thing, and do exactly the opposite.But as the world continues to play its political and strategic games, more sufferings pile up on the Syrian people.The author is a senior editor with China Daily.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          Protests in US cities after airstrikes on Syria\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "May faces backlash British Prime Minister Theresa May faced a backlash from the domestic opposition after launching military strikes on Syria without consulting parliament.As the Conservative leader explained her rationale for the air strikes, opposition parties claimed the attacks were legally dubious, risked escalating conflict and should have been approved by lawmakers.The shadow of the 2003 invasion of Iraq still lingers in the corridors of Britain's parliament, when MPs backed then-prime minister Tony Blair in joining US military action.\"Bombs won't save lives or bring about peace,\" said Jeremy Corbyn, the veteran leftist leader of the main opposition Labour Party.\"This legally questionable action risks escalating further... an already devastating conflict.\"Theresa May should have sought parliamentary approval, not trailed after Donald Trump.\"Corbyn has written to May seeking assurance that there would be no further bombing raids and urged the government to negotiate a pause in the Syrian civil war.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": " Russia, China veto draft UN resolution on Syrian civil war", "classes": ["Txt14", "timesTxt", "Txt14", "timesTxt", "Txt14", "timesTxt", "center", "foot-info", "center", "foot-info"], "content": "\nSyria's UN Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari (R) speaks to Russia's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council at the UN headquarters in New York, May 22, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]\nRussia, China veto draft UN resolution on Syrian civil warThe unadopted draft resolution, proposed by France, received 13 votes in favor and two against.\"The draft resolution has not been adopted owing to the negative votes of permanent members of the council,\" said Oh Joon, the South Korean permanent representative to the United Nations, who holds the rotating council presidency for the month of May.The Thursday vote at the 15-nation UN body made it a fourth double veto by Russia and China on a West-drafted resolution on Syria.Syria is not a state party to the Rome Statute which established the ICC, so the only way the Middle East country can be referred to The Hague-based tribunal is by the Security Council.Under the UN Charter, the adoption of a draft resolution requires nine votes in favor and the absence of a negative vote by any of the five permanent members of the Security Council.France, another permanent council member, circulated the draft resolution among the council members on May 12 in a bid to refer the Syrian civil war, current in its fourth year, to the ICC for review of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\"The Security Council reaffirms its strong condemnation of the widespread violations of human rights law by the Syrian authorities and pro-government militias, as well as the human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by non-State armed groups, all committed in the course of the ongoing conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011,\" said the draft resolution.After the council vote, Vitaly Churkin, the Russian UN ambassador, said at the Security Council that the vetoed draft resolution, if adopted, would \"lay the ground for the eventual outside military intervention\" in Syria.Churkin blamed France, which initiated the draft resolution, for trying once again to \"create a pretext for armed intervention in the Syrian conflict,\" while \"fully aware of the failure it will meet\" in the wake of the council vote.\"It is striking that there is not a single word on the political settlement and the negotiation process among the Syrians \" mentioned in a communique at the end of the May 15 meeting on Syria in London, he said.Citing the case of Libya, Churkin said the referral to the ICC would not help resolve the crisis.The Security Council has previously referred Libya and Sudan's Darfur to the ICC.\"We call on our Western colleagues to abandon the futile, dead-end policy on Syria,\" he said.\"We share their emotions caused by the crisis in Syria, which has been dragging on for far too long,\" Churkin said, referring to the countries sponsoring the draft resolutions.Russia has already voiced its opposition to the referral of Syria to the ICC. On Wednesday, Churkin called a \"public stunt\" the planned council vote.The Geneva communique, issued in June 2012 on the principles of accountability and national reconciliation in Syria, will continue to serve as the basis for \"the core efforts\" to strive for the political solution to the Syrian crisis, he said. \"We are convinced that the justice in Syria will eventually prevail.\"\"Those guilty of perpetrating grave crimes will be punished,\" he said. \"But in order for this to happen, peace is first needed, first and foremost.\"\nThe quest to find, lure and keep talent goes on and onAfter 145 years, Chinese railroad workers honored at lastCipher this: Chinese novel explores cryptography's labyrinthLearning to warm up to and love China, with a claw-hammer banjo on her kneeTerritorial disputes in the South China SeaPremier Li visits African countriesRoyals who have visited ChinaCopyright 1995 - \n\n\n<!--\nvar oTime = new Date();\ndocument.write(oTime.getFullYear());\n-->\n2018\n\n .

How? By waging war? No, it is\u00a0far more insidious.Take a look at the last 25 years and the wars that the USA has fought to \"bring democracy\" or \"regime change\", and a simple pattern emerges.The ruling party, if against Israel, is making progress in a country free from the influence of Jewish central banks. Israel convinces the US and it\u2019s gullible allies that this prospering country is ruled by an evil government hell-bent on manufacturing chemical or nuclear weapons etc. Sanctions follow, after which the government of the targeted country agrees to destroy its defensive capabilities based on assurances that sanctions will be lifted and the government will be treated fairly.You can see where this is going... once the weapons are destroyed, Israel convinces its allies using Jewish owned media in the West, that the regime that trusted them is cruel and needs to be changed on \"humanitarian grounds\", thus an internal civil war is sparked or a false flag is staged attacking the US or its allies, orchestrated by Israel and blamed as\u00a0the scapegoat of the day.Does this sound\u00a0unbelievable? Let\u2019s take a look at the regimes that have been changed under this pretext, Egypt, Libya, Iraq.\u00a0All of them had a few things in common: the means to defend themselves against Israel, freedom from\u00a0Jewish-owned banking, and stable governments making progress in their countries.All of them were disarmed with promises of support, after which they were\u00a0overthrown by instigating and funding civil war, and where civil war was impossible, simply attacked.Those who trusted the US and its allies were deposed and sometimes executed in public (e.g. Moammar Gaddafi, who was making Libya an advanced state with free healthcare, education and warned of the current \"refugee crisis\" if Libya was destabilized).Once the government was disarmed and then deposed and it\u2019s leaders executed, a Jewish controlled central bank was quickly established and the gold reserves\u00a0flown out of them. Case in point, the Ukrainian civil war:\u00a0the moment they got control of part of Ukraine that Russia did not reclaim, they established a central bank and flew out the gold reserves under cover of darkness (a quick google search will verify this).Now, if you look at the map of the Middle East you see the influence and borders of Israel growing, always following this same plan, Syria was the next target, demonize Assad, instigate civil war, frame it as a \"humanitarian emergency\" and fund the breakup of a stable country to strengthen Israel.BUT! never do it directly but through funding and arming \"freedom fighters\" and making your allies defend \"the poor children\" etc etc.\u00a0Russia finally stepped in after seeing the debacle and brazen stupidity and repeat of the Iraq, Egypt strategy in Libya. With president Trump reluctant to fight\u00a0Israeli wars, finally Israel had to (gasp!) come to the forefront and attack Syria under the guise of attacking Iran. At the time of writing this article Israel has bombed Syria 100+ times just in 2017. Next up is Iran.\u00a0But their insidious warfare plans have been thwarted by a smart Russia. Itself having suffered under Jewish torture and extermination of some 50 million Christians by the Bolsheviks\u00a0in the Holodomor.Now Israel is seething and planning all kinds of false flags to get the US and the UK and France to be good little lapdogs and save the \"poor Syrians\" while quietly exporting most of the internal Syrian terrorists to Sweden and Europe.But wait! there\u2019s more! Just because Israel lost Syria doesn\u2019t mean they'll back off.\u00a0Israelis and Jews are not that\u00a0simple.Israel has been funding a proxy war in Yemen as well. The typical Israeli strategy is straight out of the Communist Manifesto, constant war, forever, fought by others.\u00a0So now in Yemen they have an image issue. The Yemeni government is fully under Israeli control and the \"rebels\" are the nationalists trying to take their nation back. In Syria, Israel\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0rebels were good people totally not financed by Israel, the US and Mossad-Pentagon. The Syria debacle ended up costing the US about $1 trillion.No problem, says the think tank in Tel Aviv. We\u2019ll just frame the Houthi rebel\u2019s as \"terrorists\" and the Yemen government as under siege.\u00a0No one will notice this flip-flop. Don\u2019t believe it? Just go to google and type Yemen and see how they have framed this conflict.And, notice another thing, Israel is not in the picture, it\u2019s making Saudi Arabia fight this war.If you want to see where the next flashpoint is, after Syria, look to Yemen. Iran is too formidable a foe to move against just yet and especially after the humiliating defeat in Syria.A million more words could be written about this, but this is just a primer to make you realize how Israel sets up its own empire not directly but by attacking its friends, blaming the attack on the countries Israel wants to destroy, making their\u00a0friends fight Israeli wars and then helping things by instigating civil war inside these nations.Once you understand this simple formula, the next time you see a headline shrieking about \"humanitarian crisis in anti-Israel-land\" you will know exactly what is going on, who is funding it and most importantly, the question that answers all...cui bono?\u00a0This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone. - Rod Serling\u00a0The Twilight Zone is also where the president of Turkey lives, or at least one would think so.In an absolutely outrageous scene, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan actually blamed Russia - publicly - for the deaths of up to 400,000 people in Syria over the course of the last five years.This amazing statement comes from a man who more than any other party on earth is directly responsible for the ISIS horror show that has tormented, defiled, and butchered a once-peaceful nation to further his own insidious 'Neo-Ottoman' objectives.While visiting his counterpart in Senegal this week, and ostensibly with a straight face, the Turkish tyrant stated that,\u00a0' Russia must be held accountable for the people it has killed within Syria's borders. By cooperatiing with the regime, the number of people they have killed has reached 400,000.'Erdogan for some reason forgot to mention that he was directly responsible for facilitating the flow of ISIS terrorists into Syria from countries all over the world and arming them to the teeth in order to wage an unholy war on a peaceful neighbor whose greatest crime against him was a desire to be his friend.He also forgot to mention that he was directly responsible for\u00a0committing the heinous war crime\u00a0of gassing Syrian civilians in order to manipulate Obama's idiotic 'red line' remarks about the use of chemical weapons.\u00a0\u00a0He also forgot to mention how his son was directly responsible for running\u00a0a smuggling operation that transported hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars of stolen Syrian oil that he sold to the Israelis and which served as the main source of funding for the greatest terror group in world history.He also forgot to mention how his daughter was directly responsible for\u00a0operating a secret ISIS hospital on the Turkish side of the border where terrorists would go to heal their wounds, rest up, and return back to resume their slaughter of the Syrian people.Erdogan was also directly responsible for providing shelter and a free zone of operation on his territory for the 'Free Syrian Army' back in 2011. And it was Istanbul where he hosted the 'opposition' in order to plan its war against the Syrian people and its legitimate government. Erdogan also offered his territory to serve as the conduit through which a large portion of Gaddafi's arsenal (after he was lynched) was funneled into Syria eventually ending up in the hands of the al-Qaeda-linked terrorists in Syria - the so-called 'rat line' (which incidentally led to the murder of US ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi).All of this is to say nothing of the mass exodus of 'refugees' which he is directly responsible for (God only knows how many of whom are sadistic terrorists fleeing a lost cause) who are currently assaulting and raping their way around Europe, and of whom a cell has already perpetrated a mass killing in France.But President Erdogan - a man absolutely and indisputably guilty of mass murder, rape, pillage, plunder, torture, and enslavement on an epic scale - stands as shameless as ever. Worse still, he somehow manages to muster enough temerity to get in front of the cameras and tell the world that not only are his crimes not his fault; but rather, they are the fault of the very man who intervened to stop them.What can one say about such madness? What can one say about, or even to, a man who lies in such a nakedly-offensive and sickening manner?

Answer: Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama spearheaded this push.Hillary Clinton in particular displayed sociopathic and murderous intent as she spoke about threatening Assads family with death.Check out some of these amazing excerpts from her official emails:The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad. Negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear program will not solve Israel's security dilemma. Nor will they stop Iran from improving the crucial part of any nuclear weapons program \u2014 the capability to enrich uranium. At best, the talks between the world's major powers and Iran that began in Istanbul this April and will continue in Baghdad in May will enable Israel to postpone by a few months a decision whether to launch an attack on Iran that could provoke a major Mideast war.What does politics in\u00a0Syria have to do with nuclear weapons?Iran's nuclear program and Syria's civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. For Israeli leaders, the real threat from a nuclear-armed Iran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader launching an unprovoked Iranian nuclear attack on Israel that would lead to the annihilation of both countries.\u00a0What Israeli military leaders really worry about -- but cannot talk about -- is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.When have similar American actions interfered with political sovereignty in the Near-East and similar countries? What makes Syria different?The Obama administration has been understandably wary of engaging in an air operation in Syria like the one conducted in Libya for three main reasons. Unlike the Libyan opposition forces, the Syrian rebels are not unified and do not hold territory. The Arab League has not called for outside military intervention as it did in Libya. And the Russians are opposed. Libya was an easier case. But other than the laudable purpose of saving Libyan civilians from likely attacks by Qaddafi's regime, the Libyan operation had no long-lasting consequences for the region. Syria is harder. But success in Syria would be a transformative event for the Middle East. Not only would another ruthless dictator succumb to mass opposition on the streets, but the region would be changed for the better as Iran would no longer have a foothold in the Middle East from which to threaten Israel and undermine stability in the region.\u00a0Unlike in Libya, a successful intervention in Syria would require substantial diplomatic and military leadership from the United States. Washington should start by expressing its willingness to work with regional allies like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar to organize, train and arm Syrian rebel forces. The announcement of such a decision would, by itself, likely cause substantial defections from the Syrian military. Then, using territory in Turkey and possibly Jordan, U.S. diplomats and Pentagon officials can start strengthening the opposition. It will take time. But the rebellion is going to go on for a long time, with or without U.S. involvement. The second step is to develop international support for a coalition air operation.What were the American leaders view of Russia and the possibility of conflict with Russia?Russia will never support such a mission, so there is no point operating through the UN Security Council. Some argue that U.S. involvement risks a wider war with Russia. But the Kosovo example shows otherwise. In that case, Russia had genuine ethnic and political ties to the Serbs, which don't exist between Russia and Syria, and even then Russia did little more than complain. Russian officials have already acknowledged they won't stand in the way if intervention comes.Where are\u00a0Syria's connections\u00a0geopolitically\u00a0with Iran, and\u00a0why are these connections this viewed as a problem?\u00a0Back to Syria. It is the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's security \u2014 not through a direct attack, which in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel has never occurred, but through its proxies in Lebanon, like Hezbollah, that are sustained, armed and trained by Iran via Syria.Why would the fall of the Assad regime benefit Israel? Why is Syria so significant?The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel's leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Speaking on CNN's Amanpour show last week, Defense Minister Ehud Barak argued that \"the toppling down of Assad will be a major blow to the radical axis, major blow to Iran.... It's the only kind of outpost of the Iranian influence in the Arab world...and it will weaken dramatically both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.\" Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel's security, it would also ease Israel's understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.These emails effectively prove that the American government intentionally supported the \"moderate rebels\" (such as ISIS) in the disastrous Syrian civil war because they viewed it as the best way to protect Israeli interests. Hundreds of thousands were killed by the conflict, and millions were displaced, all of this fueled by American imperialists serving Israeli interests.Wikileaks sourceThis post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Of course they don't really know that, they're making it up.\"This is a big deal and a strong signal aimed at Trump as he mulls an attack on Syria. If he does it, he will face devastating criticism from his base.Interesting that Carlson doesn't mention the most obvious reason not to attack Syria, - the fact that Russia has said that it will definitely respond, i.e., attack US forces in response, starting a hot war between them that could very likely turn into WW3 very quickly.Full Transcript:Tonight leaders on both sides of the aisle in\u00a0Congress, in the media, in our intelligence services, and in virtually every over-funded think tank in Washington, have suddenly aligned tonight on a single point of agreement: America must go to war in Syria, immediately! Bashar al Assad cannot continue to lead that country, he must be overthrown!Assad is an evil man they tell us. His latest crime is a chlorine gas attack carried out over the weekend by his forces against a rebel-held suburb of Damascus. Assad's poison gas suffocated children. Pictures of the aftermath of that are all over the internet and they are horrifying. Assad is a monster - that's the official story. Almost everyone in power claims to believe it.The push to war in Syria, by the way, has united politicians from both sides. Lindsey Graham and Howard Dean typically agree on very little, but today they are both calling for war in Syria. Graham is demanding massive attacks on the Syrian military. Dean is going even further than that.\u00a0On Twitter he called the president \"a wimp\"\u00a0for merely sending thousands of troops and launching tons of bombs at Syria. That's not enough for Howard Dean, who was you may remember once ran for president as the peace candidate. Tonight he wants total war in Syria.Television pundits of course strongly agree. This morning the foreign policy team over at MSNBC explained that it's far more important for American troops to fight in Syria than it is to secure our own border here in America.\u00a0Watch:\u00a0(Clip of Andrea Mitchell, Mika Brzezinski, and\u00a0Joe Scarborough\u00a0calling for war). Trump has to take action in Syria everyone nods sagely.That ought to make you nervous.Universal bipartisan agreement on anything is usually the first sign that something deeply unwise is about to happen if only because there is nobody left to ask skeptical questions. And we should be skeptical of this, starting with the poison gas attack itself.All the geniuses tell us that Assad killed those children, but do they really know that? Of course they don't really know that, they're making it up. They have no real idea what happened.Actually both sides in the Syrian civil war possess chemical weapons. How would it benefit Assad using chlorine gas last weekend? Well it wouldn't. Assad's forces had been winning the war in Syria. The administration just announced its plans to pull American troops out of Syria having vanquished ISIS.\u00a0That's good news for Assad. About the only thing he could do to reverse it and to hurt himself would be to use poison gas against children. Well he did it anyway they tell us. He's that evil!Please keep in mind this is the same story they told us last April. Do you remember that it was almost exactly a year ago that the new administration announced it was no longer seeking to depose Assad from power?\u00a0Regime change was no longer our policy.The usual War chorus in Washington started yelping and went berserk and days later Assad supposedly used sarin gas against civilians in Syria! There was video!\u00a0 We bombed a Syrian air base in response.At the time, this show asked what seemed like the obvious question: are we really sure that Assad did that? It seems weirdly timed and counterproductive to him.\u00a0 - Shut up, they explained, of course we're sure! What an unpatriotic question! But of course they were lying.Two months ago the Secretary of Defense admitted that actually we still have no proof that Assad used sarin gas last year. The story, it turns out, was propaganda, designed to manipulate Americans, just like so much of what they say. We've seen this movie before and we know how it ends.Just for the sake of argument let's assume they're not lying this time. Let's assume Assad did\u00a0just use chlorine gas against kids. He's\u00a0perfectly capable of that, by the way, I'm\u00a0not defending his moral character. Let's say he did do it. Would that be worth starting a new war?Overthrowing Assad's regime in Syria would result in chaos. Many thousands would die. In fact we might likely see the genocide of one of the last remaining Christian communities in the Middle East and we ought to care about that. Some of the dead of course would be American servicemen. A\u00a0new war would cost us tens of billions of dollars, maybe hundreds of billions.\u00a0Would it make America safer? Would it make the region more stable? Let's see, how exactly did regime change work in Iraq and Libya?That doesn't matter!, say our moral leaders on CNN and everywhere else. Atrocities like this cannot be tolerated!OK, but let's be real - we do tolerate atrocities like this all the time, for example, there's a devastating famine killing children in Yemen right now. The\u00a0Saudis are causing that famine. Should we drop tomahawks on Riyadh in response?Not until it's on YouTube apparently.When you conduct foreign policy by viral video, pictures are essential, but in real life, Syria is a highly complicated place.\u00a0With Assad gone who would run it exactly? Do we have another strongman in place to install or is it our hope that a stable democracy will magically appear in the wake of this protracted civil war?And who exactly are these moderate rebels you're always hearing about?, the ones that we're supporting with your tax dollars? Well a lot of them turn out to be Islamist crazies. For example the city where the chemical attack just occurred is mostly controlled by the Army of Islam,\u00a0a radical group that has called for establishing an Islamic state under Sharia law in Syria. That group's founder called for exterminating all Shia Muslims and Alawites from the country but we're supposed to wage a new war on this groups behalf! Why is it that exactly?Back in 2013 when the Syrian civil war was still in its early days one onlooker weighed-in on Twitter.\u00a0Here's part of what he wrote:\"we should stay the hell out of Syria,\u00a0 the rebels are just as bad as the current regime, what will we get for our lives and billions of dollars?: Zero!\"In another tweet he said this:\"Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?\"And in yet another tweet he said this:\"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long-term conflict?!\"Of course you know who wrote that. It was Donald Trump, and he was right, and that's one of the reasons he got elected president.Now the same people who brought you a dying American middle class, un-defended American borders and endless pointless wars in countries you could not find out a map, are telling the president he's got to depose Assad for reasons that are both unclear and demonstrably dishonest.\u00a0 And by the way -\u00a0it may happen.Before it does Congress ought to consider a brand-new constitutional amendment.\u00a0 Let's call it the Lindsey Graham Amendment. Here's what it would say:\"Congress shall topple no government until it finishes re-building the last government it toppled and furthermore talk show\u00a0generals shall be required to personally visit the battlefield of every war they advocate for.\"That would have an immediate and positive effect!Let's hope it passes.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Syrians seeking refuge in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are also looking for ways to travel to the West. They lose their lives, their families, all their material assets on the road to West. During the Syrian civil war, Armenia,\u00a0one of the poorest countries in the world\u00a0with 3 million inhabitants, opened its\u00a0doors to Syrian refugees without any hesitation.Compared to its own population, Armenia has the third largest number\u00a0of Syrian refugees. In Armenia, where 17 thousand Syrian refugees live, there are 6 refugees in 1000 persons. The Syrians, who remind the Armenian people of their tragic history, are welcomed with sincerity in Armenia.With limited financial resources, the Armenian government has provided extensive assistance to refugees. In addition to free medical services, children of Syrian refugees can continue their educational life in Armenian schools. Within the \"Adopt a Family\" project, every Syrian family is trying to adapt to the social and cultural life of Armenia with the help of an Armenian family. Micro-scale initial loans are provided to help refugees adjust to Armenia by starting a new life.With a GDP of 1% of the EU countries and a unemployment rate of 17%, Armenia has received no support from foreign countries and international organizations for the efforts it has made to assist refugees.

And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are decapacitated and it is only strengthening ISIL.\u201dTranslated into plain English, Obama is complaining the Russian air campaign is destroying the people the US wants to take over Syria.This comment tells us something else.\u00a0 This is that the US expects the Russian air campaign to succeed, and the opposition to Assad to be defeated.This very revealing article in the Daily Beast describes the hand-wringing in Washington as its bluff in Syria is being called.Behind the bluster, there is no intention to interfere in the Russian air campaign, and rather than face off against the Russian air force, plans for US bombing raids on Syria and for no-fly zones have been called off.Moreover there is a bipartisan support for this, with war hawks like Hillary Clinton and Senator McCain isolated.This is consistent with scattered reports that despite its public show of defiance the US has actually heeded the Russian warning to stay out of Syrian air space whilst the Russian air campaign is underway.That warning was made in an intentionally humiliating way, giving the US just an hour to comply, to rub in the point that the days when the US and its allies could roam freely in the skies of Syria are well and truly over. \u00a0Future overflights and bombing raids will henceforth have to be coordinated with the Russians, at least whilst the Russian air campaign is underway.Obama of course also complains in his comments that the Russian air campaign, by defeating the so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition to President Assad, is helping the Islamic State.This has become the main theme of Western media commentary over the last few days.The argument is - to quote Obama again - that\u201cRussian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are decapacitated and it is only strengthening ISIL\u201d.The people Obama is referring to - the \"folks\" who may be \"driven underground\" or \"decapacitated\" - are the people the US is supporting in the fight against President Assad.It is now universally admitted these people are overwhelmingly Sunni militants - in other words armed jihadis - violently opposed to what they see as an apostate secular Alawite led government in Syria.\u00a0The idea that there can be a \u201cmoderate jihadi\u201d opposition to President Assad - any more than there was a \u201cmoderate jihadi\u201d opposition in Libya to\u00a0 Muammar Gaddafi - is one that would strike most people as bizarre.\u00a0 It is in fact an acknowledged fact that many of the \u201cmoderate jihadis\u201d fighting President Assad - who the US is supporting - are affiliated to Al-Qaeda.To say this however is to underestimate the obsessive character of the US's Syrian policy.US policy is to overthrow President Assad.\u00a0 The fact most of those fighing President Assad are militant jihadis is neither here nor there.\u00a0 If \u201cmoderate\u201d \u201cliberal\u201d \u201csecular\u201d Syrians cannot overthrow President Assad - and the lesson of the last four years is they cannot - then militant jihadis will have to do.The result is the absurd situation where the US is now running two covert programmes in Syria at the same time - one to create a jihadi army to fight President Assad; the other to create an army to fight the Islamic State, which also opposes President Assad, but which the US also says it opposes.The first programme - run by the CIA - has been a relative success.The second programme - run by the Pentagon - has despite the commitment of $500 million been a total failure.The reason the US has to have two programmes to create two different armies is because its first army - the jihadi army set up by the CIA to fight President Assad - won't fight the Islamic State. \u00a0As militant jihadis they have far too much in common with the Islamic State to be\u00a0 prepared to fight it.This is why the Islamic State has managed to win so much territory at their expense in so short a time. \u00a0Since the US backed jihadis are only motivated to fight President Assad, and will not fight the Islamic State in any meaningful way, when the two come into conflict the US backed jihadis tend to defect to the Islamic State .The distinction the US therefore makes between a \u201cmoderate\u201d armed opposition to President Assad and the Islamic State, has no meaningful ideological - and therefore political - reality.The only difference between the two groups is that the first - a militant jihadi group supported by the US - is focused on overthrowing President Assad, whilst the second - a militant jihadi group opposed by the US - is focused on expanding its territory.The victory of either group following the defeat of the Syrian government would however have the same result: the establishment of a violent sectarian jihadi state in Syria. \u00a0In practice, since the Islamic State is by far the better organised of the two groups attracting regular defections from the other group, its eventual victory would be all but certain.The key point - as Putin said in his UN speech - is that the only force in Syria that can be reliably trusted to fight the Islamic State is the Syrian army, together with its allies the Kurds and Hezbollah.To pretend otherwise is fantasy, denying the reality of the situation.What of repeated Western claims that the Syrian government is in some sort of implicit alliance with the Islamic State to weaken the anti-Assad opposition, and is not really fighting it?Putin has called this anti-Syrian propaganda and he is right.The problem is not that the Syrian army does not want to fight the Islamic State.\u00a0 The problem is that the jihadi army the US has created insists on fighting the Syrian army rather than the Islamic State.Since the Syrian army has its hands full fighting the jihadi army the US has created, it cannot fight the Islamic State, especially since the Islamic State, taking advantage of the situation, has - quite deliberately - focused on expanding its territory at the expense of other jihadi groups, instead of fighting the Syrian army.If the objective is to defeat the Islamic State, then the Russian policy is the only one that makes sense.\u00a0This is to help the Syrian army fight and defeat the Islamic State. \u00a0If that means destroying the US backed jihadis who are fighting the Syrian army, preventing the Syrian army from fighting the Islamic State, then the Russians have shown they will not balk from doing it. \u00a0They are right. \u00a0In the situation that exists in Syria now any other approach is not serious, and will end in failure.\u00a0The only alternative is to do what the Russians have been calling for since the first protests in Syria began in 2011: arrange negotiations without preconditions between President Assad and his opponents.President Assad agreed to this in 2011, and a road map for such negotiations was agreed at a conference in Geneva in 2012. \u00a0The negotiations never got underway because the Syrian opposition backed by the US refused to negotiate with President Assad, demanding he resign instead.This is a demand that the Syrian government concede to the Syrian opposition the victory the Syrian opposition has failed to win on the battlefield, whilst making a precondition for the negotiations a possible outcome of the negotiations.That is ridiculous, and both the Russians and the Syrian government have repeatedly made clear they will never agree to it.Whenever the Russians and the Syrian government say no to this demand, which they always do, the Syrian opposition and the US invariably escalate, with a disastrous decision taken in the autumn of 2011 to go to war.It was that decision to go to war that set the scene for the present disaster. \u00a0That a decision to go to war was made at that time was clear to anyone who was following the situation closely.\u00a0 Here is what I wrote in October 2011:\u201cNotwithstanding the defeat the western powers on this occasion (have) suffered on the Security Council it would be naive to think that they have abandoned their plans.In the days just before the vote the western press suddenly filled up with stories about how the protesters having supposedly despaired of peaceful protest were now turning to violent insurrection. \u00a0I take this as a clear sign that arms shipments to the protesters (or perhaps we should now call them rebels) are being stepped up.\u00a0 There are stories of a rebel army being formed in Turkey and of a rebel\u00a0Council obviously patterned on the Libyan Transitional Council being set up there. \u00a0Apparently the French government will be the first\u00a0to recognise this Council just as it was the first to recognise the Libyan Council in the spring. \u00a0One way or the other the war clouds\u00a0are gathering.\u201dThe logic of war is that the most violent and ruthless people generally come out on top, and that is what has happened in Syria with the rise of the Islamic State.That in turn has provoked the Russians to act by starting their air campaign.\u00a0 In doing so the Russians have the support of China, the Eurasian states, and the key regional powers, Iran and Iraq.\u00a0 By contrast, as Obama\u2019s plaintive comments and the article in the Daily Beast show, the US has been sidelined.If the US and West want to save some tatters of credibility out of this debacle, then now is probably their last chance to do what they should have done in 2011, which is get their Syrian proteges to sit down and talk with the Syrian government without preconditions.If they do that, then there is still a chance a settlement of the Syrian conflict can be agreed, allowing the focus to shift to where it should be, which is fighting the Islamic State.It has to be said however that with the US backed opposition now dominated by violent jihadists, the chances of successfully doing that now look remote. \u00a0Certainly they are far worse than they were back in 2011 or 2012.If the diplomatic route is to be followed - even at this very late stage - then the US and its allies will have to abandon their insane demand that President Assad go as a precondition for negotiations,\u00a0and their equally insane demand that the Russians force him to go .There are some people in the West, like the writer of the article in the Daily Telegraph\u00a0I attach below (since it is behind a paywall) who appear to understand this.It is far from clear however that US and Western leaders do.\u00a0 Despite some optimistic claims to the contrary, the most Western leaders for the moment seem prepared to concede is that President Assad might remain in power for a few months until power is handed over to those the US has groomed to take over. \u00a0This is something to which the Russians will never agree, as Putin made clear in his recent interview with Charlie Rose, when he said\u201cAt\u00a0no time in\u00a0the\u00a0past, now or\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0future has or\u00a0will Russia take any part in\u00a0actions aimed at\u00a0overthrowing (a)\u00a0legitimate government.\u201dThe idea the Russians will shift from this position - or can be bullied or bribed with threats or offers of Syrian bases to do so - is fantastic. \u00a0It is an idea that has been repeatedly tested over the last four years, and which has repeatedly been proved to be wrong. \u00a0It is incredible that - judging from the ceaseless Western media refrain that Russia \"push\" Assad into \"negotiations\" (ie. force him to go) - so many people in the West still don't grasp this.What the events of the last few weeks show is that the West now has a choice. \u00a0Either it revises its strategy, and engages meaningfully with the Russians - and President Assad - to find a way out of the Syrian crisis and to defeat the Islamic State, or the Russians will simply follow through the logic of their position and of their recent actions, and press on with their campaign together with their allies until the the Islamic State has been destroyed. \u00a0That is the objective Putin has declared, and there is no reason to think the Russians will not pursue it until it has been achieved. \u00a0The forces that are gathering, not just from Russia but also from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, from within Syria itself, and possibly even from China, are almost certainly enough to achieve it.The US and the West will in that case find themselves sidelined, becoming bystanders with none of their objectives in Syria achieved. \u00a0If that is the result, then the blame for the humiliation they will suffer will lie in their own intransigence and folly. \u00a0The \"exceptional country\", it will turn out, is not so exceptional after all.-----------------------------------The following article was first published in the Daily TelegraphFear of the peace: Why Assad is not the main obstacle to a deal on SyriaBig Question: Disagreement on Assad's fate in Syria is not the main obstacle to a peace deal \u2013 the real issue is addressing fears of what may followBy Tom HillRussia has upped the ante in the Syrian war, initiating its first military campaign in the Middle East since 1941.

Yet no international deal is in sight. Why?The current and long-standing consensus is that this is because of disagreements over Assad\u2019s fate. But this belief is a major error that is hindering a solution to the Syrian crisis \u2013 and a cause of the escalation just unleashed by Russia.Observers of civil wars almost always forget one crucial impediment to peacemaking. In even the most terrible of civil wars, for some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself \u2013 the wrong peace.Fear of the peaceThis is a lesson pertinent to Syria. The divisions over the \u201cAssad question\u201d are not the cause of the international and regional impasse on Syria; they are instead a manifestation of it \u2013 most of all relating to the peace that is expected to follow the war.For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself \u2013 the wrong peace.For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself \u2013 the For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself \u2013 the wrong peace peace. some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself \u2013 the wrong peace.For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself \u2013 the wrong peaceWhat are those fears? There are too many to list here, but begin by. For Iran the conflict is not about Assad, or even Syria. It is about Lebanon.What are those fears? There are too many to list here, but begin by considering Iran\u2019s interestsDue to the historical linkages between Syria and Lebanon, it is impossible for Iran to imagine that Hizbollah, its proxy in southern Lebanon, will survive if neighbouring Syria is ruled by a government actively hostile to Iranian interests. This is an existential issue for Iran because Hizbollah is Iran\u2019s deterrent against Israel. And without safeguards, Iran believes that removing Assad will surely mean the emergence of a sectarian, Sunni-dominated state \u2013 which will certainly be hostile to Iran.This is Iran\u2019s fear of the peace. Without agreements on safeguards that will prevent a sectarian political system and convince Iran there will not be a \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d in Syria, the Assad question will continue to dominate.But Assad is secondary, rather than the issue itself, and this indicates a way around the Assad conundrum.The Russian questionRussia has been more explicit, repeatedly demanding an answer from the West on the question: \u201cif Assad goes, who will replace him?\u201dFew Western analysts trust President Putin\u2019s statements, but he is being honest in his expressions of concern for what will follow.For Russia this relates to keeping Syria within their sphere of influence, retaining their Tartus naval base and airbase in Latakia, keeping their privileged relationship with Syria\u2019s military \u2013 including lucrative arms deals \u2013 and having a sure platform for fighting terrorists that might threaten Russia.Many Syrians too are afraid of what the end of the war will bring. Non-Sunnis and Kurds are deeply fearful of the prospect of a sectarian, Sunni Arab-dominated political system. They are unable to imagine how such a scenario will include full citizenship, equal rights and protections for minorities. They won\u2019t say it explicitly, as they too yearn for peace, but in their eyes the war is preferable to a peace on those terms.And without agreed safeguards on the character of the post-conflict political system \u2013 agreements that currently do not exist \u2013 they will remain convinced that this is what Assad\u2019s departure will mean.This fear is perhaps the primary driver of loyalty to the Syrian regime.What does this suggest for negotiations?Lord Soames, reflecting on the end of the civil war in Zimbabwe in 1980, wrote that the British mediators learnt \u201cto decide first whether the Sunday school treat was going to Bognor or Bournemouth \u2026 and discuss later whether it should go by train or coach.\u201d What Lord Soames meant was that before Britain could successfully mediate an agreement on a transitional government and a ceasefire, the parties had to agree first, in broad terms, to the end state that the peace process would deliver.There needs to be agreement on what they are buying before they are asked to pay the priceThe mediators had to neutralise the belligerents\u2019 fear of the peace before they could get them to agree on how to end the war.In Syria this means that the fear of the peace also needs to be neutralised, as a first step towards effective negotiations \u2013 both among Syrians and among the international stakeholders. There are viable constitutional and institutional mechanisms and international agreements that could be negotiated that would reassure Syrians that the post-conflict political system will not become a sectarian tyranny of the Sunni majority.And there are constitutional and international guarantees that could be negotiated to ensure a democratic Syria will not become, in the eyes of Iran, a threat to Hizbollah in Lebanon. And there are agreements that could be negotiated that reassure Russia that its place in Syria will remain.These will not end the challenge of the Assad question, but they could remove the fears that make it so difficult to handle.Four wasted yearsBut these kinds of agreements take time \u2013 time that may have just run out. Four years have been hopelessly wasted in negotiations that always began and ended with the Western demand that Assad must go or, at the most, go after a little while.It is absurd to think \u2013 as Assad\u2019s foes seemed to believe through their latest offers \u2013 that conceding that Assad might remain for a few weeks or months could somehow reassure Russia and Iran of their long-term interests in Syria.It is the long-term character of the Syrian state, its political system and what this means for its foreign relations that has been the primary obstacle to successful negotiations on Syria.It all comes down to a simple principle of commerce. If Assad is to go, then no one will have to do more to make this happen than Russia, Iran and Syrians themselves. There needs to be agreement on what they are buying before they are asked to pay the price. The Russians just got sick of waiting.Tom Hill\u00a0is the director of the Track II Mediation Unit at\u00a0King\u2019s College London\u00a0and a lecturer in international conflict resolution at Columbia University in New\u00a0This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Media statements by leaders makes them even worse. Recently, the newly appointed Commander, Curtis Scaparrotti, declared the alliance is ready to fight Russia. However, his predecessor, Philip Breedlove, was also verbally aggressive, and the Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg, shows no restraint when it comes to propaganda.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recent statements by NATO leaders sound not only hysterical but also rather helpless. We aren\u2019t claiming \u00a0that the alliance has nothing to oppose Russia with. NATO is the largest military and political organization of modern times, and it would be useless and even harmful to deny it.But the fact is that NATO is now at the margins of global policy.\u00a0Over the last couple of years, there have been many situations when the alliance could have played a key part, either positive or destabilizing \u2013 but didn\u2019t. The civil war in the Ukraine, the aggravation of the situation in Iraq, Syria, the spread of ISIS in Libya, only a few hundred kilometers from Europe, renewed civil war in Afghanistan.\u00a0Finally, there was a win-win situation for NATO: instability in the Mediterranean Area, cross-border criminality, illegal migration and refugees. It could have countered those low-level threats it talked so much about in 1990\u2019s. However, it failed again, and as a result, the omnipresent Frau Merkel planted in European heads the idea of a European army that, were it to be implemented, would make NATO meaningless.\u00a0Why did this happen?\u00a0On the one hand, US influence in NATO is shamelessly huge even with respect to Europe. On the other hand, alliance activity is so bureaucratized and politicized that it can only solve small problems, and only if the US is directly involved. Apart from that, NATO is becoming a political and information entity trying hard to keep its place in the system of European security.\u00a0That\u2019s why Baltic and Ukrainian politicians are warmly welcomed in NATO: they talk incessantly about the alliance, since it is a major proof of their existence. It seems that without these recurrent hysterics, NATO would actually drop off the global agenda. They keep it going, at least in terms of propaganda.\u00a0There is nothing good about that. NATO is the largest political/bureaucratic/media system that has ever existed. And it is a large community of people whose high salaries ensure that they personally value it. It\u2019s na\u00efve to think that they would agree to abandon the European military and political process without making a last stand.\u00a0Although the alliance is now only marginal, its members have become accustomed to \u2018downshifting\u2019 from the \u2018Major League\u2019 of world policy, and their style and political orientation are changing accordingly.\u00a0So when we talk about \u2018a dialogue with NATO\u2019, we should keep in mind that the only way to have a meaningful dialogue with the current alliance is to be aware that it is no longer headed by the biggest names in Atlantic policy to whom secret and obvious political threads led.\u00a0Russia should reject the idea it has had since the 1990\u2019s, that it was better to have security in Europe with NATO than without it. Maybe that was actually the case for a while. But we\u2019ve been living in a new world for a long time, a world of \u2018quantum instability\u2019 and hybrid wars, in which the alliance failed to prove itself and is unlikely to do so.\u00a0The reality is that the situation in Europe will be defined by two contradictory factors: on the one hand, returning to security issues as the main basis for relations between the majority of European states and Russia. Sad, but true. On the other hand, the fragmentation of the current security space and the creation of a new space in a \u2018Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals\u2019.\u00a0This idea is still likely to be studied, but the most interesting thing is that a relatively high security level and political stability appears in the areas controlled by Russia, including by force. For example, in the Crimea, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\u00a0Russia did its best to maintain the \u2018indivisibility of security\u2019 in Europe. It\u2019s not Russia\u2019s fault that this security (partly thanks to NATO ) turned out to be divisible, not only politically but geographically. Russia cannot and should not take on the burden of restoring this \u2018indivisibility\u2019, promoting NATO\u2019s returning to the \u2018Major League\u2019. This is what the alliance wants, at the cost of engaging a direct military confrontation with Russia, even if it means transforming some of its territories into \u2018near-frontline zones\u2019 (which is profitable for the bankrupted elites of a number of states).\u00a0We should be ready to accept a new regime of security in Europe and take an active part in creating new institutions, which will not be long in coming. We should get ready to \u00a0recognize that NATO can suddenly cease to be the only partner for discussing these issues.\u00a0This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

It had no record\u00a0of human rights violations or mass beheadings every year\u00a0like our good ally Saudi Arabia.2) Assad is the recognized legitimate leader of Syria by the whole world.3) There was no unrest in Syria untill a country 8,000 miles away decided they didn't like Assad - who\u00a0the hell knows why. Just a guess: Assad wasn't going to let said country steal Syrian resources for pennies on the dollar. Said country was not Russia but the USA. No little non-nuclear\u00a0armed country can refuse these type of American \"requests\" - there will be consequences. The\u00a0consequence for Syria was the funding of a rebel insurgency.4) That actions like this violate international law means nothing to the USA, especially when their\u00a0\"request\" (demand) for access to cheap resources is turned down.5) \u00a0If the funded mercenary revolution is not succeeding, that's when the aircraft carrier shows up\u00a0to assist the mercenary forces. US aircraft start flying in Syrian airspace without permission,\u00a0(violation of International Law) and then with no declaration of war, nor attack on US assets\u00a0by Syria. We start bombing the Syrian military and infrastructure, like bridges, highways, oil facilities -\u00a0you know, trying to wreck their economy. This is a gross violation of international law. As for\u00a0bombing cities, let's put it this way. If something of real importance is in downtown Damascus\u00a0it will be hit. We don't follow international law unless it's favorable to us. The only rule we like\u00a0is \"might makes right\" or \"because we can, and they can't strike back.\" The fact is, all the Syrians\u00a0killed by our bombing, or even by the mercenary forces we fund, the US is totally\u00a0responsible for because every move we make on the sea, in the air or on the ground in Syria\u00a0is illegal, because everyone of them breaks international law!6) Russia is operating legally in Syria under international law, because the legitimate recognized Syrian Government asked for help to get rid of the scum the US had illegally funded and armed on\u00a0Syrian territory. The Syrian Government is fighting a Civil War started by US funded and armed\u00a0insurgents, who have taken the city of Aleppo which they have held a long time. Anyone with a\u00a0brain bigger then a pea, knows street to street, house to house fighting is the bloodiest, most difficult\u00a0of all combat. And when the insurgents are dug in and well armed within fortifications you need to bomb the buildings to make it possible to win. And yes civilians are going to die, that's what happens\u00a0in inner-city warfare. It comes with the situation. But even these deaths are the responsibility of the USA and\u00a0NeoCons like Bush, Obama and Hillary Clinton.Check how bloody and deadly the USA's own civil war was. That was the last real war the US has fought\u00a0were there were real battles fought on US soil.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

We know it's a radical conceptThe meltdown continues.\u00a0We knew that the Israeli media would go bananas over Syria's decision to defend itself against Israeli airstrikes. But who could have foreseen this level of bananas?\u00a0Complements of a Times of Israel \"partner\", we learn: \"Israelis Now Forced To Consider The Putin Factor: Is Russia no longer Israel\u2019s security blanket in the Syrian civil war?\"Strange. We remember when Putin announced Russia's air operations in Syria. But we\u00a0don't remember him mentioning anything about Russian forces intervening in order to be \"Israel's security blanket\".Let's allow the author to clarify. Perhaps we're misreading this brain-dead question:What was said about Israeli activities over the Syrian border a week ago only during private meetings is now discussed openly by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cWhen we detect attempts to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah and we have the intelligence and feasibility to carry out an operation, we will work to prevent it,\u201d he said.But if Israelis are internalizing this reality, they\u2019re still mostly failing to grasp the new and unsettling questions about the Russian regime. Russia is Israel\u2019s security blanket in the Syrian civil war, with its presence there helping to keep the Syrian regime from acting against Israel, isn\u2019t it? Perhaps not, seeing that Russia didn\u2019t prevent the firing of anti-aircraft missiles towards Israeli targets.We see. So Russia isn't in Syria to fight the \"moderate\" rebels and Islamic State (which Israel prefers to Iran); no, Putin's\u00a0primary objective in Syria is to \"help keep the Syrian regime from acting against Israel\". And if Russia isn't \"protecting\" Israel from Syria, this clearly raises \"new and unsettling questions about the Russian regime\".Here's an idea: What about just \"not bombing Syria\"? Isn't that a good first step towards security and friendly relations with your neighbor?\u00a0Please just stop. But alas, it doesn't stop:The situation is baffling, even to Syria experts like Hebrew University\u2019s Moshe Maoz. \u201cThere are so many enigmas, and it\u2019s very difficult to know what is going on,\u201d Maoz told me this week. Was the Syrian regime prepared to act against Israel in defiance of Russia, which would be worrying, or did Russia give it the go-ahead to fire, which would be deeply concerning?It's certainly baffling that Israel thinks\u00a0it can bomb a sovereign nation with impunity \u2014 and then goes crying to Putin when it can't.\u00a0We do not believe that Russia is interested in any kind of confrontation with Israel. But this idea that Russia was Israel's mall cop in Syria is a bit extreme. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u00a0has made it clear\u00a0that Russia thinks Hezbollah has played an important role in defeating ISIS in Syria.\u00a0A bit of a diplomatic pickle for the Israelis, no?It's clear that Russia and Israel have some sort of understanding in Syria.\u00a0What's also clear is that last week's airstrikes\u00a0near Palmyra (the Israelis insist they were targeting weapon shipments for Hezbollah) violated this understanding.\u00a0We reported\u00a0earlier this week\u00a0that Syria's U.N. envoy\u00a0Bashar Jaafari said that\u00a0Syria's\u00a0use of anti-aircraft missiles against Israeli fighter jets was a \"message\" from Putin.Israel's ambassador was summoned by Moscow after Friday's airstrikes, and reports\u00a0have emerged\u00a0that Russian military advisors were operating just a few kilometers from the area that was targeted by Israeli strikes; so there's certainly circumstantial evidence to back up Jaafari's claim.\u00a0But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0insists the exact opposite\u00a0\u2014 that Putin understands that \"if there is a feasibility from an intelligence and military standpoint - [Israel will]\u00a0attack [targets in Syria]\".If Israel seeks\u00a0\"security\", maybe it should compromise and cooperate with its neighbors, instead of rooting for ISIS to win in Syria? It's a radical proposition \u2014 but it just might work.P.S. \u2014 a final blockquote from this media metldown, because we can't resist:Two weeks ago Netanyahu stood at the Kremlin, talking to Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin about Purim and the concern of Israelis of modern Haman-like plans to destroy the Jews.Yeah, that wasn't very compelling. Next time Netanyahu should try citing current events, instead of Bible stories from 2,000 years ago:\u00a0This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Syrian regime warplane highlights the rapidly shifting dynamic in the six-year conflict where President Donald Trump has given American commanders a freer rein in the battlefield.The United States insisted Monday it wants no broader role in Syria's civil war, and seeks only to destroy the Islamic State group, but the weekend incident shows the limits of America's ability to stay disengaged.With myriad competing forces quickly converging in Syria, and new powers delegated to Trump's commanders, the risk of additional confrontation is real.- What happened? -An American F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian SU-22 on Sunday evening as it \"dropped bombs\" near a US-backed alliance called the Syrian Democratic Forces, who are fighting IS, the US-led coalition said in a statement.The Syrian warplane was shot down \"in accordance with rules of engagement and in collective self-defense of coalition partnered forces,\" the statement said.Syria's army has disputed this account, saying its plane was hit while conducting a mission against IS.A US official told AFP the pilot of the Syrian plane appeared to have ejected before the jet was hit, though his fate was unknown.- How serious is this? -The shoot-down marks the first time a US jet has downed a Syrian regime warplane, despite leading a massive air campaign targeting IS in Syria for nearly three years.Russia, which is flying its own air war in Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, condemned the incident and said it had shut off a special \"deconfliction\" hotline with the US military, though top officer General Joe Dunford later said the United States was seeking to re-establish the channel.Sunday's incident marks the latest in a series of US attacks on pro-regime forces.On April 7, Trump authorized a cruise missile strike against a Syrian air base in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by the regime against civilians.Then on May 18, coalition aircraft struck a pro-regime convoy apparently transporting Shia militiamen as it drove toward a coalition garrison at At-Tanaf near the Jordanian border.A similar incident occurred June 6, and on June 8 a US warplane shot down a pro-regime drone in Syria after it fired at coalition forces.- Deepening American involvement? -The Pentagon has repeatedly stressed it has no interest in increasing its role in Syria's civil war, and that its sole focus is on defeating IS.What the recent incidents \"indicate is a complicated and complex battlespace, and we continue to try to operate transparently and to communicate intentions around our actions so it is clear we are focusing on the defeat of ISIS in Syria,\" US Central Command spokesman Colonel John Thomas said on Monday.Officials emphasize the strikes were all conducted in self-defense after pro-regime forces ignored warnings.But the incidents also highlight the changing dynamics of the Syrian civil war, and observers say further confrontations are likely.\"The US mission in Syria is dangerously morphing from a counterterrorism action against the Islamic State into a party to Syria's civil war,\" said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and editor of its Long War Journal.Until recently, pro-regime forces were focused on fighting rebels in western Syria but victories in Aleppo and elsewhere have freed them up to move east, pushing them into contact with the SDF.Many analysts see Iran's hand behind this push, and highlight Tehran's concerns over the growing strength and influence of the SDF.Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, sees the unfolding situation in Syria as an inevitable consequence of America's stubborn insistence that it is only in the country to fight IS, without addressing the broader civil war.\"We cannot only fight ISIS effectively -- we are going to come into conflict with others. We have to more clearly define what our position is,\" he said.- New powers -Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to quickly defeat IS, ordered his generals to come up with a revised plan to defeat the jihadist group.The review resulted in an \"annihilation campaign\" aimed at killing all IS fighters, and saw commanders gain greater autonomy to make battlefield decisions and approve strikes.Thomas said the new powers would not have played any role in the recent decisions to attack pro-regime forces, as these were all ordered in self-defense.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this

["author-section", "byline-plain", "byline-section", "rc-title", "bdrgr2", "m-b-15"], "content": "By\n\nAfp\n\nPublished:\n  11:29 BST, 27 June 2017\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  12:20 BST, 27 June 2017\n\nThe United States will not be drawn into Syria's civil war, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has said, despite an increasingly complicated battle space that has seen US warplanes down pro-regime aircraft.Speaking to reporters on a military plane late Monday as he headed for meetings in Europe, Mattis said the US-led coalition was determined to keep a strict focus on fighting the Islamic State group.We won't fire \"unless they are the enemy, unless they are ISIS,\" he said, using an acronym for the jihadist organisation.\"We just refuse to get drawn into a fight there in the Syria civil war, we try to end that one through diplomatic engagement.\"His comments came shortly before White House spokesman Sean Spicer issued a statement saying President Bashar al-Assad's regime may be preparing for a chemical attack against civilians, and warning that the Syrian military would pay a \"heavy price\" if it took such action.Coalition forces on the ground have accused pro-regime fighters of targeting them in recent weeks, as they shot down two Iran-made attack drones and a Syrian fighter jet.\"If somebody comes after us, bombs us or takes a heading on us or fires on us, then under legitimate self-defence we'll do whatever we have to do to stop it,\" Mattis said.The coalition has been active in Syria since late 2014, bombing IS targets and training local fighters to conduct ground assaults against the group.But gains for Assad, who is being supported by Russia, have allowed regime forces and Iran-backed militias to head towards areas where the coalition is operating.The Pentagon chief underscored the importance of maintaining communication with Russia as it conducts its campaign for Assad.So-called \"deconfliction\" hotlines are used regularly by the two sides to notify each other where they are operating and avoid accidents.Such hotlines will only grow in importance as the coalition pursues IS fighters into the Euphrates River Valley following their assumed defeat in their stronghold Raqa, as pro-regime forces also move toward the same region.\"You've got to really play this thing very carefully,\" Mattis said.\"The closer we get, the more complex it gets.\"- Weapons to the Kurds -Mattis addressed another aspect of Syria's tangled conflict -- the US supply of weapons to Kurdish fighters battling to recapture the Islamic State stronghold of Raqa in the north.The move has angered NATO ally Turkey, which says the Kurdish militia force YPG is linked to separatists of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) who have waged an insurgency since 1984, killing more than 40,000 people inside Turkey.Mattis said the US military would recover some logistical gear after the anti-IS fight, though he did not give details.Asked whether the US would also try to recover weapons, Mattis said, \"We'll do what we can\".\"We'll be recovering them during the battle, repairing them, when they don't need certain things any more they'll replace those with some things they do need, that sort of thing,\" he said.When asked how well armed the YPG would be after Raqa, Mattis said: \"We'll see\".\"It depends what the next mission is,\" he said. \"It's not like the fight's over when Raqa is over.\"Mattis is visiting the Marshall Center in Bavaria to commemorate 70 years since the Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Europe after World War II, before heading to a NATO summit in Brussels.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media

According to media reports on 24 August 2015 Islamic State (IS) miltants have blown up Palmyra's ancient temple of Baalshamin. Palmyra is believed to be founded by King Solomon. It was long a trade center that boomed with the decline of Petra in modern-day Jordan. The city, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Damascus, emerged to become a powerful state after the Romans took control, serving as a link between the ancient Orient and Mediterranean countries.

Since early 2011, hundreds of thousands have died; around ten million Syrians have been displaced; Europe has been convulsed with Islamic State (ISIS) terror and the political fallout of refugees; and the United States and its NATO allies have more than once come perilously close to direct confrontation with Russia.Unfortunately, President Barack Obama has greatly compounded the dangers by hiding the US role in Syria from the American people and from world opinion. An end to the Syrian war requires an honest accounting by the US of its ongoing, often secretive role in the Syrian conflict since 2011, including who is funding, arming, training, and abetting the various sides. Such exposure would help bring to an end many countries\u2019 reckless actions.A widespread \u2013 and false \u2013 perception is that Obama has kept the US out of the Syrian war. Indeed, the US right wing routinely criticizes him for having drawn a line in the sand for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over chemical weapons, and then backing off when Assad allegedly crossed it (the issue remains murky and disputed, like so much else in Syria).\u00a0 A leading columnist for the Financial Times, repeating the erroneous idea that the US has remained on the sidelines, recently implied that Obama had rejected the advice of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to arm the Syrian rebels fighting Assad.Yet the curtain gets lifted from time to time. In January, the New York Times finally reported on a secret 2013 Presidential order to the CIA to arm Syrian rebels. As the account explained, Saudi Arabia provides substantial financing of the armaments, while the CIA, under Obama\u2019s orders, provides organizational support and training.Unfortunately, the story came and went without further elaboration by the US government or follow up by the New York Times. The public was left in the dark: How big are the ongoing CIA-Saudi operations? How much is the US spending on Syria per year? What kinds of arms are the US, Saudis, Turks, Qataris, and others supplying to the Syrian rebels? Which groups are receiving the arms? What is the role of US troops, air cover, and other personnel in the war? The US government isn\u2019t answering these questions, and mainstream media aren\u2019t pursuing them, either.On more than a dozen occasions, Obama has told the American people that there would be \u201cno US boots on the ground.\u201d Yet every few months, the public is also notified in a brief government statement that US special operations forces are being deployed to Syria. The Pentagon routinely denies that they are in the front lines. But when Russia and the Assad government recently carried out bombing runs and artillery fire against rebel strongholds in northern Syria, the US notified the Kremlin that the attacks were threatening American troops on the ground. The public has been given no explanation about their mission, its costs, or counterparties in Syria.Through occasional leaks, investigative reports, statements by other governments, and rare statements by US officials, we know that America is engaged in an active, ongoing, CIA-coordinated war both to overthrow Assad and to fight ISIS. America\u2019s allies in the anti-Assad effort include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and other countries in the region. The US has spent billions of dollars on arms, training, special operations forces, air strikes, and logistical support for the rebel forces, including international mercenaries. American allies have spent billions of dollars more. The precise sums are not reported.The US public has had no say in these decisions. There has been no authorizing vote or budget approval by the US Congress. The CIA\u2019s role has never been explained or justified. The domestic and international legality of US actions has never been defended to the American people or the world.To those at the center of the US military-industrial complex, this secrecy is as it should be. Their position is that a vote by Congress 15 years ago authorizing the use of armed force against those culpable for the 9/11 attack gives the president and military carte blanche to fight secret wars in the Middle East and Africa. Why should the US explain publicly what it is doing? That would only jeopardize the operations and strengthen the enemy. The public does not need to know.I subscribe to a different view: wars should be a last resort and should be constrained by democratic scrutiny. This view holds that America\u2019s secret war in Syria is illegal both under the US Constitution (which gives Congress the sole power to declare war) and under the United Nations Charter, and that America\u2019s two-sided war in Syria is a cynical and reckless gamble. The US-led efforts to topple Assad are not aimed at protecting the Syrian people, as Obama and Clinton have suggested from time to time, but are a US proxy war against Iran and Russia, in which Syria happens to be the battleground.The stakes of this war are much higher and much more dangerous than America\u2019s proxy warriors imagine. As the US has prosecuted its war against Assad, Russia has stepped up its military support to his government. In the US mainstream media, Russia\u2019s behavior is an affront: how dare the Kremlin block the US from overthrowing the Syrian government? The result is a widening diplomatic clash with Russia, one that could escalate and lead \u2013 perhaps inadvertently \u2013 to the point of military conflict.These are issues that should be subject to legal scrutiny and democratic control. I am confident that the American people would respond with a resounding \u201cno\u201d to the ongoing US-led war of regime change in Syria. The American people want security \u2013 including the defeat of ISIS \u2013 but they also recognize the long and disastrous history of US-led regime-change efforts, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.This is the main reason why the US security state refuses to tell the truth. The American people would call for peace rather than perpetual war. Obama has a few months left in office to repair his broken legacy. He should start by leveling with the American people. \u00a9 Project Syndicate 1995\u20132016\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Syrian civil war: One million children left the country", "classes": [], "content": "Half of all refugees are children and many under age of 11One million children abandoned Syria, due to the ongoing war.

Assad, who trained in London as an ophthalmologist, came to power through a twist of fate: his oldest brother Basil who had been groomed to succeed their father was killed in car crash in 1994, leaving Bashar as the next in line. He quickly showed promise as a young reformer after his father\u2019s autocratic government, but those hopes faded before being almost forgotten entirely in the carnage of the civil war.\u2014 AHMAD AL-JARBA: The leader of the main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition. Elected to the post in July, al-Jarba hails from Syria\u2019s northeastern province of Hassakeh and is a member of the powerful Shammar tribe that extends into neighboring Iraq. He was a little-known anti-Assad figure before Syria\u2019s civil war though he was detained in March 2011 \u2014 days after the uprising against Assad began. It was his second arrest, following one in 1996 when he was held for two years because of anti-government activities. After his release, al-Jarba left Syria in August 2011 and became active in the opposition. He is widely viewed as being close to Saudi Arabia, and his election as coalition chief was seen as a sign that Riyadh had taken over the mantle as the rebellion\u2019s main patron from Qatar.\u2014 GEN. SALIM IDRIS: The commander of the coalition\u2019s military wing, the Supreme Military Council, which brings together a collection of loosely-knit rebel brigades under the emblem of the Free Syrian Army. His group serves as the main conduit for Western military aid to moderate rebel groups, although Idris says that support has been meager and slow to arrive. The general, a former lecturer at Syria\u2019s main military college, took up his post in December. He says he travels to rebel-held areas in Syria frequently, and also stays in touch with his officers by Skype. He defected from the Syrian military after 35 years, and is seen as a secular-minded moderate.\u2014 JABHAT AL-NUSRA: An Islamist extremist group affiliated with al-Qaida. Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Nusra Front, has emerged as one of the most powerful rebel factions on the battlefield. The U.S. has designated the group a terrorist organization. Jabhat al-Nusra has claimed responsibility for many of the deadliest suicide bombings targeting regime and military facilities. The presence of Islamic extremists among the rebels is one reason the West has not equipped the Syrian opposition with sophisticated weapons, such as anti-aircraft missiles. In recent months, Jabhat al-Nusra has been eclipsed to a degree by the rising power of another al-Qaida-affiliated group \u2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\u2014 ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT: Al-Qaida\u2019s longtime affiliate in Iraq. The Islamic State has moved aggressively in recent months into Syria, and has established a major presence particularly in the north. It has not limited its efforts to fighting the government alone, but has opened fronts against more moderate rebel groups, as well as Syria\u2019s Kurdish minority. The group also is known to cooperate with other rebel factions for specific operations. Syrian activists say the Islamic State is largely composed of foreign fighters and has shown a degree of ruthlessness beyond that of Jabhat al-Nusra.\u2014 HEZBOLLAH: The Lebanese Shiite militant group. Hezbollah has sent its gunmen to fight alongside Assad\u2019s forces, providing a significant boost to the government\u2019s overstretched military. Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has suggested he would do everything it takes to save Assad\u2019s government, which has been a patron and ally of the militant group for decades. Hezbollah\u2019s deep involvement in the conflict underlines the regional sectarian aspect of the conflict, in which an Iranian-backed Shiite axis faces off against Sunnis supported by Gulf Arabs in a proxy war extending into neighboring Lebanon and Iraq. \nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Now, faced with an alarming risk of a renewed escalation of fighting, it\u2019s time for the United Nations Security Council to step in to end the bloodshed, based on a new framework agreed by the Council\u2019s permanent members.Here are the basics. In 2011, in the context of the Arab Spring, the US government, in conjunction with the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and Israel, decided to bring down Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, even though overthrowing another country\u2019s government amounts to a blatant violation of international law. We know that in 2012, if not earlier, President Barack Obama\u00a0authorized\u00a0the CIA to work with America\u2019s allies in providing support to rebel forces composed of disaffected Syrians as well as non-Syrian fighters. US policymakers evidently expected Assad to fall quickly, as had occurred with the governments of Tunisia and Egypt in the early months of the Arab Spring.The Assad regime is led by the minority Alawi Shia sect in a country where Alawites account for just 10% of the population, Sunni Muslims account for 75%, Christians make up 10%, and 5% are others, including Druze. The regional powers behind Assad\u2019s regime include Iran and Russia, which has a naval base on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coastline.Whereas America\u2019s goal in seeking to topple Assad was mainly to undercut Iranian and Russian influence, Turkey\u2019s motive was to expand its influence in former Ottoman lands and, more recently, to counter Kurdish ambitions for territorial autonomy, if not statehood, in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia wanted to undermine Iran\u2019s influence in Syria while expanding its own, while Israel, too, aimed to counter Iran, which threatens Israel through Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria near the Golan Heights, and Hamas in Gaza. Qatar, meanwhile, wanted to bring a Sunni Islamist regime to power.The armed groups supported by the US and allies since 2011 were assembled under the banner of the Free Syrian Army. In fact, there was no single army, but rather competing armed groups with distinct backers, ideologies, and goals. The fighters ranged from dissident Syrians and autonomy-seeking Kurds to Sunni jihadists backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.While vast resources were devoted to overthrowing Assad, the effort ultimately failed, but not before causing massive bloodshed and displacing millions of Syrians. Many fled to Europe, fomenting Europe\u2019s refugee crisis and a surge in political support for Europe\u2019s anti-immigrant extreme right.There were four main reasons for the failure to overthrow Assad. First, Assad\u2019s regime had backing among not only Alawites, but also Syrian Christians and other minorities who feared a repressive Sunni Islamist regime. Second, the US-led coalition was countered by Iran and Russia. Third, when a splinter group of jihadists split away to form the Islamic State (ISIS), the US diverted significant resources to defeating it, rather than to toppling Assad. Finally, the anti-Assad forces have been deeply and chronically divided; for example, Turkey is in open conflict with the Kurdish fighters backed by the US.All of these reasons for failure remain valid today. The war is at a stalemate. Only the bloodshed continues.America\u2019s official narrative has sought to conceal the scale and calamitous consequences of US efforts \u2013 in defiance of international law and the UN Charter \u2013 to overthrow Assad. While the US vehemently complains about Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, America and its allies have repeatedly violated Syrian sovereignty. The US government mischaracterizes the war as a civil war among Syrians, rather than a proxy war involving the US, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Qatar.In July 2017, US President Donald Trump announced the end of CIA support for the Syrian rebels. In practice, though, US engagement continues, though now it is apparently aimed more at weakening Assad than overthrowing him. As part of America\u2019s continued war-making, the Pentagon announced in December that US forces would remain indefinitely in Syria, ostensibly to support anti-Assad rebel forces in areas captured from ISIS, and of course without the assent of the Syrian government.The war is in fact at risk of a new round of escalation. When Assad\u2019s regime recently attacked anti-Assad rebels, the US coalition\u00a0launched airstrikes\u00a0that killed around 100 Syrian troops and an unknown number of Russian fighters. Following this show of force, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis disingenuously\u00a0stated\u00a0that, \u201cObviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war.\u201d In addition, Israel recently attacked Iranian positions in Syria.The US and its allies should face reality and accept the persistence of Assad\u2019s regime, despicable as it may be. The UN Security Council, backed by the US, Russia, and the other major powers, should step in with peacekeepers to restore Syrian sovereignty and urgent public services, while blocking attempts at vengeance by the Assad regime against former rebels or their civilian supporters.Yes, the Assad regime would remain in power, and Iran and Russia would maintain their influence in Syria. But the US official delusion that America can call the shots in Syria by choosing who rules, and with which allies, would end. It\u2019s long past time for a far more realistic approach, in which the Security Council pushes Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, and Israel into a pragmatic peace that ends the bloodshed and allows the Syrian people to resume their lives and livelihoods.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Bitterness, rancor stirred by Syria\u2019s civil war on full display at Geneva peace conference", "classes": [], "content": "    Bitterness of Syrian war on display at talks      by ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press - 29 January 2014 13:20-05:00      GENEVA  (AP) \u2014 The bitterness and rancor stirred by Syria's civil war were on full display this week at peace talks in Switzerland \u2014 and not just in the closed room where rival delegations are seeking a way to end the three-year conflict.\n    For the first time since the country devolved into its bloody civil war, supporters and opponents of President B...This story is part of New Europe's Premium content.\u00a0\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "A look at some of the journalists who have gone missing while covering the Syrian civil war", "classes": [], "content": "    A look at some journalists missing in Syria     Associated Press - 9 November 2013 10:17-05:00      BEIRUT  (AP) \u2014 At least 30 journalists currently are reported missing while covering Syria's civil war.

The suspected chemical attack took place over weekend in the Damascus suburb of Douma, killing at least 49 people. The draft resolution was vetoed by Vassily Nebenzia, Russia\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations. \bEPA-EFE/JUSTIN LANEThe die, it seems, is cast for a rapid end to the United States mission in Syria \u2013 and, with it, the chances of a peaceful and sustainable resolution to that country\u2019s brutal seven-year civil war. The chemical attack allegedly carried out last week by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces in Douma, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region, shows just how dangerous that prospect is for Syria and the world.US President Donald Trump\u2019s bluster in the wake of the chemical attack exposes the incoherence and contradictions of his approach, as well as his lack of any real strategy in Syria. Ordering an attack or two against Assad\u2019s forces, as he might do, would neither alter the balance of power there, nor improve Trump\u2019s position in the war-torn country, let alone the Middle East in general.To be sure, Trump\u2019s top military advisers have persuaded him to keep in place the 2,000 military personnel currently stationed in Syria. But he has already limited America\u2019s objectives there to eliminating the small remaining Islamic State (ISIS) presence \u2013 an effort that should take about six months.In constraining America\u2019s commitment, Trump has forfeited the opportunity to help shape Syria\u2019s future, reinforcing the widespread perception \u2013 which has taken hold among friends and foes alike \u2013 that US global leadership is in retreat. He has also disregarded the country\u2019s ongoing humanitarian crisis, the worst since World War II.Ironically, this narrow approach also undermines the effort to achieve Trump\u2019s sole objective, as a lasting defeat of ISIS and other jihadists will demand a credible political transition that permanently ends the civil war. Such a transition will be possible only through diplomatic engagement by actors with stakes in Syria.With Trump\u2019s withdrawal implying that the US and its allies have lost the war, Assad already feels emboldened to forge ahead \u2013 with Russian and Iranian support \u2013 with his plan to recapture the remaining rebel-held territories at all costs. After establishing \u201cfacts on the ground,\u201d Assad and his allies would be able to present the world with a fait accompli: Assad remains in power, without making any real concessions to the opposition.Local and regional actors that placed their faith in America\u2019s commitments will pay a bloody price. In particular, the Kurds \u2013 America\u2019s most reliable and effective ally in the fight against ISIS \u2013 are likely to be left out in the cold, despite official US assurances about security arrangements after the US withdrawal.Already, Kurds have criticized the Trump administration for sacrificing them at the altar of America\u2019s strategic relations with Turkey. The US turned a blind eye to Turkey\u2019s recent invasion and occupation of the Kurdish-held city of Afrin in northwest Syria, which led to the slaughter of more than 1,000 Kurds, including scores of civilians.With a US withdrawal, the Kurds may feel compelled to ally with Assad for protection. Hundreds of Kurdish fighters have already deserted the fight against ISIS in northeast Syria, journeying to Afrin to resist the joint assault by Turkey and a splinter group of Syrian rebels. Some young Kurds have begun to join Assad\u2019s paramilitary units to avenge the loss of Afrin.But it will be a difficult battle, as America\u2019s departure is likely to strengthen Turkey\u2019s hand further. After all, without the US, the other main foreign powers in the Syrian conflict \u2013 Turkey, Russia, and Iran \u2013 will be able to consolidate their spheres of influence and divide the spoils of the post-war reconstruction among themselves. While their specific interests may differ, all three countries share a vision of a \u201csoft\u201d partition of Syria that reduces Assad and the rebels to mere proxies.Russia and Iran will be the two biggest winners. Russian President Vladimir Putin is the kingmaker whose timely military intervention saved Assad\u2019s regime from defeat and turned the war\u2019s tide in his favor. Whereas the US is almost nowhere to be seen in Syria, Russia is everywhere, constantly rearranging the pieces on the conflict\u2019s chessboard.Russia\u2019s coordination with all major regional powers \u2013 including Turkey, a NATO member \u2013 attests to the dynamism (and cynicism) of the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy. As the US pulls up stakes in Syria, Turkey\u2019s military and economic ties to Russia will only deepen.Like Russia, Iran has invested plenty of blood and treasure to save Assad\u2019s regime \u2013 and reaped handsome returns. Iran is now the most influential regional power in Syria, as it is in Iraq and Lebanon. But the rush to fill the vacuum left by the US might provide the spark that ignites a region-wide war. There are legitimate concerns that Israel might use the withdrawal of US troops as a pretext to intensify its attacks on Iran and Hezbollah in Syria \u2013 a decision that could escalate into all-out regional conflict, one that draws in the US, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s main rival for regional hegemony.Even leaving aside Trump\u2019s hostility to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement \u2013 which adds yet another source of risk to an already perilous situation \u2013 there is now a real and present danger that Syria will become the site of a conflagration even more destructive than the one raging there since 2011.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018. www.project-syndicate.org\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Saudi Arabia considers deployment of troops in Syria", "classes": [], "content": "Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir attends a press conference during the 29th Arab Summit, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 15 April 2018. Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, says Riyadh is discussing the possibility of sending troops to Syria amid US draw down. Saudi Arabia is holding talks with the US about sending troops into northeast Syria as part of an international coalition that would replace US forces , said Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir.The statement was made in the wake of US President Donald J. Trump\u2019s surprise announcement that he plans to pull out American military personnel from Syria and hand over the responsibility to Arab nations from the Gulf and surrounding Levant.Speaking at a press conference alongside UN Head Antonio Guterres on April 17, al-Jubeir said Riyadh had considered deploying an expeditionary force into Syria early as 2011, when the ongoing conflict first began.\u201cWe made a proposal to the Obama administration that if the US were to send forces\u2026then Saudi Arabia would consider doing so, along with other countries, as part of a joint contingent,\u201d said al-Jubeir.The Saudi Defence Ministry had in 2016 already offered to send ground troops to Syria to participate in operations carried out by the US-led coalition against ISIS. The Saudis, however stopped short of committing to a full deployment of ground troops to fight ISIS after having already become bogged down in the ongoing Yemeni Civil War. At the time, Riyadh offered to take part in a limited capacity, saying they were ready to launch air strikes against the Islamic State.Al-Jubeir\u2019s latest statement likely indicates the determination of the Saudis to continue their campaign of countering the influence of Iran, Riyadh\u2019s traditional archenemy in the Middle East.Saudi Arabia\u2019s State Minister for Arab Gulf Affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, visited the then-recently liberated Syrian city of Raqqa in September 2017, the self-declared capital of ISIS, to offer Saudi financial assistance for the city\u2019s reconstruction.According to Samir Seifan, an economist and researcher from the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, the US\u2019 approach to Syria following ISIS\u2019 defeat is similar to the military strategy employed in Iraq before the Americans\u2019 formal withdrawal in 2011.\u201cOn the one hand, Trump wants to pull American troops out of Syria. But on the other hand, Washington wants to keep control of the developments in the region. The same thing happened to the American policy in Iraq\u2026we are well aware how it ended up,\u201d Seifan said.The Syrian War began after the country\u2019s Sunni population was swept up by the Arab Spring protests the spread from the Maghreb in North Africa to the Persian Gulf over the course of the last weeks of 2011 and early 2012.The initials stages of the fighting saw a bloody civil war break out between the majority Sunnis and forces loyal to the government of Bashar al-Assad, a member of the minority Alawite community, a sect of Shia Islam.The war later\u00a0expanded into a proxy war between Assad\u2019s main backers \u2013Russia, Iran, and Lebanon\u2019s radical Shiite party, Hezbollah \u2013 against a US-led coalition that supported the Syrian rebels. Since the involvement of the outside players in the conflict, as well as the rise of ISIS in early 2014, and the battlefield success of Syria\u2019s Kurds and Turkey\u2019s subsequent invasion of the north of country to crush their advances, the war has become a morass of multi-sided conflicts with few prospects of forging a lasting peace agreement that is acceptable to all sides.According to the UN, over 5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict and 6 million more are internally displaced, while an estimated 13 million people are in need of urgent assistance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Assad filmed driving himself to the front lines of Syrian civil war", "classes": ["c-hot-topic__subtitle", "c-hot-topic__subtitle"], "content": "Assad filmed driving himself to the front lines of Syrian civil warBashar al-Assad boasted his government's progress in Syria's seven-year civil war with a video of himself driving to meet soldiers near a rebel pocket in Damascus.\"The road is open... everything is running now in the city and in Syria,\" the Syrian president told the camera in the footage filmed from the passenger seat of his car.\"Everyone is returning to the government, as you see.

It has proposed the establishment of a new alternative international investigative body to carry out the work.

As a result, thousands of leaked photos mean prosecutors have far stronger evidence of war crimes than what existed to convict the Nazis at Nuremberg, said Rapp, the former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues under President Barack Obama.The documents amassed so far form a \"paper trail of war crimes\" noteworthy for their specificity, according to Engels, who requested NBC News not reveal the location of the group's office out of concern for investigators' safety and the security of the evidence. The documents are stored in a vault.The group's 140-person staff is made up of lawyers, investigators, and translators. That includes more than 40 \"document hunters\" in Syria whose mission is to extract material produced by the regime, authorizing the detention, torture, and execution of people for suspected anti-government activity.More on MSNBC's \"On Assignment with Richard Engel\" Friday at 9 p.m. ETDocuments identify who in the regime signed off on what, who was targeted, and why. In some cases where the documents indicate that a prisoner admitted to participating in anti-regime activity, CIJA tracked down the accused, who later said their confessions were extracted through torture.The organization was founded by Bill Wiley, a Canadian former war crimes investigator, as news reports began surfacing of widespread abuses by the Assad regime in 2011. It receives funding from Western countries, including the British and Canadian governments, to carry out its work.Added to the trove of documents is vital visual evidence: roughly 50,000 photos shot between the start of the war in 2011 and 2013, cataloging more than 6,700 victims of torture by pro-regime forces. They were taken by a forensic photographer known by the pseudonym Caesar who worked for the Syrian military and smuggled them out of the country on hard drives in 2013.Assad has disputed the veracity of the photos, but Human Rights Watch called the images authentic. The New York-based group confirmed the identity of 27 victims in the photos through interview with relatives, while former prisoners and defectors have corroborated the widespread torture in government prisons. In a separate analysis, the FBI confirmed a portion of the photo trove as authentic. So did a U.N. report.Caesar's photos show emaciated corpses, many stripped naked, arrayed on the ground \u2014 some with gouged-out eyes, bloodied genitals, and severed fingers. Many show signs of bruises, burn marks, and gashes covering discolored skin. While most of the images are too graphic to air or publish, NBC News has included three below to illustrate the treatment thought to have been meted out to Syrian detainees.Other investigators and activists have also collected testimony, images and videos documenting atrocities committed by all sides during Syria's war, a U.N. quasi-prosecutorial body has said. The team announced Monday that it is preparing case files and has engaged with war crimes investigative units of different countries including in Europe, whose courts can exercise universal jurisdiction to prosecute.CIJA's goal is to prove government officials' individual criminal culpability, from the highest echelons in Damascus down to the provincial level. The Syrian government's formalized command-and-control structure, as well as its careful record-keeping, make that work easier.The Syrian government is \"process driven,\" Engels said. Directives \u2014 even those authorizing torture \u2014 were documented \"to make sure that everyone does what they're supposed to be doing.\"CIJA's work is logistically difficult and comes with significant risks. Over the course of the war, where rebels seized regime territory, CIJA's document hunters entered abandoned government facilities and extracted material \u2014 USBs, computer hard drives, reams of paper \u2014 that might contain evidence of war crimes.\u201cThey are dead-set against justice.\u201dNext they had to safely store the material, and when possible, smuggle it through checkpoints and out of Syria. Engels says no one directly employed by CIJA was ever killed in the process, but people who worked closely with the team were.Once the documents are ferried out of Syria, the rest of the CIJA team sifts through them to build cases for future criminal prosecutions.Despite what CIJA and other investigators consider to be clear and overwhelming evidence of war crimes by Assad's government, the regime remains more firmly entrenched than at any other point in the war due in large part to the support of Russia, Iran and Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah.Now a concern among human rights lawyers pursuing a case against Assad's government is that victims of the regime will never see officials held to account.Criminal prosecutions within an international tribunal seem increasingly unlikely. For a case to come before the International Criminal Court, it has to be referred there by the United Nations Security Council. Russia and China, two of five veto-wielding members on the council, quashed such a move in 2014.\"They are dead-set against justice,\" Rapp said. \"They are dead set against any kind of investigation that's independent.\"So in place of an international tribunal, Engels and Rapp have been focusing on lower level domestic prosecutions, and are helping authorities issue arrest warrants and build cases against Syrian government functionaries who have since left the country for the West. Last year alone, Rapp says he fielded 400 requests from law enforcement officials in 12 different countries, including the FBI.In September, prosecutors in Sweden issued the first war crimes conviction of a Syrian army soldier who had sought asylum in the country: eight months in prison for violating personal dignity by posing with his foot on five corpses in a photo.Rapp and Engels admit that such small fare is an unsatisfactory answer to the millions displaced, wounded or left grieving loved ones killed in the war and who want to see Assad held accountable.\"It won't be as good as in an international court, but that's the only alternative we have right now,\" Rapp said."}{"head": "Their love was born in heady days of protest.

The optimistic protests had yet to descend into a vicious civil war. The Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta \u2014 where Douma is \u2014 had not become \"hell on Earth,\" and hundreds of thousands had yet to die in violence that has driven millions from their homes.\"I just want my love to be with me even if he's dead. Is it an impossible dream?\"It was a giddy time. She, a human rights lawyer, and he, a self-taught software engineer, became inseparable and they attended demonstrations together, desperately hoping for change from the government of President Bashar al-Assad.But the relationship fell victim to the war, which is now in its eighth year. Khartabil was arrested in March 2012 \u2014 two weeks before his wedding \u2014 and, as Safadi learned in August, he was executed in 2015. She has yet to receive official notice from the regime that Khartabil is dead.Instead, Safadi waits, and hurts.For more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News\" tonight\"I want to go there and to talk to him like I used to do,\" she said.Safadi, a small, soft-spoken woman with a steely resolve, has made it her mission to bury her beloved and mourn his loss at a gravesite, but she has been told nothing about the return of his body.Khartabil, whose computer skills were widely known among programmers outside Syria, had long wanted to make the internet more accessible in his own country. Active as an open-source software developer, he was known to translate Wikipedia entries from English into Arabic. When anti-government protests erupted in Syria, he used his tech savvy to get around strict government censorship and posted hundreds of videos of demonstrations online so the world would learn what was happening inside the country.A video recorded just months after Khartabil and Safadi met shows them beaming, playfully describing the beginning of their relationship.\"We expected everything was going to be solved, and we would win,\" Safadi said as she watched the video alongside NBC News, referring to the changes they desperately hoped for.But beneath the optimism ran an undercurrent of foreboding. Shortly after the demonstrations began, Assad responded with a bloody crackdown. Unarmed protesters were mowed down by bullets and tank shells. Still more were detained and tortured.As the euphoria of the protests dissipated and darkness descended, Khartabil realized he had now something to lose.\"I never had a problem with them arresting me before we got engaged, but now I'm worried about her,\" he said of Safadi in the same video.\"I am always worried about him,\" Safadi said in the same video. \"I have fears.\"Khartabil's best friend, Jon Phillips, was also concerned about his safety. A decade earlier, while still a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, Philips had met Khartabil online. The pair bonded over a mutual love of computers, collaborating on projects and meeting regularly at conferences around the world.Phillips remembered their last meeting at a conference in Poland in early 2012, where he implored Khartabil not to return to Syria. His response was \"it's OK, it's OK,\" Phillips recalled.On March 12, 2012, Khartabil disappeared.Safadi embarked on a desperate search for him. Nearly 10 months later, she found him in an overcrowded prison in a Damascus suburb.Khartabil told Safadi that he had been kept in solitary confinement in a military prison for nearly nine months and been tortured daily and starved. A military prosecutor charged him with \"spying for an enemy state.\" There was no trial.He was later transferred to civilian detention where he met a journalist, Wael Saad al-Deen. The two talked every day, kept each other going with discussions of love, poetry and their revolution.Al-Deen fled Syria after being released on bail and is now seeking asylum in Canada.The horrors of Syria's prisons, including torture and deprivation, have been documented. An estimated 60,000 people died while in government detention from 2011 to 2016, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.The Syrian regime has called charges of torture and extrajudicial killings in its prisons \"baseless.\"Although Khartabil was imprisoned, with no prospect of being released, the couple proceeded with the wedding. Safadi's parents came to witness the vows, which the two exchanged through prison bars.With the hashtag #FreeBassel, Phillips launched an international campaign to raise awareness of Khartabil's detention. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales recorded an online video in support. Then-Secretary of State John Kerry called Khartabil a prisoner of conscience.In 2015, almost three years into his arrest, Khartabil disappeared again. He phoned Safadi before the guards took him away. She began searching.Last August, Safadi finally learned the truth: Khartabil had been executed just a few days after he was taken from prison, according to her sources who have seen official documents authorizing the execution. The Syrian regime has not confirmed his death.\"I didn't see the body,\" Safadi said. \"Like all Syrians, I didn't get a death certificate because he was executed and they still deny this.\"Phillips is still haunted by that last exchange with his friend. \"We absolutely failed,\" he said. \"We did not get him out.\"Al-Deen, for his part, is also preoccupied with his final moments with Khartabil. \"I can't forget him.\"Safadi, who now lives in Beirut, has published a collection of poems written while Khartabil was in prison. It is titled \"Waiting.\"She continues to wait \u2014 for a death certificate, for the return of her husband's body.\"I want a grave for Bassel,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"I just want my love to be with me even if he's dead.

Why Trump's empty threats don't scare Bashar al-Assad | ViewThere is a dynamic tension in every organization, and even a well-led White House has its flashes of conflict and even chaos. For example, although it was focused intensely on the single objective of winning the Civil War, the Abraham Lincoln presidency was riven with rivalries, jealousies and disorganization. Still, the Trump White House seems to be the textbook example of dysfunction.Fulfilling President Donald Trump's hyperbolic campaign promises has proved to be a very difficult task indeed. Most recently, his pledge to build a border wall funded by Mexico has resulted in essentially the same decision that has been made by previous administrations: sending a few National Guard troops to provide aviation, administration, logistical and intelligence support.But perhaps this administration's most striking inconsistency has been regarding America's role and attitude towards Syria. On March 29, Trump stated unequivocally that he wanted our troops out of Syria \"very soon.\" Meanwhile, several senior officers, including Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who is responsible for the region, noted that in fact \"the hard part, I think, is in front of us, and that is stabilizing these areas, consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes.\"This is not the first time that an extemporaneous pronouncement from Trump has seemed to be at odds with the opinions of senior officials. But never has an administration been so consistently inconsistent on matters of national security.Soon after Trump's comment about leaving Syria, President Bashar al-Assadallegedly gassed to death dozens of Syrians%20with%20what%20is%20generally%20believed%20to%20be%20chlorine) (again). Trump responded by tacitly reneging on his pledge to disengage from Syria and announcing that he was meeting with his generals to discuss \"making some major decisions in the next 24 to 48 hours.\"If history is any guide, it is likely Trump will launch missile strikes against a few Syrian airfields and perhaps at Syrian command-and-control headquarters. After all, this week marks almost exactly one year since Trump launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria in response to another chemical weapons attack. But it is just as likely that Assad will shrug such actions off and carry on with his atrocities, much the same as he has since the insurrection began seven years ago. Assad, Russia and Iran are in it for the long haul, and we are not.So what, if anything, is to be made of the Syrian mess and our role in it? Perhaps it is worthwhile to examine briefly how the United States got to this point in the first place.The U.S. was originally vociferous about its opposition to the Assad regime and publicly supportive of the multifarious forces in rebellion to it. President Barack Obama argued that Assad must resign, and announced that Assad's further use of chemical weapons would not be tolerated. With perhaps a better understanding of American political will than Obama had, however, Assad promptly used chemical weapons again \u2014 and America did nothing but complain.Whether or not you agree with an isolationist \u2014 at least hands off \u2014 foreign policy, it seems clear that nations should not make threats about punishment without the will to follow through.As Russia and Iran became more and more involved in the fray between 2013 and 2015, America became even more skittish. Wanting to keep its hands as clean as possible, the Pentagon's brain trust shifted its objective to eliminating ISIS, which had taken up residence in a country only partially controlled from Damascus.America sent troops to train indigenous Syrian rebel forces, but the greatest battlefield successes were spearheaded by Kurdish allies. Their determination, and America's devastating airpower, proved to be a lethal combination. The dreams of ISIS leaders to occupy territory and create a \"caliphate\" eventually made the organization easier to locate and destroy, and it is now nearly eliminated as a military force in Syria.Now Kurds themselves are being targeted, by Syrian allies Russia and Iran but and also by Turkey \u2014 an American NATO ally, in theory at least \u2014 which views the Kurds as a terrorist organization. This means that when America does leave Syria, the Kurds will be on their own. Without American forward air controllers and air support, they will have a very unpleasant time.More troubling, ISIS could become a resurgent force in the large swaths of Syria that Assad can't dominate and the U.S. has vacated. In this worst-case scenario, all of our efforts will have been in vain.And Russia and Iran? They have different, but complimentary, objectives. Russia wants influence in the region, but what it really loves is warm-water ports in the Mediterranean. Access via the Black Sea is controlled by the Turks at the Bosphorus, making control of Syrian coastline a tantalizing prospect. America and Turkey are on the outs at the moment, but in a pinch Russia can't trust the Turks to let it through the strait.The perception that America can project its power at will remains a pervasive one stateside \u2014 including in Washington. And occasionally it has, for good and ill. But the world has changed dramatically since the war in Vietnam, the Soviet Union dissolved and the U.S. became complacent about its technology and the purity of our democracy.Syria may seem like an underdeveloped country whose fate is not the least bit connected to ours.

A\u00a0conflict that began as a peaceful uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime escalated into a full-scale civil war that is now one of this century's deadliest.Along the way, the Syrian conflict allowed\u00a0Islamic State extremists\u00a0to flourish, created\u00a0the world's worst refugee crisis since World War II and\u00a0exacerbated an international power struggle.\u00a0After seven years of relentless bloodshed, here is a recap of the crisis:Economic problems and a\u00a0lack of freedom\u00a0caused resentment toward Assad's authoritarian rule. His forces responded to protesters in 2011 by killing hundreds of them and imprisoning many more as other pro-democracy uprisings known as the Arab Spring were taking place across the Middle East.As public anger\u00a0intensified, the\u00a0growing chaos attracted extremist fighters\u00a0throughout the region, including remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq and an offshoot that became the Islamic State, or ISIS. Eventually, a full\u00a0Syrian rebellion was mounted against Assad's regime. Some of these rebel groups started\u00a0fighting each other as well as Assad's military forces because of sectarian divisions, complicating the situation.\u00a0The numbers speak for themselves:The United States started arming and providing\u00a0military air cover in 2014 for anti-Assad rebel groups who were also\u00a0waging war against ISIS. Washington also began working with Syrian Kurds, one of the strongest\u00a0partners in the fight against ISIS. After that support appeared to turn the tide against Assad, Russia \u2014\u00a0a longtime Syrian ally \u2014\u00a0entered the conflict in 2015 to shore up Assad's struggling regime. In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to assert his country's power on the world stage.\u00a0Iran provided much-needed ground troops for the Assad regime, funneling money and fighters through the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group to further establish a strong presence in the region. Israel has been indirectly involved as it fears Iran could use Syrian territory to stage attacks on Israel or transfer weapons to Hezbollah. Iran is Israel\u2019s arch-enemy and has sworn to destroy the country.\u00a0\u00a0Turkey, Syria's northern neighbor, extended its ground operations into Syria, fearing the conflict could embolden Turkey's large population of Kurds to demand independence. In recent days, Turkish troops surrounded the Kurdish-held city of Afrin,\u00a0forcing hundreds of civilians to flee.With so many international\u00a0forces operating in such close proximity, a danger exists that any mistake\u00a0could trigger a\u00a0larger\u00a0conflict outside Syria.Over the years, there have been various peace talks and United Nations resolutions calling for cease-fires to allow aid to reach areas where civilians were\u00a0trapped. The cease-fires did not last or were violated. And most of the peace talks have stumbled on a major sticking point: the fate of Assad.\u00a0Mara Karlin, an intelligence and security expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, wrote in a February blog post, that \"the fundamental debate for Washington going forward must focus on whether counterterrorism or broader geopolitical affairs should be the priority in Syria.\"She noted that her congressional testimony in 2012 about Syria is still relevant.\u00a0The Syrian conflict \"will not end with Bashar Assad voluntarily stepping aside,\u00a0or choosing exile.

His forces responded to protesters in 2011 by killing hundreds of them and imprisoning many more as other pro-democracy uprisings known as the Arab Spring were taking place across the Middle East.As public anger\u00a0intensified, the\u00a0growing chaos attracted extremist fighters\u00a0throughout the region, including remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq and an offshoot that became the Islamic State, or ISIS. Eventually, a full\u00a0Syrian rebellion was mounted against Assad's regime. Some of these rebel groups started\u00a0fighting each other as well as Assad's military forces because of sectarian divisions, complicating the situation.According to the U.N.,\u00a0400,000 Syrians have been killed and more than\u00a0half of the country's 20 million, pre-war population has been displaced. About 5.5 million Syrians have fled abroad \u2014 95% of them\u00a0in just five countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt), according to humanitarian groups.Assad's latest offensive is aimed at securing the region around the capital Damascus. The gas attack was in a region just outside the city. Thousands of\u00a0civilians remained trapped in opposition-held suburbs of Syria's capital Damascus as\u00a0Assad's government wages a relentless bombing campaign to retake the area.About a third of Syria's housing and half of its educational and medical facilities have been destroyed, according to a\u00a02017 World Bank report.\u00a0Of Syria's estimated 10 million children, 8.6 million are in dire need of assistance, up from about a half-million after the first year of war. Nearly 6 million children are displaced or living as refugees, and about 2.5 million are out of school.\u00a0The United States has about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria, based mostly\u00a0in northeast Syria. Their mission is straightforward: to support local militias fighting the Islamic State. The troops are serving as advisers and providing other support, including air power. The U.S. troops\u00a0are not in conflict with Assad's armed forces or their Iranian and Russian backers. The U.S. is backing diplomatic efforts to end the conflict but is attempting to fight the Islamic State without taking sides in the civil war.The biggest risk is an attack on Assad's forces that ends up drawing world powers into a global conflict. A year ago the Trump administration authorized a strike on Assad's regime in retaliation for a similar nerve agent attack. The U.S. strike was calibrated so that it would punish the Assad regime without collapsing Assad's government or drawing Russia and Iran into the conflict. The Trump administration may be contemplating a more severe strike this time, but it will need to do so carefully to avoid unintended consequences.The conflict has turned into a proxy war. The United States started arming and providing\u00a0military air cover in 2014 for anti-Assad rebel groups who were also\u00a0waging war against ISIS. Washington also began working with Syrian Kurds, one of the strongest\u00a0partners in the fight against ISIS. After that support appeared to turn the tide against Assad, Russia \u2014\u00a0a longtime Syrian ally \u2014\u00a0entered the conflict in 2015 to shore up Assad's struggling regime. In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to assert his country's power on the world stage.Iran provided much-needed ground troops for the Assad regime, funneling money and fighters through the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group to further establish a strong presence in the region. Israel has been indirectly involved as it fears Iran could use Syrian territory to stage attacks on Israel or transfer weapons to Hezbollah. Iran is Israel\u2019s arch-enemy and has sworn to destroy the country.Turkey, Syria's northern neighbor, extended its ground operations into Syria, fearing the conflict could embolden Turkey's large population of Kurds to demand independence. In recent days, Turkish troops surrounded the Kurdish-held city of Afrin,\u00a0forcing hundreds of civilians to flee.\u00a0Over the years, there have been various peace talks and United Nations resolutions calling for cease-fires to allow aid to reach areas where civilians were\u00a0trapped. The cease-fires did not last or were violated. And most of the peace talks have stumbled on a major sticking point: the fate of Assad.\u00a0Mara Karlin, an intelligence and security expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, wrote in a February blog post, that \"the fundamental debate for Washington going forward must focus on whether counterterrorism or broader geopolitical affairs should be the priority in Syria.\"She noted that her congressional testimony in 2012 about Syria is still relevant.\u00a0The Syrian conflict \"will not end with Bashar Assad voluntarily stepping aside,\u00a0or choosing exile. It will not end with him making sufficient reforms to enable a transparent and free Syrian state. Let me be clear: continued oppression and violence in Syria will continue,\" she wrote in 2012.\u00a0Contributing: Alan Gomez\n    Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the U.S. is not ruling out military air strikes against Syria in response to the government's alleged use of toxic gas against civilians.

An Israeli F-16 fighter jet retaliated by attacking targets in Syria, before it\u00a0was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft fire, injuring the two pilots. It was the\u00a0first time in more than a decade that an Israeli jet was lost during combat, according to The Jerusalem Post.\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the attack Sunday, saying\u00a0his country delivered \"severe blows to the Iranian and Syrian forces.\"\"We will continue to strike at every attempt to strike at us,\" he told his Cabinet.\u00a0The powder keg was lit in March 2011, amid the Arab Spring uprisings against autocratic regimes throughout the Arab World. A group in Syria showing their support were arrested and tortured by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, prompting thousands to protest.Assad's forces responded by\u00a0killing dozens, igniting a full-blown civil war to overthrow the regime.\u00a0The growing\u00a0chaos attracted terrorists throughout the region, including remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq and an offshoot that became the Islamic State, or ISIS.\u00a0By 2014, ISIS militants began seizing large swaths of territory in Syria, including Raqqa as its de facto capital and the oil region\u00a0Deir ez-Zor, as well as territory in Iraq.\u00a0A handout photo from the Syrian Arab news agency SANA shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad speaking at a conference in Damascus, Syria, on Nov. 14, 2017.\u00a0(Photo: SANA handout via EPA-EFE)One by one, foreign countries started getting involved.\u2022The United States wants to root out ISIS.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the Syrian conflict to assert his country's power on the world stage.\u00a0\u00a0\u2022Iran also stepped in to provide much-needed ground troops for the Assad regime, funneling money and fighters through the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group to further establish\u00a0a strong presence in the region.\u2022Syria's northern neighbor of Turkey also became engaged after it absorbed many refugees escaping the civil war. But Turkey also fears the conflict could embolden its large population of Kurds to demand independence.\u00a0Since January, Turkey\u2019s military started extending its ground operations into eastern Syria, near where U.S.-led coalition forces have been battling the remnants of ISIS.\u2022Israel fears Iran could use Syrian territory to stage attacks on its small country or transfer weapons to Hezbollah,\u00a0Lebanon\u2019s Iranian-backed militant group. Iran is Israel\u2019s arch-enemy and has sworn to destroy Israel. Jerusalem for years has been trying to make sure that Tehran does not acquire nuclear weapons.\u2022In the shadows, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East have secretly backed armed fighters to overthrow Assad's regime.\u00a0All those forces operating in such close proximity creates a constant risk of mistakes that could trigger another conflict outside Syria.On Saturday, Kurdish forces\u00a0shot down a Turkish military helicopter, the first officially confirmed loss of a Turkish aircraft over Syria.\u00a0In January, a Russian fighter jet flew within 5\u00a0feet of a U.S. military reconnaissance plane before crossing through the U.S. aircraft\u2019s flight path over the Black Sea, according to the Military Times.The U.S. pursuing ISIS fighters\u00a0has\u00a0mistakenly killed Syrian forces, and Russia\u00a0has accidentally struck U.S.-backed forces.\u00a0All sides have warned that such accidents could lead to larger wars.Russian airstrikes have helped Assad reclaim more control over his country. Assad's forces have retaken the cities of Raqqa and Aleppo from ISIS control, although small pockets of fighters still exist in parts of the country.The Pentagon has said ISIS fighters have been cleared from more than 98% of the territory they held at their peak in 2014 and 2015. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in January that the U.S. is committed to keeping a military presence in Syria to make sure ISIS does not regain a foothold.\u00a0The civil war has killed nearly a half-million people and forced 5 million Syrians to flee, the majority to neighboring Lebanon and Jordan. More than 1 million\u00a0refugees landed in\u00a0Europe, contributing to biggest\u00a0migration crisis since World War II.According to the United Nations, nearly 3 million Syrian children have lived their entire lives gripped by civil war.The civil war has destroyed historic cities such as Palmyra, which ISIS blew up in 2015.Russia is still bombing areas outside Damascus not controlled by the regime.

It has also further strained relations between Turkey and the U.S. and raised questions about the effectiveness of the U.S. strategy to root out Islamic State militants in Syria.\u00a0Secretary of State Rex Tillerson laid out a new strategy Jan. 17 in a speech at Stanford University. He committed the U.S. to an open-ended troop presence in northeast Syria. The goals: To fight Islamic State and groups linked to al-Qaeda, counter Iranian influence in the region and get Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad out of power.The U.S. plan includes further cooperation with Syrian Kurdish militants, something that has infuriated Turkey and sparked its operation against Syrian-Kurdish militants in Afrin.Analysts such as Faysal Itani, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, doubt whether such an objective is possible.Troops and aid\u00a0committed to by the Trump administration to Syria are not nearly enough to achieve such lofty goals, Itani said.\u00a0 Refugee returns would require expensive, large-scale reconstruction and diplomacy\u00a0will not get Assad to step aside, he said.\u00a0If the U.S. does not resolve its differences with\u00a0Turkey\u00a0over Syria's Kurdish militias, basic stability\u00a0is even more difficult.\u00a0The U.S. has not committed enough troops or money to stabilize the country and pave the way for a peaceful democratic transition, Itani said. In addition, the U.S. must navigate the demands of countries on Syria\u2019s borders, such as Turkey, to get regional stability.On Friday, after a two day visit to Ankara by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the two countries agreed to open dialogue in an effort to mend ties damaged by their difference over Kurdish militants in Syria.Tillerson said at a press conference with foreign minister\u00a0Mevlut Cavusoglu, that\u00a0Turkey and the U.S. had hit a \"bit of a crisis point in the relationship,\" but that the countries would\u00a0\"act together from this point forward.\"More: Rex Tillerson says U.S. and Turkey have 'same goals' in Syria. Here's why it mattersStill, no agreement was made to solve the differences between the two countries and Tillerson and Cavusoglu reiterated their conflicting stances.\"Our worries were in direct relation to direct threats that we were receiving about the YPG attacking our citizens, because our people are dying,\"\u00a0said Cavusoglu,\u00a0He said\u00a0around 100 Turkish citizens and Syrians were killed by missiles or by arms\u00a0coming from Afrin.The battle raging in the northern Syrian region of Afrin pits Turkey, a NATO ally, against the People\u2019s Protection Unit (YPG), a Kurdish-Syrian group supported by the U.S. that has seized control of large swaths of land in Syria from Assad's\u00a0government.While the U.S. sees the YPG forces as a helpful ally\u00a0and important part\u00a0of the Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against Assad and the Islamic State, the Turkish government sees the YPG as part of a troublesome Kurdish separatist group that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey.\u00a0The Turkish government blames the YPG for the deaths of seven civilians. Scores of others have been injured in more than 100 attacks on southern Turkey. The YPG denies targeting the civilians.An end to tensions between Turkey and the U.S.\u00a0seems distant because the countries have different priorities, said Hassan Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. While the U.S. is most concerned with defeating the Islamic State, Turkey is most concern with the\u00a0YPG, he said.At the same time, the Kurdish fighters of the YPG claim the U.S. isn\u2019t doing enough to defend the YPG in Afrin from Turkish attacks, Itani noted. Recently, Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Edogan threatened to attack Manbij, the U.S.-controlled territory in eastern Syria where American troops are stationed alongside Kurdish rebels.That instability in Afrin is creating more refugees. The United Nations says the most recent fighting has displaced between 15,000 and 30,000 people.Syrian refugees like the Barads now account for a third of Reyhanli\u2019s population\u00a0and they are running out of places to go.\u00a0Hani\u00a0Barad\u2019s entire extended family \u2014 12 people \u2014 spent two weeks hunkered down in a four-bedroom apartment.Barad\u2019s brother-in-law Mohammed Rahhal stayed there with his mother, Khadija Gazal, 67, after fighting near\u00a0his own apartment became too loud.\u201cIt sounded like explosions all the time and the house was shaking,\u201d said Rahhal, who eventually plans to move to Slovenia to be with his wife. \u201cMy mom is scared and doesn\u2019t want to stay there.\u201dRahhal\u2019s sister Eatimad Rahhal, five months pregnant with her fourth child, missed her last medical appointment and her children were kept home from school.\u00a0\u201cWhen planes attack your village, you forget everything and move your children.

There were apparently no casualties and\u00a0no mistaken hits on Russian forces, and the raid seems to have been a textbook example of a surgical strike. The justified and proportionate action had broad international support\u00a0and bipartisan political backing inside the United States.The raid was punitive, punishing the Assad regime for conducting illegal and inhuman chemical attacks on civilians. More important,\u00a0the raid was intended to have a deterrent effect, to convince Syrian decision-makers that it would be unwise to conduct any future such chemical attacks, in which case they would pay an escalating price.It is instructive to compare Friday\u00a0night\u2019s raid to the 2017 response to Syria\u2019s chemical attack at Khan Sheikhoun. The latest raid used more and varied weaponry, involved more counties, and hit more targets than in 2017. Significantly, the targets were higher up the system \u2014\u00a0not just aimed at the units that conducted the attacks like in 2017, but at chemical weapons stockpiles, a research, development and testing facility, and a command post. Friday\u00a0night\u2019s raid even touched the center of the highly defended capital Damascus, telegraphing to the Syrians that they have nowhere to hide.The implicit message to the Assad regime is that if chemical weapons are used again, the response will involve even more weapons and\u00a0potentially more countries, and hit targets even higher in the system. These could include senior military command and control nodes and government decision-makers. Ultimately, this chain of escalation leads to Bashar Assad himself. If he continues to use chemical weapons, he will have to wonder how many steps there are between the latest\u00a0raid and one that could potentially put him in the crosshairs.More: Syria's Assad picked the wrong time to launch a chemical attack on civiliansOur View: Syria cries out for American clarity, not chaosThe Damascus regime should reflect on the fundamental disutility of chemical weapons. They are rightly abhorred by the international community. They are of questionable battlefield use, indiscriminate, unpredictable and contaminating, usually employed where fronts are relatively static such as in World War I\u00a0or the Iran/Iraq War in the 1980s. They are also used as terror weapons, such as during the latter conflict when Iraqi official Ali Hassan al-Majid, aka \u201cChemical Ali,\u201d used chemical weapons to punish, intimidate and slaughter Kurds who were suspected of disloyalty to Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. Chemical Ali was later tried by the post-Saddam government and found guilty for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He was executed in 2010.The Assad regime is following the Chemical Ali pattern, employing the weapons against civilians in rebel-held areas and whoever else is in the target zone. So a strong war crimes case can be made, both for the use of the weapons, which is illegal under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and also for the way they are being used, to murder non-combatants. Investigating and documenting these crimes will play an increasingly important role as the military phase of the Syrian civil war winds down and diplomatic efforts ramp up.The Trump administration is eager to restart the United Nations-sponsored Geneva process that will hopefully develop a framework for a more inclusive and democratic post-conflict Syria. In the long run, this is the most important aspect of American involvement in the Syria crisis, since the Trump administration rightly is not seeking to escalate direct U.S.\u00a0military involvement on the ground. The strike was a limited response to a specific and illegal chemical attack. But the White House has also said that the United States would employ broader elements of national power, particularly economic and diplomatic measures.\u00a0Friday night\u2019s action should be viewed both as strategic messaging to deter future Syrian chemical attacks, and\u00a0as part of a broader concept for quickly resolving the civil war on favorable terms. Meanwhile, the Assad regime and its allies have been given an instructive example of the vast capabilities of the multinational forces that were arrayed against them Friday, for one hour in their seven-year war.

What were they designed to accomplish? And are we now locked into a forever war in Syria?Here are our preliminary takeaways:\u00a0Perhaps the most important takeaway was that in Trumpland, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis still dominates the decision-making process on the use of military force. If reports that some were pushing for more comprehensive strikes are accurate, then Mattis won this round. No doubt the military participation of the British and French \u2014 both of whom were looking for a tough but narrow response that would not trigger Russian and Iranian escalation or drag them into Syria\u2019s civil war, helped strengthen Mattis\u2019 hand.\u00a0But the secretary was clearly worried about a set of targets that might have triggered Russian and Iranian retaliation. And despite tweets warning Russian leader Vladimir\u00a0Putin about smart missiles headed his way, Trump took Mattis'\u00a0counsel.\u00a0The attack was designed to achieve two limited purposes: First, to punish Assad for his use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians and, second, to deter Assad from launching new chemical weapon attacks by degrading his capacity to conduct such operations. The president and his advisers likely considered a broad range of goals for U.S\u00a0military response \u2014 everything from dealing a crippling blow to the Assad regime\u2019s broader military capabilities, attacking Russian and Iranian forces to fundamentally alter the balance of forces on the ground to change the course of the Syrian civil war, and increasing U.S. leverage to negotiate a comprehensive peace settlement that would force Assad from power.\u00a0In the end, these ambitious \u2014 and riskier \u2014 objectives, which would have more deeply enmeshed the United States\u00a0in Syria\u2019s civil war, were rejected in favor of a more prudent and restrained response that, while larger and more destructive than the U.S. strike a year ago, was focused exclusively on crippling Syria\u2019s chemical weapons infrastructure.It remains to be seen whether the strike will deter Assad from future\u00a0 chemical weapons use, but it is premature to declare, as the president tweeted this morning, \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d The U.S. military retaliation almost a year ago to Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons in the city of Khan Sheikhoun did not deter the regime from conducting multiple chlorine gas attacks over the past year.\u00a0The damage from that attack against aircraft used to deliver such weapons, however, was limited and the targets that were successfully destroyed Friday\u00a0night \u2014 research, development\u00a0and storage facilities \u2014 were central to Assad\u2019s chemical production capabilities. That said, Assad believes he is in an existential struggle for his survival and the survival of his regime, and he is determined to reassert the government\u2019s control over all of Syrian territory.\u00a0As Trump often says, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens.\u201d\u00a0More: Donald Trump's textbook surgical strike sent the right message to Syria, Bashar AssadOur View: Syria cries out for American clarity, not chaosIt\u2019s not clear from the Defense Department briefings whether additional U.S. strikes would be used only if Assad uses chemicals again; whether that applies only to the use of certain agents like sarin or to chlorine, which America\u00a0has largely ignored; and whether the United States\u00a0might strike pre-emptively if it discovers either preparation for a chemical weapons attack or if intelligence exists on new stockpiles of chemical agents. The logic appears to be that these strikes will set back the Syrian chemical program; that Assad won\u2019t use them again; and that the Russians will pressure him not to do so. None of these assumptions can possibly be substantiated now. And there\u2019s a strong possibility that America\u00a0may need to \u201cmow the grass\u201d again if/when Assad deploys chemicals again.\u00a0Critics of this administration and its predecessor have argued that the United States\u00a0needs a comprehensive policy to end Syria\u2019s civil war, and that Washington must play a leading role in this effort. The reality is that this administration has a policy, but it\u2019s minimalist and is largely focused on two basic objectives: defeating the Islamic State terrorist organization,\u00a0and deterring Assad from using chemical weapons. We pay lip service to a diplomatic settlement to remove Assad and rebuilding the country. But the inconvenient truths are Assad and his allies have won the war;\u00a0America\u00a0lacks the leverage to alter the dynamics of war and peace in Syria;\u00a0our interest in Syria is not nearly as vital as Assad\u2019s, Russia\u2019s or Iran\u2019s;\u00a0and the United States is unwilling to take ownership of putting the broken land of Syria back together again.\u00a0The bottom line, while far from perfect: The Trump administration's response is better than the alternatives in the land of lousy options.\u00a0This administration, like the last one, has no intention of getting stuck with the check for Syria.Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former State Department adviser and Middle East negotiator, is the author of\u00a0The End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.

Before the latest offensive, it was estimated that 400,000 people were trapped in the besieged region. The rebels first seized the area in 2012,Government forces have made major gains in recent days, leaving just a small fraction of eastern Ghouta under rebel control. President Bashar Assad paid a rare visit to troops on the front lines over the weekend.Syrian and Russian forces have opened a third corridor in eastern Ghouta to allow civilians to leave the town of Harasta, which is home to an estimated 20,000 people. Russia\u2019s Maj. Gen. Vladimir Zolotukhin said 300 civilians and 15 militants have exited through the corridor in the past 24 hours. He said the number of civilians fleeing rebel-held areas has been declining after tens of thousands left in recent days.As in other besieged parts of Syria, government forces have pressed the rebels to enter into local cease-fire agreements under which the militants and their families would relocate to other parts of the country. The Syrian opposition has criticized such agreements, saying they reward the government\u2019s siege tactics and legitimize the forced displacement of civilians from their homes.The Observatory said the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group, which controls Harasta, has reached a cease-fire agreement with the government that will come into effect later Wednesday if there are no violations. Monther Fares, a spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham in eastern Ghouta, said the negotiations are still underway."}{"head": "Why Is the SyrianCivil War Still Raging?", "classes": ["byline-dateline", "interactive-leadin", "summary", "g-body", "g-body", "g-body", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle9", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle10", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle11", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle12", "g-pstyle12", "g-pstyle13", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle14", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle13", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle9", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle10", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle11", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle12", "g-pstyle13", "g-pstyle13", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle14", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle12", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle9", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle10", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle11", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle12", "g-pstyle13", "g-pstyle13", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle14", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle12", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-body", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle5", "g-body", "g-body", "g-body", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-body", "g-body", "g-body", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle6", "g-pstyle7", "g-pstyle8", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle0", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle1", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle2", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle4", "g-pstyle3", "g-pstyle5", "g-pstyle0", "g-body", "g-body", "g-body", "form-hint", "password-hint", "disclaimer", "user-action", "registration-modal-trigger", "disclaimer", "user-action", "login-modal-trigger"], "content": "Advertisement\n\n      By BEN HUBBARD and \n    \nJUGAL K.

Rebels had no unified leadership, and their foreign backers \u2013 including the United States \u2013 cut support, while the government\u2019s backers increased their support. The rebels have been pushed into a few remaining bastions, and no one remains who is willing and able to topple Mr. Assad.Yet government forces are depleted, leaving Mr. Assad without sufficient troops to clear and hold the entire country. Many pro-government forces are militias that can kill rebels but not reimpose governance. Even in areas nominally under Mr. Assad\u2019s control, foreign backers like Iran and Russia often exercise greater control than the Syrian government.And Mr. Assad\u2019s scorched-earth campaigns have killed hundreds of thousands of people and obliterated cities, destroying the social fabric that could help the country unify.

As the group\u2019s territory recedes, some analysts believe the jihadists may turn to terrorist attacks and other insurgency tactics.And the Kurds who expelled the Islamic State will not be able to rule majority-Arab areas, opening up power vacuums that set up this part of the country up for the next conflict.TurkishmovementJan. 22TurkeyKobaniTurkishpositionsJan. 21AzazManbijAfrinKurdishcontrolAleppoRaqqaSyriaAth ThawraTurkishmovementJan. 22TurkeyKobaniTurkishpositionsJan. 21AzazManbijAfrinKurdishcontrolAleppoSyriaAth ThawraTurkeyTurkishmovementJan. 22TurkishpositionsJan. 21AzazKurdishcontrolAfrinAleppoSyriaThe array of international combatants has lately created new flare-ups. Turkey has felt threatened by the predominate fighting group to emerge from Syria\u2019s Kurdish minority, which carved out a de facto ministate along the Turkish border amid the chaos of the civil war. In January, Turkey attacked the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, saying it was seeking to root out terrorists.Then, forces loyal to the Syrian government entered Afrin to join Kurdish militias fighting Turkish troops. The government\u2019s move against the Turks and their allied militias threatened to unravel months of diplomatic efforts between Russia, Turkey and Iran to de-escalate the conflict.Kurdish control of territory in northern Syria further complicates a resolution. Mr. Assad will not accept Kurdish control over the long term, and Turkish leaders have talked about possibly striking the Kurds farther east who have been backed by Americans to fight the Islamic State, an action that could lead to conflict between allies.AdvertisementForgot password?Terms of Service Privacy PolicyDon\u2019t have an account?

In the past two years, the government of President Bashar al-Assad, with Russia\u2019s help, laid siege to residential areas of Aleppo, once the country\u2019s second-largest city, and several other areas controlled by opposition groups, leveling entire neighborhoods. Last weekend, dozens of people died in a suspected chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, prompting the United States, Britain and France to launch retaliatory strikes against Syrian targets early Saturday.In addition, American-led forces have bombed the Islamic State in large patches of eastern Syria, in strikes believed to have left thousands dead. And dozens of armed groups, including fighters backed by Iran, have continued to clash, creating a humanitarian catastrophe that the world is struggling to measure.AdvertisementHistorically, these numbers matter, experts say, because they can have a direct impact on policy, accountability and a global sense of urgency. The legacy of the Holocaust has become inextricably linked with the figure of six million Jews killed in Europe. The staggering death toll of the Rwandan genocide \u2014 one million Tutsis killed in 100 days \u2014 is seared into the framework of that nation\u2019s reconciliation process.Without a clear tally of the deaths, advocates worry that the conflict will simply grind on indefinitely, without a concerted international effort to end it.\u201cWe know from conflicts around the world that we can\u2019t have any sustainable peace if we don\u2019t have accountability,\u201d said Anna Nolan, director of The Syria Campaign, a human rights advocacy group. \u201cThe most critical thing to understand in that situation is who is being killed and who is doing that killing, and without that information we can\u2019t expect the people involved in resolving this conflict to come to the right decisions.\u201dUntil then, local monitoring groups keep the best estimates they can.Fadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said that there were \u201ctens of incidents daily\u201d that raise the death toll, and that monitoring was needed to one day hold perpetrators accountable for potential war crimes.Despite the challenges of access and verification, he sees value in the assessment his group makes, even though he knows they are not perfect.\u201cThis work, what we are doing, we are doing this mainly for our people, for our community, for history itself,\u201d Mr. Ghany said. \u201cSo we are recording these reports in order to say, on this day, in 2018, these people have been killed and because of this, and in this area.\u201dHe believes figures will be vital if peace comes to his country in establishing transitional justice.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose any one life,\u201d he said.The last comprehensive number widely accepted internationally \u2014 470,000 dead \u2014 was issued by the Syrian Center for Policy Research in 2016. The group, which was based in Damascus until that year, was long seen as one of the most reliable local sources because it was not affiliated with the government or aligned with any opposition group.AdvertisementBut now, just getting a death certificate is problematic in Syria, let alone a collective tally of the dead, said Panos Moumtzis, a United Nations assistant secretary general and regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syrian conflict. And civilians make up the largest portion of the death toll.Since there are 18 different authorities issuing documentation, in addition to the government in Syria, Mr. Moumtzis said, many civilians fear that having a death certificate issued by the \u201cwrong authority\u201d could jeopardize their relatives.\u201cEven in death, they worry that one day if they go to declare it they will be in trouble for it,\u201d Mr. Moumtzis said, further complicating tracking.Some monitoring groups are still keeping count from afar, but their numbers vary, are estimates at best, and have not been verified by international groups. These monitors work with networks of contacts in Syria and collect reports on social media and from the news to compile casualty estimates.The most prominent of these groups, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said last month that at least 511,000 people had been killed in the war since March 2011. Many organizations rely on this tally as the best current assessment. The group said in March that it had identified more than 350,000 of those killed by name; the remainder were cases in which it knew deaths had occurred but did not know the victims\u2019 names.Another group, the Violations Documentation Center, which is linked to opposition groups, has a much lower estimate, tallying 188,026 conflict-related deaths from mid-March 2011 until March 2018. But the organization counts just civilian deaths and \u201ctakes a considerable amount of details before entering a name onto our database,\u201d Mona Zeineddine, a member of the group, said by email.Mr. Ghany of the Syrian Network for Human Rights said he used tactics similar to those of the Syrian Observatory to track deaths, but his group counts only civilians. In late March, the network said 217,764 civilians had been killed since the beginning of the war.AdvertisementThe complexity of the conflict, the lack of direct access to conflict areas, and the ethnic and political divisions have made accurate counting an immensely challenging task, he said.Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.\u201cIn most of the incidents, we are unable to visit the places, and in Syria everyday we have tens of violations,\u201d Mr. Ghany said. \u201cEach year has its own challenges and difficulties, and when you overcome one challenge, we face another.\u201dMembers of his group have been detained, and many now live outside Syria. The biggest challenge he now faces is apathy from those on the ground, as the protracted conflict continues.\u201cThe people feel now that there is no hope and no need for all of this human rights work and this human rights documentation,\u201d Mr. Ghany said. \u201cBecause no one is listening to what we are doing.\u201dMost international experts monitoring the conflict use a general figure of over 500,000 deaths, but acknowledge that changing conditions and restricted access make it impossible to know. Many believe it could be higher.Based on that estimate, which takes into account both civilian and combatant deaths, around 2.33 percent of Syria\u2019s prewar population of 22 million has been killed.At the start of the conflict, many journalists and diplomats had relied on the numbers from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which worked with partners on the ground to tally figures. But the United Nations stopped officially counting in 2014, as the war intensified and became more complex.\u201cIt was always a very difficult figure,\u201d a spokesman, Rupert Colville, said at the time. \u201cIt was always very close to the edge in terms of how much we could guarantee the source material was accurate.\u201dIn early 2016, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said he believed an estimated 400,000 people had been killed. But Mr. de Mistura described it as an unrefined estimate based on earlier figures combined with recent reports of violence.AdvertisementNow, most official communications from the United Nations simply cite \u201chundreds of thousands killed.\u201dWhile the numbers vary, all of the groups agree on two things: that the Syrian government is responsible for the majority of the civilian deaths, and that calculating the toll is challenging.\u201cWe often talk about these numbers, whether it\u2019s 400,000 or 500,000, but it\u2019s also about the trauma that is behind each of these numbers,\u201d said Mr. Moumtzis of the United Nations. \u201cIt has become almost mechanical, the number.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s really just a cold figure, but behind it are lives.\u201dA version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2018, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Officials Have Lost Count of How Many Thousands Have Died in Syria\u2019s War.

The USS Donald Cook, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, is within easy striking range of Syria, as is a French frigate with its own cruise missiles. These two ships, possibly aided by a US submarine, are likely to play a role in a strike. \u2013 What are the risks? \u2013The reaction from Assad backer Moscow is unpredictable and Russia has threatened retaliatory action against the United States if missiles are fired at Syria.The Russian army on Wednesday accused the White Helmets civil defense organization of staging a chemical weapons attack in Douma, where observers say more than 40 people died in a gas attack.NBC News reported Tuesday that Russia has learned how to use GPS jammers to limit the capabilities of US drones operating over Syria. \u201cThe US has to be very careful not to accidentally strike Russian targets or kill Russian advisors,\u201d Ben Connable, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, told AFP.\u201cThat significantly limits the number of options available to the United States, because the Russians are embedded in many cases with the Syrians.\u201dConnable warned that if the US accidentally or purposefully kills uniformed Russian soldiers, there would potentially be a dangerous escalation between the two nuclear powers.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the \u2018Operation Python Dance III\u2019,...\u00a0Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe\u2019s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

The gory images of alleged victims of the attack had gone viral.\u00a0 On the eve of the meeting which was ostensibly to discuss the alleged attack and identify its perpetrators,\u00a0 President Donald Trump found the Syrian Government guilty and threatened retaliatory actions.At\u00a0 the Council, as usual, debates gave way to acrimony and threats of retaliatory measures even before any investigation. The United States, US, presented its resolution to the meeting pronouncing Syria guilty and seeking the establishment of\u00a0 an independent agency to investigate the attack. It was vetoed by Russia. Then the verbal cannons were let loose. The U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said: \u201cHistory will record that, on this day, Russia chose protecting a monster (Syrian President Bashar Assad)over the lives of the Syrian people.\u201d To this, the Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, retorted: \u201cYou do not want to hear the fact that no traces of a chemical attack were found in Douma. You simply have been looking for a pretext to justify the use of force against Syria.\u201dHe also said:\u00a0 \u201cWe are using the veto in order to protect international rule of law, peace and security, to make sure that you do not drag the Security Council into your adventures.\u201d To which Haley shot back: \u201cRussia has trashed the credibility of the Council. Whenever we propose anything meaningful on Syria, Russia vetoes it. It is a travesty.\u201dAfter shooting down the American resolution,\u00a0 the Russians presented their two resolutions which as expected, were defeated. So nothing concrete came out of the Security Council meeting.The basic questions; whether indeed there was such an attack or if the images are part of\u00a0 \u2018fake news,\u2019\u00a0 could not be answered. Also, no effective mechanism was put in place to determine this or who carried\u00a0 out the attack and for what purpose. Such tragic matters with potentially\u00a0 serious consequences, have been reduced to the drama of the absurd since 2014 when then President Barack Obama drew the invisible red line and threatened\u00a0 to bomb the Assad government out of existence as it did the Libyan government headed by Muammar Ghadaffi in 2011. Such a blind attack might have handed\u00a0 the terrorist organisations \u2013 ISIS and the al-Nusra Front, their first \u2018Caliphate\u2019 courtesy of the Americans and their North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, allies.If indeed there was\u00a0 an attack, is there the remote possibility that it was carried out by a third force; possibly the terrorists or\u00a0 the Israelis who stand to benefit from a Western attack on Syria? There is the issue of motive; what would be the motive of the Assad government when the war is going so well for it and it is uprooting the last strongholds of the rebels and terrorists especially around Damascus?My argument is not that the Syrian government is incapable of using such deadly chemicals, but there should be a chance of investigating such claims before\u00a0 conclusions are reached. With the Security Council muddling up the waters, it would be difficult for a neutral body to make a conclusive investigation.Rolling from the drama of massive retaliatory expulsion of\u00a0 diplomats by Russia and the West\u00a0 over the use of\u00a0 nerve gas\u00a0 against Russian double spy, Sergei Skripal\u00a0 and his daughter, Yulia in Britain, international diplomacy is being turned into a\u00a0 dangerous circus where one side may make a false move and the other retaliates.Allegations on the use of deadly bombs have been largely discredited since the\u00a0 2003 invasion of Iraq under the false pretense that the Saddam Hussein government\u00a0 not only had weapons of mass destruction, but was about\u00a0 using them.The Syrian Civil War is supposed to have been a\u00a0 civil protest against the Assad government; overnight, it became a war in which sophisticated arms are used, giving\u00a0 the impression that it was not\u00a0 spontaneous after all. It was in that war that we saw the Western-created, Jordanian-trained and Saudi-funded ISIS in action before it took over vast territories especially in Iraq over which it declared a Caliphate. That was when the founders of the Frankenstein ISIS properly re-designated their monster \u2018freedom fighters\u2019 as\u00a0 terrorists.The Syrian conflict has become a mini World War with the most powerful armies; the Russian and American forces involved as well as the Israeli and Turkish armies and\u00a0 countless militia including the Lebanese Hezbollah. In the war, Christian minorities have been massacred and enslaved by the terrorists while at least 465,000 of Syrians have been killed, 6.1 million displaced and 5.5 million turned to refugees. The country itself, is one heap of ruins.Perhaps, the group that has proportionally\u00a0 made the most losses, are the Kurds. They are a homogeneous people sliced into Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria as minorities. When the Iraqi forces which had been decimated by ISIS, was too paralysed, and perhaps, frightened to fight, and Turkey tucked itself into its own side of the borders supporting pockets of Syrian rebels,\u00a0 it was the small but courageous Kurdish fighters, especially the Peshmerga (those who face death)\u00a0\u00a0 that filed out to take on the far superior ISIS forces. With American air support and military supplies, they halted the ISIS and began to push them back in Iraq, while the Syrian military relentlessly pounded them in Syria, forcing them to concede territories.\u00a0 With the near defeat of ISIS, the war-weary Kurds were abandoned by the Americans, leaving them open to be pounded by Turkey.\u00a0 America and the West do not want to annoy the Turks who\u00a0 they are paying to keep illegal immigrants from European shores. They are also aware that the Turks\u00a0\u00a0 are being wooed by the Russians even after downing a Russian fighter jet. The Kurdish Question does not fit into the Western agenda; the Kurds were simply a sacrificial lamb.There are no concerted efforts to end the bloody Syrian Civil War because\u00a0 the West knows that it will be a victory for the Syrian government; so, international\u00a0 power brokers concentrate on negotiating territories, \u2018humanitarian corridor\u2019 \u2018safe passage\u2019 for\u00a0 rebels and their families and ceasefire to allow evacuation of besieged cities.On March 29, Trump announced\u00a0\u00a0 he would be\u00a0 withdrawing American troops from Syria: \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out of Syria like very soon.

A total of 2.7 million people lost their jobs, affecting 11 million who depended on them.Geographically, joblessness was said to be highest in the northeast, in Hasakeh and Raqa provinces, reaching 65 percent in the latter.Fourth quarter private consumption plunged 25.5 percent from a year earlier, with spending focused almost exclusively on food and, for the almost 45 percent of people who have fled their homes, on rent.And that has been made all the more difficult by an astronomical 178 percent rise in prices since 2011.GDP has fallen by 41 percent since the crisis began, equivalent to a loss of $70.9 billion (52.1 billion euros).At the same time, the structure has altered sharply, with most of GDP now represented by domestic trade and government services, while agriculture and industry have slumped.At the same time, military spending has soared from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 15.9 percent last year.The educational system was said to be on the verge of ruin, with 4,000 schools destroyed, damaged or being used to house the internally displaced.The report said that, nationwide, just over half (51.8 percent) of school age children were not going to school. But that figure reached 90 percent in Raqa and Aleppo provinces, and 68 percent in the Damascus provincial countryside.As for the healthcare infrastructure, the report said 61 out 91 public hospitals had been damaged, and 45 percent of them were out of service altogether.The sector has been further hit by health care personnel fleeing or being killed and by the collapse of the nation\u2019s pharmaceutical industry.The report said the overall death toll at the end of 2013 was 130,000, a figure rising to 520,000 if the wounded and maimed were added.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the \u2018Operation Python Dance III\u2019,...\u00a0Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe\u2019s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

weapons in civil war", "classes": [], "content": "Syria on Monday denied ever using chemical weapons in its four-year-old civil war, telling a global watchdog it was cooperating fully with the destruction of its toxic stockpile.Damascus\u2019s rebuttal comes amid growing accusations it is not being transparent with the world\u2019s chemical watchdog and as United Nations efforts are stepped up to track down the perpetrators of deadly chlorine gas attacks in the war-torn country last year.\u201cWe wish here to state categorically that we have never used chlorine or any other toxic chemicals during any incidents or any other operations in the Syrian Arab Republic since the beginning of the crisis and up to this very day,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Moqdad told the annual meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).Damascus rejected \u201cthe false accusations against Syria with respect to its supposed use of chlorine as a weapon in military operations,\u201d he added, speaking in Arabic through an interpreter.The accusations \u201conly serve political agendas, which also aim at diverting our successes in eliminating our chemical weapons,\u201d Moqdad said.But Western countries including the United States and Canada, as well as the European Union, have lambasted Syria, raising doubts about whether President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime is truly committed to ridding his country of all chemical arms.There are \u201cmany uncertainties regarding the dismantling of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons programme, notably the gaps and contradictions contained in Syria\u2019s declarations,\u201d EU representative Jacek Bylica told the meeting in The Hague, attended by delegates from the OPCW\u2019s 192 states.\u201cThese uncertainties lead to doubts as to compliance by Syria with its obligations under the Convention,\u201d Bylica said at the opening of the five-day assembly.Last week the OPCW itself voiced \u201cgrave concern\u201d at the continued use of toxic arms in Syria, despite the regime\u2019s ratification of the UN Convention banning chemical weapons.The OPCW investigations did not directly blame any of the parties in the four-year civil war, aimed at ousting Assad and in which civil groups say more than 250,000 people have been killed.French ambassador Laurent Pic told delegates some reports indicated the presence of helicopters at the time of chemical attacks.\u201cWe all know what that means: the pursuit of relentless oppression by any means, including the most abominable, by a criminal regime against its own people.\u201dThe OPCW \u2014 which won the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 confirmed earlier in November with \u201cutmost confidence\u201d that mustard gas was used in Syria in August during fighting between rebels and jihadists, and \u201clikely\u201d killed a child.OPCW experts also concluded that chlorine gas was likely used in an attack in Idlib province in March.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said a joint UN task team, approved by the Security Council in August to probe chlorine attacks in Syrian villages last year, was up and running in New York and in The Hague \u201cwith plans to set up in Damascus.\u201dThe panel, which comprises 24 experts, is expected to deliver its first report to the Security Council in February, Uzumcu said.The watchdog\u2019s top official told Monday\u2019s meeting \u201csignificant progress\u201d had been made in destroying Syria\u2019s declared chemical weapons stockpile.Under a deal hammered out in 2013 between Russia and the United States following a sarin gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in which hundreds died, the regime joined the UN Convention against chemical weapons and pledged to hand over all such arms to the OPCW for destruction.Some 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons were handed over by Syria, including mustard and sarin gas.The last of the stockpile will be destroyed in the United States by the end of the year, Uzumcu said.But Canadian ambassador Sabine Nolke said: \u201cMore than two years after acceding to this treaty, Syria has failed to demonstrate that it

These claims have been unsubstantiated. Just one month ago Carla Del Ponte, a member of the U.N. Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria concluded that it was the rebel forces inside Syria that had in fact used chemical weapons. The U.N.\u2019s findings were supported by medical staff and victims after a recent chemical attack. So why the sudden rush to judgement? Is the White House \u201dhighly confident\u201d of the chemical weapons narrative because it provides easier access into Syria and to it\u2019s oil and gas reserves?\u201dThis is indeed the question of the century when it comes to the crisis in Syria.The G8 is meeting in Northern Ireland on 17th June 2013 in an attempt to agree on what to do concerning the Syrian civil war. The world is watching with deep concern as the conflict widens and different countries are beginning to take different sides. I urge the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and Hezbollah to stand firmly against the reckless adventurism of the Americans, the British, the French, the Saudis and the Turks in Syria. To arm the Syrian islamists and rebels, the majority of whom hate ethnic minorities, secularists, moderate muslims and christians and who kill those that do not share their narrow and primitive world view is utter madness. Bashir Al Assad will NEVER be removed by force and the secular state of Syria where ethnic minorities and those who share other faiths are protected will never fall. The British, the French, the Americans and their allies will not achieve their objectives in this conflict despite all their lies and disinformation about what Al Assad is supposed to have done and is supposed to be doing.I do not believe for one minute that Al Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people- rather I believe that it is the rebels, armed by the western powers, the Turks and the Saudis, that are doing so to those that are supporting Al Assad. For once the world must not be fooled with lies and they must stand up against the traditional bullies of the world, those that believe in regime change and those that destabilise and destroy the nations of others for economic and pecuniary gain.I do not blame Al Assad for the 90,000 people that have been killed in Syria since this conflict began but instead I blame the western powers, their allies and the Syrian rebels who are actually arming encouraging and funding Al Qaeda islamist fighters to lead the fight in the battle against Al Assad. How Barak Obama can stomach the stench of those that slit the throats of so-called \u201dunbelivers\u201d and commit these atrocities and actually fund and support them I don\u2019t know.Yesterday it was Iraq, Egypt and Libya. Today it is Syria. Tomorrow it will be Lebanon and Iran. After they have finished with the Middle East they will take the battle to the gates of Russia and China. And of course one day it will be the Sudan, Nigeria and Somalia. Their lust for power and determination to control the entire world is insatiable and it has no end. It is time for people to wake up and stop being taken in by their evil lies and disinformation which is being churned out on a daily basis by the international news networks which they control. It is time for the world to wake up and say \u201cenough is enough\u201d. It is time for the truth to prevail.Oh Lord Jesus return soon and save this world from the evil of those that seek to rule it and wipe out your counsel in the name of the devil. These people are the natural enemies of all believers whether they be christian, jewish or muslim. They do not believe in God. They believe in the power of the devil, the gods of the New Age, the usage of money, brute force, murder, disinformation, lies and deceit. They are the agents of the Illuminati who seek to establish a one world government and a new world order where no monotheic religion and no faith has any relevance and where the Living God is relegated to the background and is described as a powerless relic of history.It is the duty of every believer, whether christian, muslim or jewish, to resist their evil and their desire to control and dominate the world and its resources. May God open the eyes of the people of the world to their evil and to their sheer callousness and greed. Satan works through them and he seeks to enslave us all by empowering and enthroning them. They have all the power, all the armies, all the money, all the media houses, all the international television networks, all the satellite and space-based spying systems and all the sophisticated telecommunication networks. They control virtually everything on the earth. Yet we have God, who never sleeps and who has never lost a battle.In the end His counsel alone will stand, His will shall be done, His purpose shall be established and His name will be glorified. Even if they kill half the world\u2019s population in their evil quest, at the end of the day the righteous shall be vindicated and the truth shall prevail because God is with us. I weep when I see the innocents that are slaughtered on a daily basis in Syria. I cry when I see children being beheaded and blown apart and when I see the bodies of women being mutilated. I groan when I see deranged and callous men doing the will of America and destroying their own beautiful country and heritage for no just cause. I shudder when I see so-called rebels hacking their compatriots to pieces and eating their hearts and organs with joy.Vladimir Putin\u2019s words to David Cameron during their joint press conference at 10 Downing Street after a meeting on 16th June are instructive. He said \u201dI think you will not deny that one does not really need to support the people who not only kill their enemies, but open up their bodies, eat their intestines, in front of the public and cameras. Is it them you want to supply with weapons?\u201d. These are wise words indeed and a legitimate question. We should all take a little time out to ponder on them. Another interesting contribution came from the respected American war hero General Wesley Clark who was the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe during the Kosovo war. He said that America had drawn up plans to invade Iraq, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Iran as far back as 2001 just a few days after the attack on the Twin Towers in New York on 9/11. It follows that what we are witnessing in Syria today is a script that was written many years ago and which is being effected with ruthless determination and clinical precision. No matter how long it takes and regardless of the cost in terms of loss of civilian lives and the shedding of innocent blood those that believe that it is their manifest duty and destiny to rule and dominate the entire world are determined to effect their sinister purpose and evil agenda and bring Syria down to her knees. This, surely, is not only a travesty of justice but it also a tragedy of monuemental proportions.Yet the American-made Shakespearean tragedies of the Middle East just keep on unfolding. Let us go back a little. According to George Galloway, the utterly irrepressable, exceptionally intelligent and deeply courageous British Member of Parliament for Bradford, no less than one million Iraqi people, mainly women and children, died as a direct consequence of the economic sanctions and the \u201doil for food\u201d programme that the west imposed on Iraq when Saddam Hussein was still in power. Yet it didn\u2019t stop there. When Iraq was eventually invaded and Baghdad was carpet-bombed by George W. Bush\u2019s and Tony Blair\u2019s \u201dcoalition of the willing\u201d in 2003 no less than 150,000 Iraqi civilians, again mainly women and children, were slaughtered like flies within the space of just a few days. What a terrible price that had to be paid for the sheer mess that we have in Iraq today where the minority sunni muslims are waging an all out jihad against the majority shia. That is the kind of carnage, confusion and mayhem that America and her allies are spreading all over the Middle East and it appears that Syria is in the process of being consummed by it and of sparking off a major regional conflict which is drawing in many other countries. This beleagured nation has been turned into a blood-soaked arena and a blood-drenched theater for a proxy war which is bound to spread to the neighbouring Arab countries. What an utter shame.Yet like David Icke, Naom Chomsky, Alex Jones, Norman G. Finkelstein, George Galloway and millions of other deep thinkers and great minds from all over the world I stand with the Syrian people and the legitimate government of their sovereign and independant state at this difficult time. I believe that no matter what the agents of satan say or do God shall defend their noble cause and He shall vindicate them and deliver them from the evil that stalks the world and that seeks to take control of their land.Permit me to end this contribution with some interesting questions that were put by Yele Odofin Bello, who is a Nigerian Canadian and who has captured the mood of the moment rather well. He wrote, \u201dwhy would the west arm rebels in Syria against a recognised government whilst they did the exact opposite in Colombia and Sri Lanka? Who decides what is evil and what is not? And what yardstick do we use to make these determinations? Why should Iran stay on the sideline when the Saudis and other despotic Arab regimes support rebels in this conflict? I still maintain that objective journalism died in 2007. The BBC, CNN and other western media houses continue to claim that Al Assad has \u2018killed over 92,000 of his own people\u2019. Does it mean that all those casualties were rebels and civilians? Why is the western press so eager to marginalise the Syrian Army by referring to them as \u2018regime forces\u2019 or \u2018Assad forces\u2019?\u201d The answers to these pertinent and insightful questions are self-evident.Thankfully there are a number of inflluential voices in the west and particularly in the United Kingdom that are also of the view that arming the Syrian rebels would be a fatal mistake. Boris Johnson, the flamboyant Mayor of London, is one of those voices. He said \u201darming the Syrian rebels would be disasterous because Britain would be pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs\u201d. He also warned David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, that he \u201dshould not use Syria as an arena for muscle-flexing\u201d and that \u201dany weapons sent to the rebels could end up in the hands of Al Qaeda\u201d. This is wise counsel from a deeply concerned Tory party colleague and the Prime Minister would do well to accept it. Other British leaders that have voiced their opposition and expressed deep concerns about supplying arms to the rebels include Dr. John Sentamu (the Archbishop of York), Lord Dannat (the former head of the British Armed Forces), Julian Lewis (a leading backbench Tory MP) and Nick Clegg (the Deputy Prime Minister). Let us hope that these saner voices prevail in what is turning out to be a deeply disturbing narrative.God bless the people of the Syrian Arab Republic.Copyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Nigerians are unwittingly pushing towards another civil war \u2013 Gov.

The resources, human and material, used to prosecute wars could have been used for the development of the people. The lesson of history is that nations and people emerged from wars weakened, devastated, poor and vulnerable.\u201cThe worst part is that though a nation\u2019s decision to go to war or not may be easy before the outbreak of hostilities, it is more difficult and sometimes impossible to decide to stop a war; thus we have prolonged and sometimes an indeterminate war. This is the hard part.\u201cWe see the devastations of war in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon (and closer home) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. While some like Liberia and Sierra Leone are fortunate to put the war behind them, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq have found it difficult to stop their own wars.\u201dThe governor, however, urged Nigerian youths to apply their education in solving problems facing humanity.\u2018Don\u2019t kill the best state university in Nigeria\u2019 \u2013 ASUU tells Govs. Ajimobi, AregbesolaLAUTECH: Why Govs. Ajimobi, Aregbesola must resign \u2013 ASUUWhat we did to Biafran soldiers during the civil war \u2013 Gen OnojaLai Mohammed reveals what will lead to another civil war in NigeriaPay us to save future of 30,000 LAUTECH students \u2013 Workers tell Ajimobi, AregbesolaBode George warns Buhari against another civil war, tells Saraki, Dogara what to doCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Femi Fani-Kayode: As the carnage begins", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb Opinion \u00bb Femi Fani-Kayode: As the carnage beginsPublishedonByI am proud of the decision that the British Parliament has taken not to join in the attack on Syria. Prime Minister David Cameron has been badly humiliated and this is a great triumph for Ed Milliband, the Leader of the Opposition. Kudos to my friend Mr. George Galloway MP for his brilliant and stirring speech on the floor of the House of Commons on this issue. I must confess that the only speech that has moved me as much as Galloway\u2019s in recent times was the riveting and spell-binding speech delivered by the Irish MP, Mrs.Clare Daly, on the floor of the Irish Parliament where she described President Barack Obama as a \u201dwar criminal\u201d and a \u201dmurderer of children\u201d. People like Galloway and Daly are amongst those that I would describe as today\u2019s \u201dservants of truth\u201d and history and posterity will be very kind to them regardless of the contempt, anger, insults and ridicule that they have been subjected to by the retrograde forces of conservatism that presently control the world.The resolution of the British Parliament not to go to war in Syria gives us hope that sanity may eventually prevail in a world that has proved to be increasingly insane. Yet sadly it appears that France and America are as eager to go as ever. As the assault on Syria is about to start and the carnage is about to begin please take note of the following words- the biggest mistake that President Barack Obama will make in his distinguished political career and in his Presidency is to strike Syria on the false and contrived premise that President Bashir Al Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people.What we are witnessing today is the laying of the foundation and the planting of the seeds for what will eventually be World War 3. I am not suggesting that the military strike on Syria will witness the beginning of World War 3. What I am saying is that it will lay the foundation for it. I believe that the war itself will come at a much later stage and probably long after both Obama and Russia\u2019s President Vladimer Putin have both left office. However the military action that America is about to embark on in Syria will be the first step on the road to that terrible final conflict. After they have struck Syria nothing will be the same again and we shall finally be on that long-awaited conflict-ridden slippery slope to Armageddon. And after that war has been fought and won historians will have cause to say that the brutal, unjustifiable, indefensible and illegal attack by Obama\u2019s America and her allies on Syria is where and when the die was finally cast. They will say that that is when the Americans finally crossed the line of no return, of no fear and of no shame. They will say that that is when the Americans should have been stopped.Nothing describes the frightful situation that we are faced with today in the Middle East better than the words of Mr. Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, when he said, just a few days ago, that \u201dthe west handles the muslim world like a monkey handles a grenade\u201d. The events and bloody carnage that we are about to witness being unleashed by America and her allies on Syria, a relatively small country of 22 million people, will be so brazen, so vicious, so chilling and so ruthless that for the first time in world history Russia, Iran and China will come together, finally pick up the gauntlet and muster the courage to say \u201dno more\u201d to American lawlessness, manipulation, deceit, double standards and butchery. At that point there will be no going back and, slowly but surely, one thing will lead to another in the Middle East and the conflict will spread until the final conflagration comes. The truth is that just as Shakespeare wrote in his famous play \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d over 400 years ago, in the world today \u201cCaeser has crossed the Rubicorn, war is inevitable\u201d.Yet many have bought into and wholeheartedly accepted the American propaganda that Al Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people. It is in the same way that they bought into the propaganda that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons that he was about to use against his own people and the rest of the world. They bought into that propaganda just as they bought into the propaganda that 911 was carried out by Osama Bin Ladin, just as they bought into the propaganda that Muammar Ghaddafi was a monster that was about to kill all his people, just as they bought into the propaganda that Obama was the Messiah who wanted to spread democracy in the Middle East, just as they bought into the propaganda that Hosni Mubarak had to be removed to bring stability to Egypt, just as they bought into the propaganda that Tunisia would be better off with an islamist President, just as they bought into the propaganda that Iran is evil, just as they bought into the propaganda that the Saudis are angels, just as they bought into the propaganda that Israel can do no wrong, just as they bought into the propaganda that there was no coup in Egypt, just as they bought into the propaganda that Hamas must not be recognised, just as they bought into the propaganda that Hezbollah are terrorists and just as they bought into the propaganda that Lebanon did not deserve to be stable and must be nothing more than a weak and crisis-ridden buffer-state which exists at their pleasure.I suggest that those that have bought into all this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical propaganda take the time out to listen to what the distinguished and respected American General Wesley Clark (the man who had the distinct privilage and honour of leading the NATO forces in Europe during the attack on Slobodan Milosovitch\u2019s forces in Serbia and Belgrade in the 90\u2019s) said in 2007 about America\u2019s intentions in the Middle East and about how those plans had been hatched as far back as 2001. He claimed that just two weeks after 911 America had taken the decision to remove the leaders of no less than 7 Middle Eastern countries by any means necessary in order to fully secure of the Middle East. He actually listed those countries, Today, and for the last 5 years, we are bearing witness to everything that he said would happen and those things are unfolding before our very eyes. It is only the dull, the shallow and the naive that can possibly deny this. Clarks\u2019s tape can be found on youtube for those that doubt what I have said.Finally let me make two two points. Firstly there is absolutely NO evidence to suggest that it was Al Asssad\u2019s forces that actually used the chemical weapons that were unleashed on the civilian population in Syria the other day and it could well have been the rebels that did it. The fact that Assad\u2019s troops were also affected by those weapons tells me a lot. No sane leader poisons his own soldiers with sarin gas. And he certainly does not do so on his own doorstep, on the day that international weapons inspectors arrive in his country and in the middle of a war which he is on the verge of winning. Secondly the fact that America and her allies have decided not to go through the U.N. Security Council on this matter makes whatever action they take against Al Assad and Syria manifestly illegal. It violates every rule of international law and it creates yet another bad precedent.The resolve by America not to go through the UN Security Council before doing anything creates the greatest problem of all. Who appointed America as the policeman of the world and who annointed her as the spokesman for the international community? The Security Council was established to stop and prevent precisely the type of cruel, illegal and arbitary use of power that the American government is about to indulge in and unleash on Syria. No country should be allowed to play God and when they choose to do so they must be told clearly and categorically that they are operating outside the law. The truth is that America has gone beserk and the power it wields today has caused many that are in positions of authority over there to be reckless, arrogant and delusional. There is an evil agenda that is unfolding before our very eyes which many people that are not discerning, bright or knowledgeable enough can possibly recognise or appreciate. Many have argued that the rebels could not have launched the chemical attack because they did not have the heavy weapons, the know-how or the capabilities to do so. This is hogwash. The Syrian rebels can do anything and muster or use any kind of heavy weapons as long as their American, French, Saudi and Turkish friends are ready to help them. That is the bitter and ugly truth.The fact that the rebels are led by brutal cannibals and Al Qaeda islamists and that the American government is in an unholy alliance with such beasts tells me everything that I need to know. The American government is ready to get into bed with even the devil and do just about anything to get rid of or discredit Al Assad, including turning a blind eye to the use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians by those rebels and then blaming it on the Assad regime. I for one do not believe for one minute that Al Assad used chemicals weapons. The fact that the Syrian rebels are killing christians and secularist muslims in droves and that they wish to establish an islamic fundamentalist state on the borders of Israel also tells me that those that support such people are misguided individuals that do not care for muslims, christians or jews. The Americans are effecting the agenda of satan, pure and simple. They should go ahead and use their power. We know that nothing and no-one will stop them. They should satisfy their blood-lust and kill as many people as they like in Syria. They should remove as many governments and conquer as many nations as they choose in the Middle East and elsewhere. They should take as much oil as they like. They should do as they please and establish their \u201dnew world order\u201d. One day God will rise up and avenge the weaker nations of the world whom they have manipulated, discredited, cheated and destroyed. They should revel in the moment and enjoy the killings and carnage that they are about to unleash. However the one thing that they shall not do is to compel those of us that are discerning enough to see through their lies, their greed and their wickedness to clap for them and sit back silently as they slaughter the world and impose their values. All we can do is create awareness about their evil agenda to those that care to listen. And we shall continue to do so whether they like it or not.One day the good people of American themselves will understand that they have been deceived by their own governments. American governments and American Presidents are simply puppets and middle-ranking representatives of a much greater force that seeks to destroy mankind and control the entire world. All you need to do is to be a student of eschatology to appreciate this. The assumptions that many have made about what is true and what is not true in Syria and elsewhere are simply wrong. Yes chemical weapons were used and many people, including innocent women and children, were killed but the question is who by, who gave the order and what was the motive and purpose for such a heartless act? In the May 6th edition of the Washington Times newspaper it was reported that Mrs.Carla Del Ponte, the former International Court For Criminal Justice prosecutor and a respected member of the United Nations Independant International Commission Of Inquiry On Syria told Swiss TV that \u201dthere were strong concrete suspicions that Syrian rebels that were seeking to oust Al Assad had used the nerve agent sarin\u201d. This honest Canadian lady certainly seems to know what is really going on but who is listening to her? One day the American people will open their eyes to the evil and manifest injustice that their governments, particularly Obama\u2019s government, have inflicted on the people of the Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan and north Africa. Until then we shall sit back and watch American forces kill perhaps as many Syrians as they did in the first few days of the bombing of Baghdad when they snuffed out 150,0000 innocent Iraqi souls, including women and children. I hope that they can sleep well at night when this happens. The blood of those innocent souls is as much on the hands of those hapless cheerleaders that believe everything that they are told by the international television networks and that defend or seek to justify this abominable action as it is on those who actually ordered and executed it.Permit me to end this essay with an interesting contribution from a deeply courageous and insightful englishman by the name of Mr. David Icke. He said-\u201dthese genetic liars are so desperate to bomb the Assad regime into history. This is because the global plan to subvert and conquer the Middle and Near East has had its timetable scuppered by the Syrian Government\u2019s refusal to fall in the wake of a civil war. That civil war was orchestrated through psychopathic mercenaries by the hidden forces behind NATO. Those forces are now planning to bomb Syria via their political puppets who dare not refuse to take orders \u2013 not that this lot need much encouragement. They are planning to kill and maim even more people with brown faces on their way to controlling the whole of the vast region known as Eurasia. The plan was for them to have invaded Lebanon and Iran by now so they are seeking to bomb away the blockage and stalemate in Syria where the NATO armed-and-funded \u2018rebels\u2019 have been losing ground to the Assad military. To do so, they are claiming with no evidence, that Assad ordered a chemical attack on his own people. They have tried this before without success when it became clear that the alleged \u2018Assad\u2019 chemical attacks were instigated by the very \u2018rebels\u2019 that NATO controls to manufacture an excuse for NATO to invade. Now, in pathetic desperation, they are doing the same thing again and this time refusing to take no for an answer or produce any credible evidence (they can\u2019t) because their masters\u2019 timetable demands that Assad be removed now \u2013 just as it did with Gaddafi in Libya. And the global corporate media is playing its usual part in repeating the lies as fact. By doing so the blood will be on their hands as well, just as it has always been throughout corporate media history. They are so stupid, so uninformed, so moronic, that they can\u2019t see that they and their families are going to be subjected to the same Orwellian fascist society that they are providing the daily propaganda to justify\u201d.These are powerful and instructive words from Icke. As Sir Winston Churchill once said \u201dthe truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is\u201d. May God bless and protect the good people Syria.Copyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Report reveals there will be more hunger, extremism in 2018", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb News \u00bb Report reveals there will be more hunger, extremism in 2018PublishedonByHumanitarian crises around the world will worsen in 2018, with no let-up in civil wars in Africa, near-famines in war-torn regions and the threat of extremist Islamist violence.A Geneva-based think-tank, ACAPS, made the prediction in a report published on Thursday.ACAPS, a non-profit venture that supports humanitarian aid workers with daily monitoring and analysis of 150 countries, examined the anticipated needs of 18 countries in 2018 and found little to cheer.\u201cIf 2017 did not look good, predictions for 2018 are no better: violence and insecurity are likely to deteriorate in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya, Ethiopia, Mali, Somalia, and Syria in 2018,\u201d ACAPS director Lars Nissen wrote in the report.In 2018, Ethiopia will join northeast Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen as places at risk of famine, said the report, entitled \u201cHumanitarian Overview: An analysis of key crises into 2018\u201d.Rather than bringing stability, the prospect of elections in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, South Sudan and Venezuela is expected to exacerbate tensions and fuel violence.Islamic extremism will also continue to cause death and conflict, the report said.Inspite of the defeat of Islamic State in its main strongholds in Iraq, the group is expected to continue improvised attacks throughout the country to destabilise the government, as well as gaining strength and resources in southern Libya.Islamic State is also likely to increase its small position in the Puntland region of Somalia, impacting the civilian population and clashing with its bigger regional rival Al-Shabaab, which will increase the lethality of its own attacks.Islamist armed groups are also expected to take advantage of the withdrawal of government troops from central Mali, gaining local recruits and further influence, while in Afghanistan the Taliban will consolidate their rural strongholds and increased opium production will boost funding for armed groups.ACAPS said the fragmentation of armed groups in Central African Republic is expected to worsen the violence there, sending more refugees into Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo.\u201cMilitia groups previously focused on local grievances will likely become increasingly frustrated by the national, political, and socioeconomic situation and are likely to increase violence, particularly against government forces and institutions,\u201d ACAPS said.(Reuters/NAN)Copyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Femi Fani-Kayode: The Trojan Horse and the Prince of Persia", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb Opinion \u00bb Femi Fani-Kayode: The Trojan Horse and the Prince of PersiaPublishedonBy\u201dIsrael will no longer exist in 25 years\u201d- Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei , the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran.The Prince of Persia is a spirit being that the Holy Bible describes as a \u201dprincipality\u2019\u2019. He rules over the geographical space that was once known as Persia but that is now known as Iran.This is an entity that has the power to contend with even the most awesome of God\u2019s angels. Judging from the words of Ayatollah Khamenei I have little doubt that he is firmly under the grip of this spirit being.When he speaks, it is not him that is speaking but rather it is the Prince of Persia that is speaking through him. This contribution is about the folly of trusting such a man and the manifest danger of entering into a nuclear arms deal with him.Permit me to begin with an aside. One of the consequences of the war in Syria and Iraq is the massive inflow of refugees from the Middle East into Europe. It is sad to see millions of people fleeing their homeland and walking half way across the world to escape the savagery of war.The question that arises is this: why have Saudi Arabia and the other Arab Gulf states refused to assist their Muslim and Arab brothers and take them in? Mr. Paul Joseph Watson raised some pertinent points in a contribution to Global Research. He wrote:\u2018\u2019While European countries are being lectured about their failure to take in enough refugees, Saudi Arabia \u2013 which has taken in precisely zero migrants has 100,000 air conditioned tents that can house over 3 million people sitting empty. The sprawling network of high quality tents are located in the city of Mina, spreading across a 20 square km valley, and are only used for 5 days of the year by Hajj pilgrims. The tents could provide shelter for almost all of the 4 million Syrian refugees that have been displaced by the country\u2019s civil war. While it refuses to take in any more refugees, Saudi Arabia has offered to build 200 mosques for the 500,000 migrants a year expected to pour into Germany. While Europe is being burdened by potentially millions of people who don\u2019t share the same culture or religion as the host population, Gulf Arab states refuse to pull their weight, resolving only to throw money at the problem\u201d.Mr. Watsons\u2019 observations are legitimate.I support the assertion that the west should take in as many Arab refugees as possible on humanitarian grounds. However there must be a moment of pause whilst we consider the following questions.Is it possible that some of those that have fled to Europe are actually ISIS members who are using this opportunity to plant themselves in the very heart of western civilization where they can wreak havoc? Is there any truth in the Russian narrative that the massive exodus of Arab refugees into Europe today is nothing short of a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d invasion?Again is it conceivable that the refusal of the Saudis to receive any of the refugees is borne out of the fact that the quickest way to change the racial and religious identity of Europe and to bring greater Arab and Islamic influence to bear on western culture and civilization is the mass migration of millions of Muslim refugees into Europe?This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that instead of taking in the refugees the Saudi authorities have instead offered to build 200 mosques in Germany in order to cater for the migrants that seek refuge there.Do those voices in Europe that have called for caution in receiving the refugees have a point? That remains to be seen. This brings us to the very heart of this contribution and begs for an answer to the following question.If such an influx of refugees into Europe has been triggered off by what is essentially a Middle Eastern proxy war between the U.S.A and Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Russia and Iran on the other, can one possibly imagine the sheer carnage and massive influx that a war between Iran and Israel would cause?What is happening today would be child\u2019s play when one considers that scenario. Yet those that support the Iran nuclear arms deal fail to appreciate the fact that strengthening Iran by lifting sanctions and putting hundreds of billions of dollars in the Iranian governments\u2019 coffers takes us one step closer to such a conflict.Until Iran renounces its intention of spreading global jihad and until the clerics that rule that country stop their provocative rhetoric towards Israel there can never be peace.The only language that terror understands is an equal dose of terror. The policy of appeasement which the Iran nuclear deal represents is the worst thing that could have happened and those that have put it in place will have cause to deeply regret it.The greatest mistake that President Obama has made is to trust Iran. This is a country whose leaders have continuously referred to America as the \u2018\u2019great Satan\u2019\u2019 and Israel as the \u2018\u2019little Satan\u2019\u2019.This is a country whose Supreme Leader opens political rallies by chanting \u2018\u2019death to America\u2019\u2019. This is a country whose former President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that Israel would be \u2018\u2019wiped off the face of the earth\u2019\u2019.This is a country whose leaders believe in the coming of the great Muslim \u201dMahdi\u201d- the so-called \u201cGuided One\u201d whose coming, according to shia eschatology and prophecy, \u201cwill be heralded by the raising of a black flag in Kurasan\u201d. This is a country whose leaders fully espouse the concept of global jihad and whose constitution specifically calls for the destruction of America and Israel.By this deal President Obama has given the Iranian government immense power and a new lease of life. This is a government that is perverse in all its ways and that presides over the affairs of a vicious and unrelenting theocratic state. This is a government that is led by a handful of misguided religious fanatics whose objective is to spread radical Islam throughout the world.This is a government that has taken away the basic freedoms of its\u2019 own people and held them in bondage for the last 36 years. This is a government that exports blood, death and terror by funding terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Mehdi Army and many others throughout the world.Given all this can anyone legitimately dispute the words of the former Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr. Avigdor Lieberman, who described the nuclear deal as \u201da surrender to terror\u201d? On his part the Defence Minister of Israel, Mr. Moshe Yaalon, said it is a deal that was built on Iran\u2019s \u201dlies and deceit\u201d. He went further by describing the agreement as \u201da tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and who fear a nuclear Iran\u201d.Most instructive of all was the contribution of Israel\u2019s Education Minister, Mr. Naftali Bennet, who warned that: \u201dThe history books have been re-written again today and this period will be deemed particularly grave and dangerous\u201d. He said, \u201dwestern citizens who get up for another day at work or school are not aware of the fact that about half a trillion dollars has been transferred to the hands of a terrorist superpower, the most dangerous country in the world, who has promised the destruction of nations and peoples. Today it may be us, tomorrow it may reach every country in the form of suitcase bombs in London or New York. Israel has done everything possible to warn of danger and in the end it will follow its own interest and will do whatever it takes to defend itself\u201d (See Peter Beaumonts\u2019 article in the UK\u2019s, Guardian Newspaper, 14th July 2015).These men have spoken nothing but the truth and the world would do well to listen. Sadly that does not appear to be happening because the American government has been sold a dummy and they have taken the full plunge. I have always viewed Obama\u2019s policies in the Middle East and North Africa with suspicion.In my view he is the greatest friend that the radical jihadists have ever had in the White House and he has done more for their cause than any other American President. His support for the Iran nuclear deal confirms this.Permit me to conclude this contribution with a word to Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the man who said that Israel will \u201dno longer exist\u2019\u2019 in 25 years: hell will freeze over before Israel ever goes down.Mr. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, responded to him in an equally eloquent manner by saying, \u201canyone who attacks Israel will pay with his life\u201d.A word is enough for the wise. The day that Iran attacks Israel will be the day that Iran would have signed its own death warrant. They will be crushed beyond recognition and redemption.Femi Fani-Kayode: The coward called Godswill AkpabioFemi Fani-Kayode: A few good menFemi Fani-Kayode: Biafra, Buhari and his \u2018soft\u2019 Civil WarFemi Fani-Kayode: The sons of Satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 2]Femi Fani-Kayode: The sons of satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 1]Femi Fani-Kayode: When the bully met the headmaster at the White HouseCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Adesoji Adesugba: Nigeria: Reasons we should stop the drumbeats of war", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb Opinion \u00bb Adesoji Adesugba: Nigeria: Reasons we should stop the drumbeats of warPublishedonBy1966 is playing itself out again in Nigeria. Today, I can hear the sound of the drums like I did then. The noise of the call to war. I was not too young in the late sixties to know about the civil war in my country. Of course, I vividly recall an enemy plane bombing Lagos during the war. I was out playing soccer with my friends when the bombs hit somewhere in the Yaba area of Lagos. I recall how we all scampered to our various homes. Though living in Lagos, far away we thought from the scene of war, the consequences of such situations were visible to us, kids, as we were, when refugees from the front lines, arrived the city in droves in different sad conditions with their tales of woes.For those who do not know or pretend not to know the effects of war, they need not go far to see today\u2019s devastation of Northeastern Nigeria from the Boko Haram insurgency. If they are not satisfied, they can check footages of the wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Rwanda, Afghanistan and Syria on YouTube. The scenario is horrible. Life will become different as we know it. Humanity will become less than animals. We will descend to the abyss of hell without actually dying. People shall wish for death in the midst of death, and pain, blood, and grief shall be everyday companions of those in a land that once knew peace. Then the value of peace shall dawn on the actors, but it will be difficult to find.Let us note that all our friends and brothers in Nigeria who have nothing to do with this awful propaganda will be made to go Eastwards where they have no bearings or ties. Mind you, since the Southeast of Nigeria is landlocked those who seek the State of Biafra will continue to insist on including parts of the South-South of Nigeria, and of course we should expect disagreements. Conflicts and disagreements such as this are what starts wars. Those who will suffer most are children, women and old people. Of course, expect the maiming and killing of many youths in their prime as they will be the ones to do the battle. Do not forget the millions of people (mostly the young) who were killed by both sides during the Nigerian Civil war in the sixties.For all those who are keeping quiet now, know that you will not have the chance to speak as you would now once the war starts. We all have the opportunity to speak out for peace now. Now is the time to blow the ember of a peaceful coexistence and not war. Now is the time to form groups for peace. Now is the time to use your social media platforms to preach the gospel of peace to your followers. I am yet to see groups like Igboland Against War (IAW), Yorubas Against War (YAW), Hausa Against War (HAW), Igbos love Nigeria (ILN), Yorubas for an Equitable Nigeria (YEN), Hausas for One Nigeria (HON), dominate the social discussion.Let us avoid the carnage that may take the lives of millions of Nigeria, talk is cheaper than war, and it is the only option that will eventually settle our differences. In war, all sides will lose and eventually there will always be devastation, more hatred, unfulfilled dreams, suspicion, loss of lives and properties, economic and political collapse. Even the little we have now won\u2019t be there, food will be scarce, families will be separated, our daughters will be forced by the war into prostitution, our children will be conscripted to fight a war they do not understand, death shall be our daily companion, and human life will become worthless.As for those who would have caused the carnage, the high and mighty, the wealthy political elite, they will run away abroad and leave the poor and middle class to bear the brunt. Countries will shut their borders, and many will be trapped in the hellhole that Nigeria will become.We can yet avoid this seemingly impending Hiroshima. Let the political elites from all the warring ethnic groups this time around, and sincerely too, sit down and work out the modalities for equity, justice, and peaceful coexistence, as we all stand to gain as a united Nigeria. Let all our brothers, sisters, wives and husbands stand up to speak for unity, peace, equity, and justice. There are more Igbo outside Igboland than inside. Yorubas, Hausas, Ibibios, Ogoris, Idomas and indeed all Nigerians stand to lose everything and gain nothing from this act that is playing out. Everyone will be affected by war, so, before it becomes irreversible let this death bearing vehicle stop and move no more.Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, an Economic Development Specialist and the Chairman of the Editorial Board of Sahel Standard writes from Abuja.2019: Why Saraki is the right presidential candidate for Nigeria \u2013 Baraje2019: What Chris Okotie said about defection by Nigerian politiciansUK ex-minister speaks on conflict in Nigeria\u2019s governmentFIFA releases Nigeria\u2019s latest ranking in world footballNorthern Nigeria most backward people in the world \u2013 Nuhu RibaduJonathan speaks on state of the nation, tells Nigerians what to doCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Femi Fani-Kayode: The quest for a new world caliphate", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb Opinion \u00bb Femi Fani-Kayode: The quest for a new world caliphatePublishedonByThe CIA have confirmed the fact that up to 30,000 soldiers are now fighting for ISIS, ISIL and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Given this sobering news it is a matter of tremendous relief and indeed joy that President Barack Obama has announced that it is the intention of the United States to \u2018\u2019degrade and destroy\u2019\u2019 ISIL by launching a series of deadly airstrikes and to play a more vigorous and active role in the fight against terror.Our very own President Goodluck Jonathan and the Nigerian Armed Forces have a lesson to learn from this new-found American initiative and resolve: it is time for us to take off the gloves and to despatch our own local equivalent of ISIS back to hell where they belong.It is time for us to recognize the fact that were are not just fighting against a group of barbaric, primitive and ignorant peasants, cave men and insurgents who lack compassion and human decency but rather that we are involved in a full scale civil war against a sophisticated, clever, determined, well-funded, well-motivated, well-armed and relentless enemy who have plenty of resources and local support from elements within the political class and who are hell-bent on killing our people, raping our women, abducting our children, dismembering our country and taking us back to the 6th century.Had it not been for the admirable efforts of Colonel Sambo Dasuki, who was appointed National Security Advisor after the demise of General Patrick Azazi a couple of years back, things would have been a lot worse and Abuja would have still been under siege today. Had it not been for the sheer dexterity and immense courage of our intelligence agencies and Armed Forces the towns of Bama, Konduga and a number of other communities in the north-east would still have been occupied by the Haramites today and Maiduguri itself, the capital of Borno State, may well have fallen by now.I have nothing but praise, gratitude and admiration for our uniformed men and women that are fighting at the warfront and I pray for them every day. Regardless of a few set backs here and there they really have done us proud. Yet things should never have got this bad in the first place and Boko Haram ought to never have been allowed to make the kind of inroads and impact that they have made in the last four years. Three years ago I warned about this threat and offered similar counsel in a series of essays about Boko Haram.I also criticised what I considered to be the Federal Government\u2019s inadequate response to the challenge at the time. Sadly, rather than listen, the majority of Nigerian politicians, newspaper columnists, government officials and professional commentators, as usual, condemned me roundly, said that I was an alarmist and complained that I was being far too harsh on the enemy and far too extreme in my counsel.One particular individual even accused me of being a \u2018\u2019bloodthirsty and callous maniac who had no value for human life\u2019\u2019. Clearly they misunderstood what Boko Haram stood for and they had no understanding of the nature of the beast that they were dealing with.Today, almost 20,000 cold-blooded murders and hundreds of abductions and kidnappings later, the very same people that condemned me and ostracised me three years ago for advocating that the Jonathan administration ought to \u201dtreat Boko Haram like a festering and putrid cancer\u201d, \u2018\u2019kill all the Haramites and their secret friends, allies and sponsors\u201d and that \u201dthey should blow up the towns that were loyal to them or that harbored them\u2019\u2019 are now commending my foresight.They are also burying their heads in shame and hiding under their beds whenever they hear the words \u2018\u2019Boko Haram\u2019\u2019. Worse still those of them that are southerners are urging their fellow southerners that live in the north to leave the north as quickly as possible and move back to the south as a consequence of the scourge, as if that would not play right into the hands of the terrorists.The truth is that the majority of Nigerians are notoriously shortsighted people who are not only undiscerning but who also always choose to believe the best about the villains and the worst about the good guys. Sadly this has played right into the hands and the horrific narrative of the beasts and terrorists that seek to decimate us and consequently for the last three years they have had a field day.Yet, if it is any consolation, this has been so throughout the world and not just in Nigeria. The Jonathan administration were not the only ones that were slow in their initial response to the challenge presented by the islamists and they were not the only ones that failed to fully comprehend and appreciate the fact that the terrorists needed to be utterly crushed right from the outset.The Obama administration and indeed the rest of the civilised world made the same mistake when confronted with similar terrorist organisations in north Africa, the Middle East and east Africa in the last three years. The result of that lack of foresight is the fact that today ISIS, ISIL and the Islamic State have now become a threat to the entire free world.In Africa groups like Boko Haram and Al Shabab have drawn immense inspiration and courage from the successes of ISIL and ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ISIL is the greatest threat to world peace today and they have committed more horrors and indulged in more violence than any other islamist terrorist organisation that has ever existed.They are providing moral support for Al Qaeda in the north African Maghreb, Al Shabab in East Africa, Boko Haram in west Africa, Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Chechnyan separatists in Russia, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Islamic Jihad in Algeria, Daesh in Lebanon, the Al Nusra Front in Syria and all the other vermin that is crawling out from under the woodwork in the name of violent Jihad and in an attempt to create a new world Caliphate.Thousands of Christians, moderate Muslims and people of other faiths have been slaughtered in cold blood and abducted, raped and sold into slavery by the Boko Haramites and their allies and associates in northern Nigeria, the Cameroons and Mali in the last 4 years alone.This is a global war and we must ALL stand together to create more awareness and to fight it. I put much of the blame for the mess we are in on the doorstep of President Obama. He has been weak and naive on this matter right from the start.He refused to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation up until early this year even though by the end of last year they had butchered well over 15,000 Nigerians. This is inexplicable and it is indefensible.Even worse was his covert support for the rebels in Syria which included ISIS, Al Nusra and all the other islamist terrorists that were, and still are, fighting the government of President Bashar Al Assad. This policy was not only short-sighted and counterproductive but it was also nothing short of reprehensible.Ditto the support that some of America\u2019s closest allies in the region including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and all the other countries in the Middle East that funded the so-called rebels that were fighting Al Assad. Thankfully those rebels have not succeeded up until today.If they had done so we would have had an ISIL/Al Nusra government in power in Damascus today and I cannot imagine what could possibly be worse than that for peace in the Middle East and for peace with Israel.On that score I say thank God for the Russians, Hezbollah (yes Hezbollah) and Iran who saw that the greater evil was ISIL and Al Nusra and who supported Al Assad and stood with him against them. America and her allies have to sit up, do some real soul-searching and endeavor to stop creating the unholy mess that the the rest of the world has to later assist in cleaning up.Let us face it, getting rid of men like Muammar Ghadaffi, Saddam Hussein and Hosni Mubarak was a big mistake. The Arab spring has turned into a never-ending and horrific nightmare and that nightmare appears to want to consume the entire world in fratricidal butchery and never-ending carnage.Yes those men were ruthless and brutal dictators but at least they were secularists who knew how to deal with islamist terror and Al Qaeda and at least they kept the peace in their respective countries and regions.No they were not democrats but neither are the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan or any other ally of America in the Middle East except for Israel.What is going on today in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Egypt today as a direct consequence of the choices that America made and the implementation of American foreign policy in those countries over the last ten to fifteen years is simply perverse and barbaric.It is a tragedy of monumental proportions and it really does have implications for the entire free world and particularly for the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Israel. One thing is clear: whether we like to admit it or not the violent terrorists with their barbaric vision of a new islamist world order are here to stay.We either do nothing, accept it and prepare for the worst or we fight it with all that we have got. I would prefer that we do the latter. Given the new-found resolve of the Americans in their struggle against ISIL and given the recent gains that the Nigerian Armed Forces have made in the war with Boko Haram it is clear that we are now moving in the right direction. May God deliver us and may He grant us the victory in this noble quest.Femi Fani-Kayode: The coward called Godswill AkpabioFemi Fani-Kayode: A few good menFemi Fani-Kayode: Biafra, Buhari and his \u2018soft\u2019 Civil WarFemi Fani-Kayode: The sons of Satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 2]Femi Fani-Kayode: The sons of satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 1]Femi Fani-Kayode: When the bully met the headmaster at the White HouseCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Femi Fani-Kayode: Syria \u2013 Putin\u2019s bombs and a call to arms", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb Opinion \u00bb Femi Fani-Kayode: Syria \u2013 Putin\u2019s bombs and a call to armsPublishedonByThe sound and sight of Russian cruise missiles and smart bombs dropping on thousands of ISIL fighters in Syria is a thing of joy. It is like music to my ears. At last someone has cultivated the courage to stop the pampering and to desist from trying to rationalize the evil of ISIS and the forces of terror. I have no doubt that President Vladimir Putin is being used by God to deliver the world from the greatest evil that we have witnessed since Hitler\u2019s fascism. The Russians are doing a great work in Syria.They confronted and crushed the evil of terrorism in Chechnya and now they are doing it in the Middle East. Mr. Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi and his ISIL fighters deserve no mercy. They deserve even worse than they are getting. We must encourage the Russians to keep the bombs flying and to send the demons to hell where they belong.This ought to be a lesson to the world and to President Obama. You don\u2019t encourage and tolerate evil on the altar of political expediency and neither should you support or covertly fund terrorists. More importantly whether the west wishes to accept it or not there is a new kid on the block who refuses to take prisoners and who understands the importance of wiping out the dark forces and bringing in the light.Those that believe that terrorists should be treated lightly, should be granted amnesty, should be negotiated with or should be used for a greater purpose have failed to grasp the importance of the following counsel: when the rubbish begins to stink you must throw it out. When slaves begin to overestimate their own importance and relevance you must cut off their balls.When dogs seek to rule in the land of men you must shoot them in the head. When a chicken starts to believe that it is an eagle you must cut off its beak. When the witch begins to afflict humanity you must burn her at the stake. When demons begin to call themselves angels you must send them back to hell.When psychopaths and sociopaths rule the land you must kill them all and ensure that there is no trace of their existence. Clearly Putin has imbued this philosophy and this set of principles very well. And it serves our collective purpose. Four years ago I advocated the Putin approach to confronting Boko Haram in Nigeria. In a series of essays I argued that we must wipe them out and if necessary blow up the communities and towns that covertly give them support.I made the case that they were nothing but pure evil and that they represented something so reprehensible and beastly that it was far beyond the understanding or imagination of the average Nigerian. I told the Nigerian people that if it required the systematic slaughter of entire populations to remove the cancer of jihadist terror then we must cultivate the courage to get on with the job and do it.I argued that President Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern-day Turkey, killed over one million fundamentalists and terrorists in his quest to establish a modern-day Muslim secular state and that it worked. I told the world that as long as Saudi Arabia continued to propagate and covertly fund the Wahhabi philosophy and the Salifist movement that the world would not know peace and that neither would we be free of terror.More importantly I warned the world about the danger of trusting President Barack Obama and how his covert policy of supporting terror groups like the Al Nusra Front in Syria against a secularist Syrian government would lead to disaster. As usual all my counsel fell on deaf ears and I received nothing but insults from the majority of our people who labeled me as hater of Muslims and who couldn\u2019t see beyond their noses.They were unable to make a distinction between a true Muslim and a radical jihadist who believes in the use of terror and violence. The result of their lack of understanding and foresight is what we have today both in Syria and Nigeria. Abuja is being bombed again and once again our soldiers are being slaughtered on the war front. Ever since the present administration has come to power the gains that were made by the previous administration against Boko Haram have been lost.Worst still the terrorist group have managed to mount a major counter-offensive against our cities in the north-east and to slaughter thousands in our civilian population. Just a few days ago no less than five bombs went off in one day. There is no doubt in my mind that now more than ever we need to retrace our steps and look to Putin\u2019s Russia as our natural ally in our fight against terror. If we want to stamp out Boko Haram we must look to the Russian Federation.If we refuse to eat humble pie and get the help that we need then we must prepare for greater casualties and more losses in our fight against terror. This is all the more so given the fact that Boko Haram has now joined ranks with ISIS.Permit me to end this contribution with a few words about the nature of the jihadists. They have an insatiable appetite for sadism and cruelty. They do not have the milk of human kindness in them and neither do such creatures react to gentle appeals. I say this because they are fundamentalists and zealots that are totally committed to destroying everything that we hold dear. Simply put they have gone beyond the realms of reason and rationality. If anyone doubts this they should find out about the horrific plight of the Yazidis\u2019 in Iraq and Syria whose women are treated as nothing but spoils of war by the ISIL fighters.These are ruthless and bloodthirsty men and they are committed to the destruction of the secular state, to the abrogation of our most basic civil liberties and human rights, to the waging of a global jihad and to the creation of a new Islamic caliphate where full sharia law is practiced and where Christianity and all other forms of religion, except for their own perverse understanding and interpretation of Islam, are banned. They also wish to change our way of life and impose their will on us through violent and barbaric means.People that are so debased and that have such little regard for human life and values are hardly likely to listen to appeals from anyone. You do not offer carrots to beasts. The only things they understand are bombs and the only language they appreciate is violence.A leading Pakistani politician made an interesting and relevant contribution on CNN last year when he spoke about the horrific stoning to death of a young lady outside the High Court in Islamabad simply because she married the man of her choice. He said, \u2019\u2019Pakistan is a country in which some people are fighting to keep us in the 21st century whilst others are fighting to take us back into the 8th century\u201d. This is the bitter truth and the same conflict is playing out in parts of the Middle East, north Africa, east Africa and Nigeria.It is time for us to come together and cleanse our land of these godless creatures. They should be cleansed from the land and eliminated in the same way that cockroaches and rats are cleansed and eliminated from a filthy house. This is because they are nothing but vermin and vampires from hell sent to our nation by Satan to torment and destroy us.They have slaughtered and raped our women and children, they have butchered and crucified our men, they have burnt our homes and bombed and desecrated our places of worship, they have slaughtered our religious leaders, they have taken over our communities and they have flown their evil black flag in parts of our nation.What more do they have to do to us before we cultivate the courage and the firm resolve to rise up and resist them? This is a call to arms. I call on every Nigerian to rise up, to fight the evil and to protect the integrity of our land and our people.I call on the military to be professional, thorough, brutal and ruthless, to show no mercy and to hold no quarter. I call on our people to have no dealings or interaction with ANYONE or any group of people that suggest that we should have dialogue with or that we should grant amnesty to Boko Haram.I call on them to view such people with the utmost suspicion. I say this because you do not reward mass murderers, sociopaths, psychopaths, homicidal maniacs, child abductors, king-slayers, child rapists and criminally insane terrorists with amnesty or dialogue. Instead you dispatch them to hell where they belong. It is the same for Boko Haram and all those that secretly collaborate with them.We must not view them as human beings but as savage beasts and demons that eat human flesh and drink human blood. That is what they are: the spoilers and abductors of little girls. They are not worthy of life. They are not worthy of God\u2019s mercy.They are not worthy of our people or of our nation. To destroy them is our holy duty before the Living God: it is God\u2019s will that they should be wiped off the face of the earth and that the Nigerian people should be rid of them forever.Copyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Femi Fani-Kayode: The shame of a nation", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb Opinion \u00bb Femi Fani-Kayode: The shame of a nationPublishedonByI just watched a very sad and disturbing video of our soldiers on the war front begging their President and Commander in Chief to provide them with food and water. They did this through footage which was shot on their cell phone cameras and released as a short video on social media.They were desperate, angry and very loud and some of them were shedding tears about their deep frustration and sorry plight.We saw the lifeless bodies of at least two of them who had apparantly died, not of bullet wounds, but of exhaustion, starvation and lack of water.We saw and heard others as they were slowly dying and we heard their heavy panting and deep groans. We also heard and saw the anger, aggression, loud lamentations and startling complaints from the troops, one of whom had the courage to film the whole thing.He and at least three of his colleagues appealed to those of us that were watching the video on social media to let the President know what they are going through. It was very moving and even the most hardened heart would have melted whilst watching that video.This was a heart-breaking and pathetic scene. These young soldiers had just won a major battle on the war front and they had just recovered numerous towns and villages from Boko Haram yet they were not even given water to quench their thirst or food to fill their stomachs after what was obviously a hard fight. How could things have got so bad?This is the sort of thing that leads to mutiny and rebellion in the military and once that starts no-one is safe and no-one can stop it.I urge the Chief of Army Staff and indeed our President to do something about this problem quickly and ease the suffering and pain of our servicemen and women at the warfront and indeed when they come home.In a country with a civilised government members of the Armed Forces that are prepared to sacrifice their lives just to keep our borders secure and the rest of us safe are cherished and honored. Their salaries are paid promptly and regularly and they are not starved of water and food whilst on the warfront and whilst fighting a battle. The sorry plight of our gallant warriors in todays Nigeria is indeed the shame of the nation.Instead of meeting the needs of our soldiers we are told that the military authorities are sending them to Argentina to learn about cattle-rearing and that they are preparing to set up cattle ranches in every state of the Federation.One wonders why? What purpose does this serve? Is there a hidden agenda? Is it an attempt to smuggle in the rejected Grazing Reserve Bill through the back door? What on earth has cattle-rearing and setting up cattle ranches for itinerant and vagrant herdsmen got to do with soldiering? I guess one does not have to dig too deep to find the answers.These are indeed interesting times and those that seek to utterly demoralise, destroy, demystify and demean the essence, ethos, confidence and very fabric of our Armed Forces and our military men have gone far.Instead of equipping them to fight on the war front and providing them with the necessary provisions on the battle field they are turning them into cattle-rearers, herdsmen and farmers.\nWhat a tragedy!Yet for our country the picture is even more bleak than that. It is not just the military that are going through hell but the people, both high and low, as well.That is what drove Mr. Edwin Dico Okugbo to write the following words out of what can only be described as frustration and anger. He wrote,\u201cBuhari is not fighting against corruption. He is stealing the nation blind. 2015 and 2016 budgets have already been embezzled and they are already moving to 2017. Everyone around him has been exposed already as crooks. Which corruption is he fighting? He is only fighting his enemies to consoldate political power. He is the worst thing that has ever happened to Nigeria. A big scam!\u201dHarsh words indeed yet there can be little doubt that Mr. Okugbo reflects the thinking of many.The bitter truth is that there is unprecedented hardship and suffering in the land. There is also injustice, wickedness, persecution, abuse of power, mass murder, corruption, impunity, religious and ethnic marginalisation, sectarian butchery and conflict, state-sponsored genocide, extra-judicial killings and massive and debilitating poverty. Few are feeling the joy and love of Christmas this season. Yet sadly this is precisely what the Nigerian people wanted.At the risk of our liberty, lives and reputation some of us warned them about the dangers of voting for the great evil of Buhari and his APC.There is nothing that is happening today that I did not accurately predict would happen if Buhari was given power.People laughed me to scorn, insulted me, threatened me, made mockery of me and said that I was wrong but I have been proved right.You see the problem is that most Nigerians do not know the history of their nation and neither can they possibly comprehend the obsessive, narcissistic and sociopathic nature and disposition of most of their leaders.Most of our people are incapable of any form of logical reasoning or analytical deduction that is truly detached from or devoid of emotion and irrational thinking.Worse of all they do not understand the prophetic or what is known as \u201crevelation knowledge\u201d.Knowledge means nothing to them and, simply put, they worship and rever money and power and nothing else.Most Nigerians will do anything, including selling their own heritage, glory and divinely ordained destiny, to have or achieve that money and power or to appease those that possess and wield it.Consequently if a rich man, a powerful politician or a key government official defecates in his pants at a party or a public function the average Nigerian will continue to celebrate him there and then and tell him and the entire world that he smells like roses or like the finest and most expensive perfume in the world. That is how depraved some of us are.\n.We have a terrible aversion to truth and we are very comfortable with living with suffering, wickedness and injustice.In fact the greater the injustice, violence, persecution and wickedness that the state metes out to others the more comfortable and the happier we are.We actually enjoy it and secretly rejoice when those around us and our compatriots suffer pain, death, humiliation, shame, hardship, destruction, injustice and persecution. It is a strange and self-destructive disposition and a devious form of sado-masochism.For example just to spite President Goodluck Jonathan and his Niger Delta people and get him out of power the Nigerian people brought Buhari upon themselves. Can there be a greater example of an entire people cutting their nose to spite their face?This was made all the worse by the fact that Jonathan enjoyed massive support in the south east which has come to be the whipping boy of the Nigerian state. The thinking was that if the Igbo wanted Jonathan then he had to be stopped at all costs.Consequently a radical, angry, vengeful, bitter and divisive Buhari who was viewed and often described by his supporters as the nations \u201cmahdi\u201d and \u201cmessiah\u201d became their choice.They chose him over the gentle, soft-spoken, forgiving, accomodating and humble Jonathan who was maliciously depicted as a clueless, corrupt and incompetent villain.This was a grave error. I say that because the former was malignant and the latter was benign. The former was malevolent and the latter was benevolent.It was rather like the time that the Jews chose our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ over the armed robber and murderer Barabas for crucifixion.It was like choosing night over day. It was like choosing s demon over an angel. It was like choosing evil over good.For the mess we are in today and the disaster and impending doom that our nation is facing I blame those in the core north who introduced religion into our politics and who wanted power back at all costs, those in the Middle Belt who supported them in that quest for reasons best known to themselves and those in the south west that have come to be known as the \u201cJagaban Yorubas\u201d that supported the diabolical and occultic concept of \u201cchanji\u201d.I also blame a small but notable and identifiable section of the media who sold their heritage for a mess of pottage and who have opted to remain silent and, in some cases even openly encourage and support, the evil that has been visited upon us as our nation goes to the dogs.All these groups and individuals have betrayed the Nigerian people. They have destroyed their destinies, enslaved their children, impoverished their lives, shamed their loved ones, dishonored their forefathers, divided their nation, shattered their dreams and set our country back by at least 50 years.The truth is that by the time this is all over we may not even have a country left.Those that voted for this mess and put us in it should enjoy their \u201cchange\u201d and live with the consequences of their stupid choice.Do you know the number of families that cannot even afford to buy turkeys this Christmas? Do you know the number of people that will not get presents or be given Christmas gifts by their parents, siblings, spouses and loved ones this season?Do you know the number of children that will silently shed tears this Christmas and that will secretly wish that they had never been born Nigerians? It has never been this bad in our entire history and it really is so sad.Those that put us in this terrible mess deserve no mercy and no pity. They certainly do not deserve a second mandate in 2019. As for the Nigerian people they have finally got the leadership that they deserve.Our nation needs repentance and prayer. May God forgive and deliver us from His tool of judgement.Permit me to conclude this contribution with the following observations.I was right when I wrote both in 2008 and 2012 that Barack Obama would divide America and the entire world and that by the time he finished his tenure the American people would reject his legacy.I was right when I wrote about what the outcome of the war in Syria would be and how the Americans were making a big mistake by supporting the terrorists, jihadists and islamic fundamentalists and trying to remove Bashar Al Assad.I was right when I wrote that the Americans and the Europeans were making a huge mistake by removing and killing Muammar Ghadaffi of Libya.I was right when I wrote that Europe was making a mistake by allowing in the Syrian refugees who I described at the time as a Trojan horse.I was right when I wrote about the damage that Buhari would do to our land if he was given a mandate to lead the Nigerian people.I was right when I wrote about the damage that Ali Modu Sheriff would do the opposition Peoples Democratic Party if he was given the position of National Chairman.I was right when I wrote that Donald J. Trump would win the presidential primaries of the American Republican Party to become their presidential candidate and when I wrote that he would go on to win the presidential election against Hilary Clinton.I was also right when I wrote that Nana Akufo-Addo would win the presidential election in Ghana.All these things came to me by revelation knowledge and by the power of the Holy Spirit and not by logical deduction or any power of my own.Now let me share another prophetic word with you today by saying the following. For President Muhmmadu Buhari, like the biblical King Belshassar of Babylon, the writing is on the wall. And Like Belshassar he has been weighed and found wanting.Soon he will be gone and the Lord will raise a new leader: a biblical Cyrus with the heart of David, who will heal, unite and prosper our land.This new leader will be a blessing to our people. He will remove our shame, restore our peace, return our joy, rebuild our walls, encourage and strengthen our Church and men and women of God, re-establish our sacred alters, resurrect and re-invoke our covenant with the Living God, defend our borders, jealously guard our people and bring glory and honor to our nation.Thus sayest the Lord and so it shall be. The vision is for an appointed time. Though it tarry, it shall not prove false. God bless you and merry Christmas.Femi Fani-Kayode: The coward called Godswill AkpabioFemi Fani-Kayode: A few good menFemi Fani-Kayode: Biafra, Buhari and his \u2018soft\u2019 Civil WarFemi Fani-Kayode: The sons of Satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 2]Femi Fani-Kayode: The sons of satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 1]Femi Fani-Kayode: When the bully met the headmaster at the White HouseCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Million wounded in Syrian civil war", "classes": [], "content": "Beirut - One million people have been wounded during Syria's civil war and diseases are spreading as regular supplies of medicine fail to reach patients, the World Health Organisation's Syria representative said. A plunge in vaccination rates from 90 percent before the war to 52 percent this year and contaminated water have added to the woes, allowing typhoid and hepatitis to advance, Elizabeth Hoff said in an interview late on Thursday. More than 200,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, which began in March 2011 with popular protests against President Bashar al-Assad and spiralled into civil war after a crackdown by his security forces. \u201cIn Syria, they have a million people injured as a direct result of the war. You can see it in the country when you travel around. You see a lot of amputees,\u201d said Hoff. \u201cThis is the biggest problem.\u201d She said a collapsed health system, where over half of public hospitals are out of service, has meant that treatments for diseases and injuries are irregular. Hoff said that Assad's government - which demands to sign off on aid convoys - is still blocking surgical supplies, such as bandages and syringes, from entering rebel-held areas. Aid workers say Damascus argues that the equipment would be used to help insurgents. \u201cWhat has been a problem is the regularity of supply,\u201d she said. \u201cThe (government) approvals are sporadic.\u201d Syrian officials could not be reached for comment on Thursday or Friday. More than 6,500 cases of typhoid were reported this year across Syria and 4,200 cases of measles, the deadliest disease for Syrian children, Hoff said. There was just one reported case of polio, which can paralyse children within hours, in 2014 following a vaccination drive, but other new diseases appeared, including myiasis, a tropical disease spread by flies which is also known as screw-worm, with 10 cases seen in the outskirts of Damascus. Syrian activists in the Eastern Ghouta district of Damascus said that tuberculosis was also spreading due to poor sanitary conditions and a government siege on the area, blocking aid. The United Nations called on Thursday for more than $8.4 billion to help nearly 18 million people in need in Syria and across the region in 2015. Hoff said that the WHO delivered more than 13.5 million treatments of life saving medicines and medical supplies in 2014, up nearly threefold from the year before. But the problems were growing at an even faster pace, Hoff said, with poor water access and deepening poverty worsening the health crisis: \u201cThe needs are not possible to believe.\u201dTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "\u2018Syria is in civil war\u2019", "classes": [], "content": "Syria is heading for collapse and will become a \u201cwarehouse of weapons\u201d for Islamist militants as it descends into chaos, a senior Israeli army commander said. \u201cSyria is in civil war, which will lead to a failed state, and terrorism will blossom in it,\u201d said Major-General Yair Golan, making a rare public appearance at a conference at Bar Ilan University on Wednesday. \u201cSyria has a big arsenal.\u201d The Arab republic's stock of mainly Russian-made weapons includes surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles and marine missiles. It also possesses chemical weapons which Syria never used in its wars against Israel but which could be attractive weapons for militants, the general said. \u201cThe risk to Israel is taking shape,\u201d said Golan, who is commander of Israeli forces on the border with Lebanon and the disengagement line with Syria in the Golan Heights. \u201cThe challenge we are facing is a huge one,\u201d he added, according to a translation. The Israel Defence Forces were \u201cdeeply engaged in getting ready, with plans and physical means\u201d along the borders, the Northern Command chief said, without offering specific details. It was very difficult to forecast how Syria would break up, Golan said. It could be effectively \u201ccantonised\u201d by the conflict that has raged for 14 months since President Bashar al-Assad turned his army on protesters and a rebel force fought back. Golan said Assad's ally Iran was trying hard to help the president stay in power, and Iran's Lebanese ally Hezbollah was in turn a very determined enemy of Israel which has \u201cno intention of letting us off easily\u201d. Hezbollah \u201cfeel obligated to their guardian (Iran) and when needed they are going to do what Iran is interested in\u201d, he told an academic audience at the Begin-Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies. Hezbollah is the most potent hostile military force directly on one of Israel's borders, but it has done nothing evident in the past 14 months to exploit the Syrian crisis or start trouble with Israel to divert attention from Assad's bloody crackdown. The Shi'a movement was focused on creating a \u201ccomprehensive ballistic array\u201d, Golan said. At the moment, most of the estimated 60 000 rockets and missiles Hezbollah has in place are short-range, low-payload rockets. \u201cIt's not nice to live under this threat in northern Israel, but this type of threat is not a decisive factor against Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cLet's not exaggerate when we talk about it.\u201d Hezbollah also has longer-range and more accurate missiles and hopes to obtain more to threaten all of Israel, he said. If Hezbollah were to attack, however, it could expect massive retaliation which would not be limited to Israeli air power, Golan said. Reliance on air power alone was \u201can hallucination\u201d. There would also be a war of \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d, he said, signifying a land offensive. \u201cWe need a combined effort,\u201d Golan told the conference. In the event of a third Lebanon war, he said, the IDF would aim to \u201cset back the next threat for a long time by hitting them (Hezbollah) very hard so they won't feel like engaging us again for many, many years\u201d. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to dislodge Palestinian militants operating in the country. It finally withdrew its forces in 2000, but went back to war in 2006, clashing with Hezbollah guerrillas. About 1 200 people, mainly civilians, died in Lebanon in the subsequent fighting, along with 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers. - ReutersTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Syria\u2019s civil war eclipsed by IS terror", "classes": [], "content": "Damascus - As Syria's civil war rages into a fifth year, the daily suffering of its people has been overshadowed by atrocities committed by the Islamic State group that have sparked international horror.Four years after anti-regime protests broke out on March 15, 2011, jihadists control large tracts of territory, a defiant President Bashar al-Assad is clinging to power and revolutionary dreams have faded.The sickening tactics of IS have captured the world's attention in a conflict that has killed more than 210 000 people.With a brutality shown to the world in their own slick film productions, the jihadists have beheaded hostages, hung the bodies of \u201cinfidels\u201d and \u201cspies\u201d from crosses, and thrown homosexuals from rooftops.They have paraded caged prisoners and enslaved women through the streets, released gruesome videos of the murder of Western hostages and burned alive a Jordanian fighter pilot.They have attacked minority communities and destroyed ancient artefacts.\u201cIS has gone so far in its horror that it has succeeded in persuading the West that it represents the ultimate enemy, and that everyone else is a lesser evil,\u201d said Karim Bitar, researcher at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Relations.\u201cWe have therefore returned to the state of mind that looks at everything through the prism of the war against terrorism,\u201d he told AFP.IS began gaining prominence in 2013 as an al-Qaeda affiliate before essentially being disowned by the global extremist network.After initially avoiding confrontation with the Syrian army, it began openly fighting the regime the next year.By then, IS had captured territory in Syria's north and east from anti-regime rebels and al-Qaeda's official Syrian branch Al-Nusra Front.Last June IS declared an Islamic \u201ccaliphate\u201d spanning swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq.Foreign fighters have streamed into Syria to join the jihadist ranks, causing alarm overseas about the prospect of battle-hardened militants coming home. By agreeing in 2013 to hand over its chemical weapons to a global watchdog, Syria ensured that the West would not intervene militarily against Assad, even after a deadly chemical attack that killed hundreds outside Damascus.With a US-led coalition now waging daily air strikes against the jihadists, the West increasingly sees Assad as a potential partner in the war against IS.Calls for his departure have fallen by the wayside. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura recently described Assad as \u201cpart of the solution\u201d.\u201cWe have begun to think once again, like we did before the Arab revolutions, that authoritarianism is a lesser evil and that we should engage authoritarian regimes,\u201d Bitar said.In a recent interview with Portuguese television, a confident Assad brushed off Syria's uprising as a Western conspiracy, much like he did in the very first stages of the revolt.\u201cHow could a revolution collapse or fail if you have the support of the West, the support of regional countries, all this money and armaments and so on?\u201d he said.\u201cYou supposed that he's a dictator who is killing his good people, so the people are against him, regional countries are against him, and the West is against him - and he succeeded,\u201d Assad said, referring to himself. The revolution has evolved into a complex conflict with many sides - from regime forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah Shi'a militants and Iranian military officers to opposition rebels, jihadist rivals and Kurdish militia.\u201cIn the first few years of the Syrian revolution, there were two clearly identified sides to the conflict. Today, it's a war of everyone against everyone,\u201d said Bitar.The past year saw a dramatic decline of the Western-backed rebel Free Syrian Army, which after some initial military gains against Assad's forces has since been reduced to a sprinkling of weak and underfunded groups.Syria's economy and infrastructure have been destroyed. Hunger and cold knock on every door.More than 12 million people are in need of humanitarian aid and over 11 million have fled their homes.Emile Hokayem, senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, does not expect a political solution in the foreseeable future.\u201cThe levels of violence may drop because a lot of people have already been killed and there will be a transfer of population,\u201d he said.\u201cBut it's very difficult to see Syria being put together any time soon.\u201dPro-democracy activists have lost hope.\u201cWhat revolution are we talking about now? I am totally convinced the international community has no conscience,\u201d said Yazan Homsy, who endured a nearly two-year regime siege of his home city Homs.Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "War is costing us trillions - Report", "classes": [], "content": "Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Putin warns of Syria civil war, won\u2019t intervene", "classes": [], "content": "Berlin - Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Friday that Syria could be on the brink of a civil war but underlined his opposition to military intervention to stop the bloodshed.\u201cYou cannot do anything by force,\u201d he told reporters in Berlin, after he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed after talks that they sought a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the crisis.Putin said the deadly strife in Syria risked tearing the country in two.\u201cToday we are seeing emerging elements of civil war,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt is extremely dangerous.\u201dBut he hit back at suggestions Moscow was supplying arms for use in Syria, saying his country did not deliver weapons to be deployed in civil conflicts.\u201cAs far as arms supplies are concerned, Russia does not supply the weapons that could be used in a civil conflict,\u201d he said.The president, on his first trip to the West since returning to the Kremlin for a third term, insisted his country was not siding with President Bashar al-Assad's regime against the opposition.\u201cWe are supporting neither side from which the danger of civil war is coming,\u201d he said.And he stressed that a negotiated solution was the only answer to the crisis.\u201cThis is what we talked about with the German chancellor \u00c4 to find a political solution to these problems.

Air strikes killed dozens of people in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor said, and weary residents continued to stream out on foot as Russian-backed government forces pressed their campaign to capture the last big rebel bastion near Damascus.On another front, Turkish and allied Syrian rebel forces shelled the northern Kurdish-held town of Afrin, killing at least 18 people and forcing 2 500 people to flee, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported.The Kurdish YPG militia, defending Afrin, said it was fighting the Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies who tried to storm the town from the north.The two offensives, one backed by Russia and the other led by Turkey, have shown how Syrian factions and their foreign allies are aggressively reshaping the map of control after the defeat of Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate last year.The Syrian war entered its eighth year this week having killed half a million people and driven more than 11 million from their homes, including nearly 6 million who have fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times.The government launched its assault on eastern Ghouta a month ago and Turkey began its cross-border campaign in Afrin in January. In both cases, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped inside areas on the battlefield.Backed by Russia and Iran, government forces have thrust deep into eastern Ghouta, splintering the area into three separate enclaves. The UN believes up to 400 000 people have been trapped inside the rebel-held area of densely populated farms and satellite towns on the outskirts of the capital, with virtually no access to food or medicine.For the first time since the government unleashed the Ghouta offensive, one of the deadliest of the war, residents are fleeing in their thousands, carrying children and belongings on foot from rebel-held territory to reach government positions.Moscow and Damascus accuse the rebels of having forced people to stay in harm\u2019s way to use them as human shields. The rebels deny this and say the aim of the government assault is to depopulate opposition areas.Syrian State TV broadcast footage of men, women and children walking along a dirt road near the town of Hammouriyeh, many of them carrying bags, to escape rebel-held areas. Some waved to the camera and said the rebels had stopped them from leaving.Around 5 000 people were sheltering at the nearby town of Adra and many more were expected to arrive this weekend, the Adra mayor said.The exodus began on Thursday with thousands fleeing the southernmost of the three Ghouta pockets. Russia said more than 12,000 people left on Thursday.The eastern Ghouta town of Douma, where many people are sheltering, has been spared the worst of the shelling in recent days, a resident said. - Reuters/African News Agency (ANA)Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

Hundreds are believed to have been killed since last Saturday, and the humanitarian conditions in the city have been worsening.Homs was under \u201cbrutal shelling\u201d on Tuesday, the Local Coordination Committees activist group said, citing its network of witnesses on the ground.Another activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said it was the heaviest shelling in days.With diplomatic efforts bogged down, the conflict in Syria is taking on the dimensions of a civil war, with army defectors clashing almost daily with soldiers.UN human rights chief Navi Pillay warned on Monday that the Security Council's failure to take action has emboldened the Syrian government to launch an all-out assault.The uprising began last March as mostly peaceful protests against Assad's authoritarian rule, but has become more militarised in the face of the brutal military crackdown.Pillay told the General Assembly that more than 5 400 people were killed last year alone, and the number of dead and injured continues to rise daily.She said tens of thousands of people, including children, have been arrested, more than 18 000 reportedly are still arbitrarily detained and thousands more are reported missing. In addition, 25 000 people are estimated to have sought refuge in neighbouring countries and more than 70 000 are internally displaced.\u201cThe breadth and patterns of attacks by military and security forces on civilians, and the widespread destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure indicate approval or complicity by authorities at the highest level,\u201d Pillay said.Also Monday, the Obama administration said it backs Arab League plans to end continuing violence in Syria but noted several obstacles to deploying a proposed international peacekeeping force to the country and withheld full endorsement of the idea.The administration has said repeatedly it does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, yet US officials indicated they would consider the Arab League call for peacekeepers and discuss it with various countries to see whether such an idea is feasible. However, they stressed there would be difficulties in getting required UN Security Council authorisation for a force.Chief among the hurdles is opposition by Russia and China, which vetoed a far less ambitious Security Council action already this month. Russia has said peacekeepers could not be sent without Syrian government approval; officials in Damascus already have rejected the proposal, calling it unjustified interference in internal affairs. - Sapa-APTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Syria faces catastrophic civil war: Ban", "classes": [], "content": "Damascus -UN chief Ban Ki-moon warned on Thursday that Syria risks a \u201ccatastrophic civil war\u201d following a massacre that sparked global outrage, as the United States criticised Russia for resisting tougher UN action.Syrian rebels threatened to escalate their operations unless the government of President Bashar al-Assad falls in line by midday (0900 GMT) on Friday with a six-point peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan.Ban, addressing a forum in Istanbul, made it clear he too expected Damascus to implement Annan's blueprint, which includes a ceasefire that should have taken effect on April 12 but has been violated daily ever since.\u201cI demand that the government of Syria act on its commitment to the Annan peace plan,\u201d the UN chief said.\u201cThe massacres of the sort seen last weekend could plunge Syria into a catastrophic civil war, a civil war from which the country would never recover.\u201dHe was referring to a slaughter near the central town of Houla on Friday and Saturday of 108 people, including 49 children and 34women.The assault prompted Western governments, including the United States, Britain, France and Australia, to expel the senior Syrian diplomats in their countries.In Denmark, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Russia's policy of resisting UN Security Council action against Damascus could contribute to a civil war.The Russians \u201care telling me they don't want to see a civil war. I have been telling them their policy is going help to contribute to a civil war,\u201d she told a mainly student audience in Copenhagen.Clinton warned that unless checked, the deadly violence in Syria could even develop into a proxy war because of Iran's support for the Assad's regime.A team led by Annan visited Syria earlier this week and called for \u201cconcrete gestures\u201d from Assad on halting the violence.But with Annan receiving no firm commitments from the Syrian leader, the rebel Free Syrian Army's command inside the country gave the president an ultimatum on Thursday.A statement said that if the regime \u201cdoes not meet the deadline by Friday midday, the command ... will no longer be tied by any commitment to the Annan plan ... and our duty will be ... to defend civilians.\u201dSpeaking in reaction to the \u201cbarbarous\u201d massacre, the FSA said \u201cthere is no more justification for us to unilaterally respect the truce because (Assad) has buried Annan's plan.\u201dIt said it would announce in the coming days \u201ca series of decisive and courageous decisions for the next phase\u201d of its struggle.Indicating serious divisions within the ranks, Turkey-based FSA chief Colonel Riyadh al-Asaad prompted a sharp retort from the leadership inside Syria after he denied there had been an ultimatum.Colonel Kassem Saadeddine, speaking to AFP from Syria, said:\u201cFrom now on, all decisions will be taken from inside Syria. Anyone who wants to speak in the name of the FSA should do it from the battlefield, not through media.\u201dThe United States, France, Britain and Germany all emerged from a Security Council meeting on Wednesday urging stronger measures by the body.US ambassador Susan Rice said if Damascus did not adhere to the Annan plan, then the council had to \u201cassume its responsibilities\u201d and step up pressure.In the absence of either scenario, and if the violence continued to worsen, \u201cthen members of this council and members of the international community are left with the option only of having to consider whether they're prepared to take actions outside of the Annan plan and the authority of this council.\u201dHer remarks appeared to signal that Washington and its allies would consider acting alone if Russia and China continued to block tough action.But the US envoy to NATO said on Thursday military action was not under consideration.\u201cThe issue of military intervention, which is also always complex, is not right now on the table when it comes to Syria,\u201d he said.Russia and China, which have both blocked previous attempts at the Security Council to condemn Assad, joined other council members on Sunday in approving a statement condemning the Houla massacre.But Russia insists that that rebuke went far enough and that further action would be counter-productive.President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said that stance would not change under pressure.\u201cRussia's position is well-known. It is balanced and consistent,\u201d Interfax quoted spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying on Thursday. \u201cSo it is hardly appropriate to talk about this position changing under someone's pressure.\u201dOn the ground, Syrian forces resumed shelling in Houla, which had begun on Wednesday, with a young boy killed by a sniper, the Observatory said.And battles raged as troops and rebels clashed across the country, with the Observatory saying at least 13 other people were killed. - Sapa-AFPTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Why the US can't afford to cede control of Syria", "classes": [], "content": "Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "UN rights chief warns of civil war in Syria", "classes": [], "content": "The UN human rights chief warned on Friday of an all-out war in Syria unless international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan is implemented and called for an international probe into the killing of more than 100 people in the country.In an address to the UN Human Rights Council on the massacre in Houla, where UN officials say 49 children were among those killed, Pillay urged the Security Council to refer the massacre to the International Criminal Court in the Hague.\u201cThere is a need for prompt, independent and impartial international investigations into all serious human rights violations in Syria, including those that have occurred in Houla,\u201d Pillay said in remarks delivered by one of her deputies in Geneva.The council was set to vote later in the day on whether to launch such an investigation.Syrian envoy Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui blamed the attack on \u201cterrorists,\u201d which is how the Syrian government referred to rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.\u201cThe situation in Syria might descend into a full-fledged conflict and the future of the country, as well as the region as a whole could be in grave danger,\u201d she added.Annan was in Lebanon to discuss his peace plan, which calls for a halt to fighting, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from urban areas, a daily humanitarian ceasefire, as well as media access and political dialogue between rebels and government soldiers.A seven-week ceasefire brokered by Annan appears to be crumbling, raising fears of a civil war.Russia, Syria's main ally, has come under western criticism for its backing of al-Assad.

While no one has yet provided evidence of its involvement, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country\u2019s seven-year civil war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the regime carried out a wave of air strikes on Douma on Friday and Saturday that killed nearly 100 people, including many who suffered breathing difficulties.

(AFP)\nRape is a \"significant and disturbing\" feature of the Syrian civil war, with women and girls citing sexual violence as their main reason for fleeing the country, according to a report published on Monday.\nWomen and girls told the International Rescue Committee of being attacked in public and in their homes, primarily by armed men. The rapes, sometimes by several men, often occurred in front of family members.\n\"The stories we've heard, talking to Syrian women, are truly horrific,\" said Sanj Srikanthan, emergency field director of the International Rescue Committee in the UK.\n\"Many of these women have experienced rape and torture in Syria, but as refugees [they] can't find the support they need to heal their physical and emotional scars \u2013 let alone provide food and shelter for their families.\"\nDuring interviews with 240 Syrian women and girls in Lebanon and Jordan, the committee learned of attacks involving kidnap, rape, torture and murder, with Syria's many roadblocks a particular danger.\nSexual violence recurence\nThe International Rescue Committee said it was impossible to give figures, but its report draws attention to the use of rape as a strategy in war. Sexual violence occurs in every humanitarian crisis, notably during the Balkan wars and in conflicts in parts of Africa, and Syria is no exception.\nIn a report in June, Human Rights Watch said Syria's government forces used sexual violence to torture men, women and boys detained in the conflict.\nLast year, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative to highlight these issues. The foreign office assembled a team of 70 doctors, lawyers, forensic experts and psychologists who can be deployed to conflict areas.\nHague told Parliament last week that the UK is sending specialists to deal with rape and sexual violence in Syria.\n\"We've deployed experts to the region to provide training in how to respond to reports of sexual violence, to improve the prospect of future investigation and prosecutions, and we will intensify this work as a matter of urgency,\" he said.\nEstimated death toll\nMembers of the team will train local health professionals to gather medical and forensic evidence and documentation that can be used in prosecutions. Hague said in the past Britain would use its presidency of the G8 group of industrialised countries this year to push for a new international protocol on the investigation and documentation of sexual violence in conflict.\nThe UN estimated the death toll during nearly two years of civil war in Syria at 60\u00a0000. More than 2.5-million people, from a population of 22.5-million, fled their homes, with 612\u00a0000 people registered as refugees in neighbouring countries.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees agency said on Friday that harsh winter conditions, including freezing rain, made life even more difficult for refugees.\nThe UN World Food Programme in the past warned it was unable to deliver food to up to one-million hungry and desperate Syrians because of spiralling violence across the country and a lack of fuel. The UN appealed for $1.5-billion for the first six months of this year \u2013 the largest short-term UN appeal \u2013 but it remained seriously underfunded.\nThe International Rescue Committee said aid was drastically insufficient to meet existing needs, let alone the barest requirements to respond to a lengthy humanitarian emergency and post-conflict recovery.\nStates of refuge\nRefugee camps gained much media attention, yet most Syrian refugees are in towns and cities in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey, the committee added. In a grim irony, Iraq and Syria have reversed their previous roles as states of refuge.\nIraq now hosts 67\u00a0000 refugees, whereas five years ago Iraqis fled to Syria. Lebanon has received more than 200\u00a0000 Syrian refugees, Jordan 176\u00a0500 and Turkey more than 148\u00a0000.\n\"While some Syrians are housed by host families in cramped quarters, most are renting small, dilapidated unfurnished apartments that they increasingly cannot afford,\" said the committee.\n\"Others find shelter in sheds, barns, basements and abandoned buildings unfit for habitation. Some are offered shelter by local authorities in unused public spaces.\"\nUrban refugees are straining the education, health and water facilities of host countries. Rents have gone up for both refugees and locals, and tension is on the rise.\nThe committee's report also described the deliberate targeting of medical and health care facilities by the Syrian government. Doctors told the committee of a systematic campaign to restrict access to health care through strategic bombing, forcing the closure of hospitals.\nThe International Rescue Committee urged donors to significantly increase bilateral aid to host countries to help offset the strain on their infrastructure and ease tension. The US gave $100-million to Jordan, but the committee said donors should give more to Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.\nThe body said donors must recognise sexual violence as a feature of the Syrian conflict, as well as the threats Syrian women and girls face as refugees and the shortage of quality services available to them, and develop an appropriate strategy to address the crisis. \u2013 \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2013\u00a0We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

But it will be a huge step towards this end.\u201dSince it began in March 2011, the war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half the population homeless and created the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis.Government forces scored an important victory on Wednesday when the rebels retreated from the Old City, the historic heart of Aleppo.They extended their advances later in the day, seizing the Bab al-Nayrab, al-Ma\u2019adi and al-Salhin neighbourhoods, according to state media.More neighbourhoods were expected to fall soon, but rebels were fighting ferociously.Syria state television reported that rebel shelling killed 14 civilians and wounded 70 others, some critically, targeting government-held districts in west Aleppo.In a blistering three-week offensive, Syrian forces have seized about 80% of east Aleppo, a stronghold for rebel groups since 2012.Increasingly cornered in a pocket of territory in the city\u2019s southeast, opposition factions on Wednesday called for an \u201cimmediate five-day humanitarian ceasefire\u201d.When asked about the possibility of a truce in Aleppo, al-Assad said, \u201cit\u2019s practically nonexistent, of course\u201d.\u201cThe Americans in particular are insisting on demanding a truce, because their terrorist agents are now in a difficult situation,\u201d al-Assad told al-Watan.He said a rebel loss in Aleppo \u201cwill mean the transformation of the course of the war across Syria\u201d.Russia is in favour of continuing contacts between United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in an effort to reach a deal over Aleppo, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.He said the prospects for an agreement were unclear: \u201cAs previously, there are more questions than answers.\u201d Lavrov and Kerry met in Hamburg, Germany, on Wednesday.\nA US official said they probably discussed a safe passage for rebels out of Aleppo.\u201cThe Russians want the fighters out and they [the Americans] are ready to co-ordinate over that,\u201d said an official with an Aleppo rebel group, who declined to be named.Although rebels say they could fend off the offensive for some time to come, the fighting is complicated by tens of thousands of fearful civilians trapped in the rebel-held east, many related to the fighters, the official said.\u201cThe civilian burden is very heavy, in a small area.\u201dMany people have also streamed from areas rebels have left and are crammed into abandoned homes while air raids and shellfire fall around them, hoping to escape before Aleppo is retaken.A United Nations official said about 31\u2009500 people from east Aleppo have been displaced around the city over the past week, with hundreds more seen on the move on Wednesday.Residents say up to 20\u2009000 people have fled their homes in recent days for other opposition areas. About 18\u2009000 people had sought refuge in government-held areas, the UN said last week. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the number was probably in the tens of thousands.As winter sets in, siege conditions are increasingly desperate, exacerbated by the high number of displaced residents.With hospitals, clinics, water and food supplies cut off, UN chief Ban Ki-moon called the situation heartbreaking. \u2014 Al Jazeera, ReutersGet the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

The opposition frontSome 50 delegates representing different factions within the Syrian opposition arrived in the Swiss city of Geneva over the weekend in preparation for the talks.The unity of the opposition front will be put to the test on Tuesday.\nDisagreement over the future role of President Bashar al-Assad in a transitional government has considerably weakened the opposition\u2019s capability to negotiate a favourable way out of the crisis over the past few months.Statements issued by the opposition after a two-day meeting in Riyadh last week did not clarify how this critical issue would play out.According to a statement issued by the Riyadh conference on Friday, \u201cthe participants stressed that the transition cannot happen without the departure of Bashar al-Assad and his circle at the start of the interim period\u201d. Hours later, however, Nasr Hariri, the new chief negotiator for the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), Syria\u2019s main opposition group, told reporters that the opposition was ready to discuss \u201ceverything on the negotiating table\u201d without preconditions.Early last week, Hariri replaced Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister, who led the HNC for almost two years. Hijab, a hardliner, hinted in a statement that the HNC had faced pressure to make concessions in favour of Assad. His departure led to speculation that the group may soften its stance towards the Syrian president and his role in the transitional period.Significantly, Hijab\u2019s resignation came as Assad made a televised appearance next to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, where the Russian leader, a staunch supporter of Assad, held a meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss the Syria crisis.\u201cIt is important to reach a political settlement now, and Assad is ready to work with anyone who wants peace,\u201d said the Russian president, who later announced he would convene a Syria Congress at the beginning of December in Sochi.Appearing strong in the wake of the successful fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group ( ISIL, also known as ISIS) and major territorial gains after two years of Russian and Iranian military interventions that reversed the conquests of the opposition, Assad now has the upper hand in the negotiations. Lasting conflictAnalysts were sceptical that the Geneva talks would make any progress towards a political settlement.\u201cThere will not be a formal Geneva-style diplomatic settlement, whether under UN auspices or other,\u201d said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. According to Sayigh, the Russia-backed Astana talks, a parallel track to the UN-sponsored peace process, aim to reintegrate the Syrian opposition under the current state system.Marwan Kabalan, an analyst with the Doha Institute, noted that the fate of Assad would long remain a contentious issue: \u201cA significant part of the country in the north and south, holding most of the oil and water reserves, is not under the control of the regime. This means the conflict will last much, much longer than people expect.\u201dThe final communique from the opposition in Riyadh focused primarily on rejecting Iran\u2019s interference in Syria. Saudi Arabia has thrown its weight behind a number of opposition groups and has pushed for the removal of Assad in a bid to contain Iran\u2019s growing hegemony in the region.But the Sochi meeting was emblematic of a new geopolitical reality, wherein Assad and his allies will continue to play a dominant role in Syria and the rest of the region. Humanitarian crisisSyria\u2019s civil war , now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.In its 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview on Syria , published last week, the UN said that the scale and severity of needs across Syria remain overwhelming. Some 13 million people require humanitarian assistance, including 5.6 million in acute need due to limited access to basic goods and services.Of the 5.5 million Syrian refugees worldwide, most of whom remain in neighbouring countries, a very limited number have returned to Syria. In 2017, around 720,000 people returned to their areas of origin. \u2014\u00a0Al JazeeraGet the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

South Africa\u2019s policy on Syria has rarely strayed from that of its Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China) partners \u2013 it will not support any moves to remove President Bashar al-Assad.On Wednesday, the department said it condemned the strikes but\u00a0maintained\u00a0its support\u00a0of the sovereignty of Syria, and that a military solution to the conflict is not possible.South Africa has said it would\u00a0not support sanctions of any kind against Syria or Israel, in spite of calls for boycotts on home soil.Kathrada's 'surprise'\nThis week, Archbishop Emeritus\u00a0Desmond Tutu\u00a0and struggle icon\u00a0Ahmed Kathrada\u00a0called on\u00a0actor Morgan Freeman\u00a0to explain his decision to accept an Israeli award.\nFreeman was nominated for the Key of Knowledge award by the Canadian Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem on\u00a0Monday. The award was purportedly for his philanthropic work.Tutu reportedly wrote to Freeman to ask him to explain his decision to accept the award. Kathrada,\u00a0meanwhile, wrote to Freeman expressing his \u201csurprise\u201d that he had accepted the award.\u00a0Both Tutu and Kathrada are openly\u00a0opposed to\u00a0Israel's oppression of Palestine.World-renowned physicist\u00a0Stephen Hawking\u00a0joined their call this week by joining an academic boycott of Israel. Hawking had initially accepted an invitation to speak at a conference hosted by Israel's\u00a0President Shimon Peres.The British Committee for the Universities of Palestine published a statement, reportedly with Hawking\u2019s backing, saying he had changed his mind about attending the conference based on his knowledge of Palestine, and upon the advice of his Palestinian contacts.South Africa previously condemned Israeli attacks on Palestine without supporting boycotts of Israel.Department of international relations spokesperson\u00a0Clayson Monyela\u00a0said the second and third air strikes against Syria constituted a \u201cserious\u201d breach of international law.\u201cThese attacks are an extremely dangerous escalation of the crisis in Syria,\u00a0which could have dire implications for the stability of the entire Middle East region.\u00a0South Africa calls for calm and implores countries of the region to refrain from further military action,\u201d Monyela said.\u00a0'Disastrous consequences'\nMonyela said any foreign involvement or military action in Syria would\u00a0have \u201cdisastrous consequences for the region\u201d.\u00a0\u201cIt is further essential that the supply of foreign weapons to all parties in Syria be stopped as it results in the increasing militarisation of the conflict.\u201cSouth Africa has persistently called on all the parties in\u00a0the conflict to stop the violence as well as respect and protect the rights of the Syrian population,\" he said.\u201cSince the beginning of the Syrian crisis, South Africa has condemned all human rights abuses in particular violations of the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and children. All the parties in\u00a0the current conflict have the responsibility to protect and preserve human rights.\u201cSouth Africa reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria and maintains that any political transition must reflect the will of the Syrian people.\u00a0South Africa rejects any calls for regime change and outside military interference or any action not in line with the Charter of the United Nations,\u201d Monyela said.\u00a0He said the country\u00a0further supports the efforts of the joint special envoy of the United Nations and League of Arab States,\u00a0Lakhdar Brahimi, \u201ctowards moving the parties to the negotiating table\".\u201cThe only sustainable resolution to the conflict is if the parties agree, without precondition, to meet each other in dialogue to discuss the future Syrian political dispensation along the lines agreed to in the Geneva Communiqu\u00e9 of 2012,\u201d Monyela said.\u00a0'Provocation'\nANC deputy secretary general\u00a0Jesse Duarte\u00a0also condemned Israel's\u00a0attacks, calling them a \u201cprovocation\u201d that\u00a0would only escalate hostilities in the region.\u201cWe believe that the cessation of hostilities by all protagonists is a precondition for the evasive attempt to save lives and bring\u00a0about lasting peace,\u201d she said.\u00a0The party, like the international relations department, was quick to point out its support for the sovereignty of Syria. \u00a0\u201cWe call on the United Nations to prevail on external forces to respect the sovereignty of Syria and to allow Syrians to work together in resolving their disputes,\u201d she said.South Africa joined its other two Brics\u00a0partners, Brazil and India, in abstaining from the 2011 UN Security Council vote, along with Lebanon. Opponents of the resolution, like South Africa, refuse to condemn the Assad regime.\u00a0Further developments saw India, Brazil and South Africa again refusing to condemn the Assad regime.No military solution\nIn July last year, Deputy Minister of International Relations\u00a0Ebrahim Ebrahim\u00a0said South Africa believed there was no military solution to the conflict.\u00a0\"The international community must urgently respond to the escalating violence in Syria in a stern and balanced manner, based on the realities on the ground. \u00a0It is incumbent on the UN Security Council to express strong and unified support for Mr [Kofi]\u00a0Annan and to call on all parties to cease the violence immediately.\"The UN charter after all determines that the Security Council should make proposals for conflict resolution and address failures of implementation with its decisions, and that it should do so: 'without prejudice to the rights, claims and positions of the parties concerned'.\u00a0\"South Africa will therefore support any decision of the Security Council that is balanced and geared towards supporting Mr Annan\u2019s call for all sides in the conflict to adhere to their commitments under his six point plan,\u201d Ebrahim said.An Algerian diplomat replaced Annan at the helm of the UN Arab League Special Envoy to Syria in September last year.In March this year, reports emerged that a missile \u2013 a chemical weapon \u2013 was fired into a Syrian province, killing 31 people and injuring a further 100.\u00a0Again, South Africa held its line by\u00a0condemning\u00a0the violence and the use of chemical weapons; it said there was no military solution to the crisis in Syria, but it would not call for Assad to step down.\u00a0Ebrahim said in March that\u00a0\u201cSouth Africa reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria\".\"The only way to stop the further destruction of Syrian society is for the parties to come together in dialogue without delay.\"Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(Reuters)\"There are no winds of war,\" Yair Golan, the general commanding Israeli forces on the Syrian and Lebanese fronts, told reporters while out jogging with troops.\u00a0\"Do you see tension? There is no tension. Do I look tense to you?\" he said, according to the Maariv NRG news website.Intelligence sources said Israel attacked Iranian-supplied missiles stored near the Syrian capital on Friday and Sunday as they awaited transport to Assad's Lebanese guerrilla ally Hezbollah.Israel has repeatedly warned it will not let high-tech weaponry get to Iranian-backed Hezbollah, with which it fought an inconclusive war in 2006.\u00a0Damascus accused Israel of belligerence meant to support outgunned anti-Assad rebels.The air strikes were tantamount to a \"declaration of war\", it said, and threatened unspecified retaliation.Veteran Israeli lawmaker Tzachi Hanegbi, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Monday that Israel did not want to clash with Assad.Interviewed on Israel Radio, Hanegbi said the Netanyahu government aimed to avoid \"an increase in tension with Syria by making clear that if there is activity, it is only against Hezbollah, not against the Syrian regime\".Israel is reluctant to take sides in Syria's civil war for fear its actions would boost Islamists who are even more hostile to it than the Assad family, which has maintained a stable stand off with the Jewish state for decades.Hanegbi said Israel had not formally acknowledged carrying out the raids in an effort to allow Assad to save face, adding that Netanyahu began a scheduled week-long trip to China on Sunday to signal the sense of business as usual.The Israel prime minister did not comment about Syria during a visit to Shanghai on Monday.'Diplomatic channels'\nYedioth Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, said the Netanyahu government had informed Assad through diplomatic channels that it did not intend to meddle in Syria's civil war.Israeli officials did not immediately confirm the report, but one suggested that such indirect contacts were not required.\"Given the public remarks being made by senior Israeli figures to reassure Assad, it's pretty clear what the message is,\" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Al-Ikhbariya, a pro-government Syrian television station, on Sunday said Assad had rockets ready to fire at Israel if it struck again.Damascus would also permit guerrilla attacks against Israel across the Golan Heights, Al-Ikhbariya said.\nHanegbi said Israel was ready for any development if the Syrians misinterpreted its messages and was ready \"to respond harshly if indeed there is aggression against us\".As a precaution, Israel deployed two of its five Iron Dome rocket interceptors near the Syrian and Lebanese fronts and grounded civilian aircraft in the area, although an Israeli military spokesperson\u00a0said the airspace would reopen on Monday.Analysts say Syria would be no match for Israel, a US\u00a0defence ally, in any military showdown. But Damascus, with its leverage over Hezbollah, could still consider proxy attacks through Lebanon. Tehran, which has long backed Assad, whose Alawite minority has religious ties to Shi'ite Islam, denied Israel's attack was on arms.

(Antonio, Pampliega, AFP)After two years of civil war in Syria, more than 70\u00a0000 men, women and children have been killed, according to the United Nations.Nonprofit organisations from around the world have been flocking to the Syrian border, but many are turned away, as the government of Bashar al-Assad has cracked down on international humanitarian entering the country.But there are some, including South Africans, who manage to get inside, and make their difference in the war, which began when government forces killed several civilians at a protest for the release of political prisoners.One of these South Africans is 29-year-old Venessa Naidoo, an anaesthetist who works with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.Naidoo, who is currently furthering her studies\u00a0at the University of Cape Town, has been on missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan under threat of bombs, and in South Sudan, operating out of a tent.Recently, she spent a few months in the north of Syria, where she worked with a Belgian doctor and two nurses in a makeshift hospital run out of a chicken farm.\"That's not the worst though,\" she tells the Mail & Guardian. \"We used to operate in a cave.\nBut with all the shelling, it became unsustainable to stay in the cave.\"Hands-on experience\nBut she sees humanitarian medical assistance as the \"best work\" she's ever done.\"The training we get in South Africa is perfect for working in the field,\" she says.\"When you do your community service in the rural areas, you have to learn to cope on your own. Young doctors often complain about this, but it's this kind of confidence that you need when there's no one to call on for help. A lot of people who train overseas don't get the same hands-on experience that we get.\"Naidoo learnt her skills running a rural hospital in Caledon with only two doctor colleagues.She says that it helps, funnily enough, that South African doctors are used to trauma, such as stab wounds, while European doctors aren't exposed to the same kind of violent injuries.\"Also, in South Africa, we do a lot of obstetrics training, right through our internships and community service. This really helps because as a female doctor, most women in Syria felt more comfortable with a woman in that regard.\"Naidoo can't say the name of the city the hospital was in, for security reasons.Since the government doesn't know they are there, they have to be smuggled in across the border unofficially.\"It's quite a process,\" she says. \"We have to cross from Turkey by foot. On the one side we meet with smugglers who take us over a mountain, through rivers, it's quite a hike. Once we are on the other side, we get fetched by contacts in Syria and then taken to the hospital.\"They cannot set up shop at a normal hospital, she says, because government forces still target hospitals, which makes them\u00a0unsafe.Winter months\nWorking on\u00a0the farm means that during the winter months, the hospital is freezing cold, and impossible to heat because fuel is too\u00a0expensive and there is no electricity.Naidoo talks about the types of injuries she saw during the war. \"We were working in an opposition-controlled area which was often targeted by government forces,\" she says.\"The government forces use a form of shelling called drumming, which is where they fill large metal drums with any type of metal they can find, which they drop over the area, and it then explodes in the air or on land. The shrapnel flies everywhere, and they really put anything they can find in those drums. Once I even saw a man with a pair of pliers sticking out of him.\"She also regularly sees gunshot wounds from Kalashnikovs and AK-47s, as well as injuries from mortar fire.It is civilians that she sees most, who are affected by the fighting.\"In one mass casualty, 50 people came in at once. A 13-year-old girl died.\"In addition to the war injuries, the high levels of stress means that many more people suffer from heart attacks and anxiety attacks.Many people also come in with burn wounds, because they are making fires out of wood for the first time in their lives, and for motor vehicle injuries, as people panic on the roads when they see a helicopter overhead.Women bear the brunt\n\u200bShe says it is the women who bear the brunt of the war.\"I really felt for the women \u2013 the men go off and fight but the women are left behind and have to fight to survive and to feed their families. It is difficult to get food or fuel, especially when it is snowing. Lots of them used to farm, but the farms have been destroyed by the bombs. They see helicopters flying over head and they don't know where it's going to drop a bomb, or which way the wind will blow the shell.\"She says that many women end up nursing their own family members and even have to carry out amputations. Many have babies at home because they are afraid of going to state hospitals, for fear that their babies will be killed.Naidoo is also very passionate about the children of Syria. \"When I see children come into the hospital, I get angry,\" she says.\"One day that stands out for me is seeing a truckload of rebel fighters driving down the road, and they were singing and shouting with their Kalashnikovs in the air. Behind them was a stream of children with wooden guns, running after them and cheering them on. It struck me how abnormal that is, but this is what is normal for these four and five-year-olds, who are used to the bombing and shelling. That wasn't my childhood. Kids shouldn't be involved in a war, but they are and there is nothing we can do to protect them.\"This type of trauma naturally has its effect on the doctors involved in saving lives.\"Part of the process of dealing with the experience is this, drawing attention to what's happening,\" Naidoo says.\"We can't stop the war, but access to health is a basic human right. We debriefed all the time \u2013 during the mission and after.\"In spite of everything, the Syrian people we worked with were really wonderful people. Even though they are struggling to survive, every other night they would invite us over for supper. They were so grateful that we were there, and the experience was so worth it because there is no one else there for them.\"Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(Misha Japaridze, AP)A diplomatic source said he would also see Iran's foreign minister.Russia and Iran have been the staunchest allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout an armed uprising against his rule, and any understandings they might reach with Assad's foes could help overcome the two sides' refusal to negotiate.At an annual international security conference in Munich, Syrian National Coalition leader Moaz Alkhatib had talks with Russia's Sergei Lavrov that may have been made possible by Alkhatib signalling readiness to talk to Damascus.He also met separately with US Vice President Joe Biden and United Nations (UN) special envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi.\"Russia has a certain vision but we welcome negotiations to alleviate the crisis and there are lots of details that need to be discussed,\" Alkhatib said after the meeting.A diplomatic source said the Alkhatib would also meet Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, who was attending the Munich security conference on Saturday, but this could not be independently confirmed.Russia has blocked three UN Security Council resolutions aimed at pushing out Assad out or pressuring him to end the civil war, in which more than 60 000 people have died.But Moscow has also tried to distance itself from Assad by saying it is not trying to prop him up and will not offer him asylum.\"The talks about Syria are intensifying and the Iranians have been drawn in. Let's see how it all ends,\" the diplomatic source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Big signalAlkhatib put his authority within the opposition movement at risk earlier this week when he broke ranks to say he would be willing to meet Syrian officials to discuss a transition if political prisoners arrested during the uprising were freed.The opposition coalition's 12-member politburo then told Alkhatib not to respond to any proposals made in Munich without consulting with them first, with one opposition source citing concern that Alkhatib's move would damage the revolt's morale.Outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Alkhatib's apparent readiness to meet Assad envoys outside Syria, calling him \"not only courageous but smart\".She also voiced concern that Iran had recently increased military support for Assad.While some headway was apparently being made in Munich, Iranian media said that Saeed Jalili of Iran's Supreme National Security Council had travelled to Damascus to meet officials and help Assad \"stand against plots hatched by global arrogance\" \u2013 an allusion to the United States and other Western powers.A comment by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev this week that Assad's chances of staying in power were getting \"smaller and smaller\" was regarded in some quarters as a sign of a shift in the Kremlin's Syria policy.At the same time, Syrian opposition figure Hassan Bali, in Munich as an independent observer, called Alkhatib's meeting with Biden \"a big signal from the Americans\" that they were upgrading support for rebels fighting to topple Assad.Biden said in Munich that although there was still no international agreement, nobody could doubt \"the increasingly desperate plight of the Syrian people and the responsibility of the international community to address that plight\".There was little evidence at the Munich conference that the U.S.\nand Russian positions on Assad were getting any closer.\"The persistence of those who say that priority number one is the removal of Assad is the single biggest reason for the continuing tragedy in Syria,\" Lavrov told the conference.Biden on the other hand said the White House was \"convinced that President Assad, a tyrant hell-bent on clinging to power, is no longer fit to lead Syrian people and he must go\".Russia is Assad's main arms supplier and, with Iran, has been among his strongest supporters during the 22-month-old conflict, which began with peaceful protests and evolved into civil war after Assad tried to crush unrest by military force. \u2013 Reuters.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(AFP)\nThe man who helped bring independence to East Timor saw a dangerous mix in Syria, saying the rebels lacked democratic credentials and President Bashar al-Assad was determined to fight for the survival of himself and his community.\n\"It is becoming a vicious civil war involving many \u2013 too many \u2013 outside interests, governments and non-state interests,\" Ramos-Horta said on a visit to the US.\n\"We are going to see a prolonged civil war, almost a Somalisation of Syria, but in a much more dangerous region of the world. Unfortunately I cannot see a better scenario,\" he said.\nSomalia has been bereft of a central government and torn by fighting for two decades.\nRamos-Horta said another parallel to Syria was the Iran-Iraq War, with the 1980-1988 war leaving more than one million dead and ending \"only when both sides were exhausted\".\nRamos-Horta, who has been active on international peace initiatives, said the US and European nations were right to treat Syria's opposition cautiously. But he said it was \"too simplistic\" to pin blame on Russia and China, which have blocked Western-led UN bids to pressure Assad.\nAssad has ample firepower and there is \"no incentive for the regime to back down\" after witnessing the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and the prosecution of Egypt's deposed president Hosni Mubarak, he said.\nChance for change\nRamos-Horta said that the only chance for change in Syria would come from the military, calling it instrumental in pushing out strongmen such as Mubarak and Suharto in Indonesia as well as allowing recent reforms in Myanmar.\n\"I was hoping that in Syria, countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the others, instead of adding fuel to the fire, were to make a greater effort to entice the military to do the honourable thing \u2013 and that is to tell Assad time to go,\" Ramos-Horta said.\nThe Sunni monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been widely reported to be providing weapons to Syria's rebels at the forefront of an initially peaceful push to end the four-decade rule of the Assad family, which hails from the heterodox Alawite community.\nPresident Barack Obama's administration has urged Assad to step down but said that it is only offering non-lethal assistance to the rebels, despite calls by some members of the rival Republican Party to arm the opposition.\nRamos-Horta voiced concern over revenge attacks on Alawites, saying that centrists in the opposition \"will be cast aside, eaten up, swallowed by the revolution, even considered to be traitors for trying to pursue a prudent and moderate path.\"\n\"Unfortunately, not everybody thinks like the Indonesians or like us ... that we have the ability of letting bygones be bygones,\" he said.\nDozens of attacks\nSyrian air force planes on Monday launched dozens of attacks from Damascus to Aleppo as the truce declared for the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday ended as it began \u2013 in violence.\nOpposition activists reported 48 air strikes in a few hours while the UN and Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, admitted that the four-day ceasefire had failed. \"The situation is bad and getting worse,\" he told reporters in Moscow after talks with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Russia is Syria's closest and most supportive ally at the UN.\nAir raids were reported overnight from the Damascus suburbs of Qaboun, Zamalka and Irbin and described by residents as the heaviest since planes and helicopters first bombarded pro-opposition parts of the Syrian capital in August.\nIn Jermana, near Damascus, a car bomb killed 11 people, including women and children, and injured 50 others, Syrian state media reported, blaming \"terrorists\" for deliberately breaching the truce.\nFighting was also reported from Homs, Idlib and Deir al-Zour on the Iraqi border.\nThe truce, for Eid al-Adha, the Muslim feast of the sacrifice which marks the end of the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, began on Friday morning. An estimated 400 people have died during it. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 110 people were killed on Sunday alone. Of those, 39 were civilians, 34 armed opposition fighters and 35 members of the state security forces, said the UK-based group.\nWarring parties\nShelling and car bombings resumed hours after the ceasefire had been due to take effect on Friday, with each side blaming the other for breaking it.\nIts chances seemed poor from the start in the absence of enthusiasm from the warring parties or any independent mechanism for monitoring and enforcement.\nBrahimi, the veteran Algerian diplomat who succeeded Kofi Annan as the international Syria envoy in September, said he was continuing his mission despite the grim situation. \"I have said and it bears repeating again and again that the Syrian crisis is very, very dangerous, the situation is bad and getting worse. If it's not a civil war, I don't know what it is.\"\nBrahimi is to go to the UN Security Council in November with new proposals to push for talks between al-Assad and the opposition. He is also due to visit China on Tuesday. Beijing has followed Moscow in blocking any action against Syria at the UN.\nBrahimi had hoped that the Eid truce might lead to a longer-term ceasefire and pave the way for a political solution of the conflict that has claimed 35\u00a0000 lives, according to opposition groups.\nIts failure points to the determination of the regime to continue its security strategy and to what many see as the dangerous fragmentation of the anti-Assad forces. \"It's not just about the Syrian military and the army defectors who form the backbone of the Free Syrian Army rebel group anymore,\" said Hassan Abdul-Azim, of the Damascus-based National Co-ordination Bureau. He told reporters that there were so many foreign fighters and other external factors involved in Syria that only an agreement among international and regional powers could end 19 months of fighting.\n'Political process'\nLavrov said Moscow was also \"disappointed\" that the ceasefire was not respected but said there was no point disputing who breached it. He emphasised Russia's position that the crisis will be resolved once western powers and neighbouring countries such as Turkey start negotiating with Assad, not just the opposition. \"Hardly anything will be accomplished without dialogue with the [Syrian] government, and that is the only problem that remains in the path towards a political process,\" he said.\nMoscow has repeatedly criticised western powers for what it says are obstructions of peace efforts in Syria. Last week it alleged the US was co-ordinating arms deliveries to the rebels, which the state department has called \"ludicrous\".\nBan Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" that the fighting had not stopped. \"This crisis cannot be solved with more weapons and bloodshed. The guns must fall silent.\"\nSyrian opposition figures, including FSA commanders, started three days of talks in Istanbul on Monday in the latest attempt to unite disparate groups.\nIn a separate development, the Turkish military fired back after a shell from Syria landed near the village of Besaslan in the southern province of Hatay, state media said, amid clashes between Syrian soldiers and rebels in the nearby border town of Harim. Five Turks were killed by Syrian fire on October 3. \u2013 \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2012, Sapa, AFPGet the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

You\u2019re sure he\u2019s dead?\u201dSeven years had passed with no news, but Salwa could hardly believe her nephew, a Syrian activist arrested in 2011, had been dead in the last five years.The civil records employee shuffling through papers at her desk said: \u201cYes, we received the names of everyone who died inside prison.\u201dTens of thousands of people are estimated to be held in regime jails across Syria, with relatives and advocates saying they are often tortured, denied fair trial, and deprived contact with families.Their relatives are left in limbo, spending years and precious savings shuttling between security services to know where loved ones are held or if they are even alive.A growing number of families, in different areas in Syria, are being informed of the death of their children in the prisons of the Syrian regime through mere coincidence. One would be issuing some formal paper work to discover that his detained son or brother in state prison, is registered dead under the civil registry.As words started to spread, people started to flood the state civil departments to check for a detained relative status in the official registry with queues backing up for hours.Bashar Al Assad last month ordered prisons and detaining centers to update their registries, but people never expected that death certificates would not reach them, and that they would have to find out by coincidence.Now, activists and families of imprisoned Syrians say the regime has quietly updated civil records to mark detainees as \u201cdeceased\u201d, backdating deaths to as long ago as 2013.The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) estimates 80,000 Syrians were \u2018made to disappear\u2019 by the regime.\u201cBefore, the regime would give no details on the detained. It wouldn\u2019t declare them dead,\u201d head of the Syrian Network for Human Rights Abdul Gani told AFP. \u201cNow it is, but in a barbaric way.\u201dThe city of Hama\u2019s records were updated first, followed by Homs, the capital Damascus, Latakia and Hasakeh, and new names are still arriving at registries, the SNHR said.In seven years of documenting Syria\u2019s uprising-turned-war, Abdul Gani said he had never before seen families learn of the fate of the detainees in this way. \u201cUsually, you take a death certificate to the registry and inform them your relative is dead, not the other way around,\u201d he said.Death certificates were sent from the Ministry of Interior to the Civil Registry Department and then to the Civil Registry chapters in different cities.\u00a0The certificates came mainly from Darayya, Ma\u2019damiyeh and Hama prisons.\u00a0 Death certificates were issued by the military hospitals. The cause stated was \u201cdeath from contagious and infectious diseases.\u201d Many former prisoners said fractures and open wounds caused by brutal torture sessions led to infectious diseases and death.Other death certificates stated: \u201cOn the basis of the decision of the First and Second Field Courts.\u201d This meant they were executed after a the ruling by the Field Court.Salwa and her sister-in-law worried they\u2019d be the only people at the registry asking about imprisoned relatives. \u201cBut when we got there, we saw a line out the door,\u201d she said.\u201cMost were women, mothers and sisters of detainees. Security forces stood among them, and every single woman was wiping her tears and covering her face with her scarf.\u201dWeeping, Salwa went home to hold a single day of hushed condolences for two nephews: Sa\u2019ad, arrested in 2011 and marked deceased in 2013, and Saeed, detained since 2012 and recorded to have died last year.The family had no bodies to bury and was afraid of grieving publicly in a regime-held city.\u201cThey scorched our hearts \u2014 those two boys were like roses. Even in mourning, we\u2019re afraid and hide our grief,\u201d Salwa said.The last time Islam Dabbas\u2019s family saw him was late 2012, behind bars at a regime prison near Damascus.\u201cWe stopped hearing anything a while after that,\u201d recalled his brother Abdul Rahman, who has since moved to Egypt.This month, a relative still in Syria learnt of the updated files and checked Islam\u2019s.\u201cIt said he died on January 15, 2013 in Saydnaya,\u201d Abdul Rahman said.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a relief. My mother told me, \u2018He\u2019s lucky. He\u2019s at peace,\u2019\u201d Abdul Rahman said.They held condolences for Islam last week in Egypt, hundreds of kilometers from home and without a body.But confirming what many long suspected is not enough, said Noura Gazi, a Syrian lawyer and member of the detainee advocacy group Families for Freedom. \u201cOK, you\u2019ve told us they\u2019re dead, but we want to know where the bodies are. We want to know the real way they died,\u201d Gazi said. Others are hesitating.\u201cPeople are so tired. Of course, there\u2019s denial. Others are suspicious, saying \u2018Why would we believe this document is real? Or this date to be true?\u2019\u201d said Gazi, who lives in Beirut.Her husband, activist Bassel Khartabil, vanished after his October 3, 2015 arrest. In 2017, through her networks, Gazi confirmed he died in regime detention.\u201cI held condolences for him, I wore black. I thought I had processed the truth,\u201d she said.That changed when a relative of Khartabil visited a Damascus registry in early July and saw the regime\u2019s freshly-recorded date of death: October 5, 2015.\u201cWhen we saw that, it\u2019s like he died all over again,\u201d said Gazi.\u201cThere\u2019s no going back. For more than two years I fought to know his fate. Now I\u2019ll be fighting my whole life to get his body.\u201dThe heaviest price paid in civil wars was by families, who live in limbo for years and years, looking for answers to the fate of their beloved, detained, kidnapped, or dead- With inputs from AFPMax - 36 \u00b0CMin - 17 \u00b0CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

It also happens to define both, former United States president Barack Obama\u2019s and current President Donald Trump\u2019s approaches to working with Russia on the Syrian civil war. Washington and Moscow have repeatedly issued joint statements outlining principles for addressing the conflict and reducing its horrific humanitarian consequences. Yet, over and over again, the Russians have betrayed their commitments.Consider the record. In November 2015, the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reached an agreement on the Vienna principles. They called for a cessation of hostilities; lifting the sieges on all cities; the unimpeded provision of food, medicine and other humanitarian materials; the drafting of a constitution in six months; and a political transition process of 18 months. In December 2015, these principles were enshrined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254. Syrian President Bashar Al Assad\u2019s regime blatantly violated all of the terms: It lifted no sieges and did not allow humanitarian relief to pass unimpeded.The Russians, too, did nothing. Although Al Assad and the Russians did finally implement a ceasefire two months later, it collapsed by April 2016 as the Al Assad regime resumed its onslaught against civilian targets, with a special emphasis on hospitals. Much as in his use of chemical weapons, Al Assad hit hospitals to show that he would respect no limits. Kerry was reduced to condemning Al Assad\u2019s attacks while plaintively appealing to Moscow to act on the responsibility enshrined in the December 2015 resolution. \u201cWe all signed the same agreement and we all supported the same UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for a nationwide cessation of hostilities,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit calls for a nationwide, full delivery of humanitarian assistance within all of Syria\u201d.Clear words, but no consequences. Not surprisingly, Kerry\u2019s calls were in vain. By the autumn of 2016 he tried again, reaching an agreement on a joint operations centre with the Russians in the hope of reducing the violence and making a political process possible. Once again he was frustrated, declaring that he had \u201cprofound doubt about whether Russia and the Al Assad regime can or will live up to the obligations that they agreed to in Geneva\u201d. The Russian response was to launch a scorched-earth attack on Aleppo, which reduced the eastern half of the city \u2014 then Syria\u2019s largest \u2014 to rubble. That ended Kerry\u2019s efforts.Trump has made his own attempts to get somewhere with the Russians. On the margins of the Group of 20 summit in Germany in July 2017, he and Putin finalised a ceasefire agreement for southwestern Syria. Trump met again with Putin in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, where they issued another joint statement on Syria. It emphasised the \u201cimportance of de-escalation areas as an interim step to reduce violence in Syria, enforce ceasefire agreements, facilitate unhindered humanitarian access, and set the conditions for the ultimate political solution to the conflict\u201d on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.So how did the Russians act after that? Along with the Al Assad regime and the Iranians, they waged military campaigns that decimated and depopulated three of the four de-escalation areas. The fourth, the one Trump and Putin had agreed to in southwestern Syria, remained quiet \u2014 effectively freeing the Al Assad regime, with its Russian backers, to attack elsewhere.Lately, Al Assad and the Russians have turned their attention to southwestern Syria, bombing relentlessly. On June 21, the US State Department issued a blunt statement warning the Al Assad regime and the Russian government about \u201cserious repercussions of these violations\u201d. The Russians intensified their bombing, creating a new refugee flow with more than 270,000 people fleeing to the Jordanian and Israeli borders. Did Moscow face any \u201cserious repercussions\u201d? No \u2014 only Trump\u2019s pursuit of a summit with Putin.Neither Obama nor Trump has been prepared to impose any consequences on the Russians. Both wanted to get out of Syria, not to be embroiled in it. And both permitted Putin to become the arbiter of events. So what should Trump do when he and Putin meet in Helsinki on July 16?He should make a virtue of necessity and convey the following points: That the US will maintain its small presence in Syria until Daesh is gone; that unless Iran\u2019s continuing entrenchment in Syria is contained, it will trigger a wider war between Israel and the Iranians; and that the US will back the Israelis completely, making it in Putin\u2019s interest to stop the expansion of the Iranians and their proxies in Syria and prevent a major regional escalation. Trump may even suggest that the Russians broker a set of red lines between the Israelis and Iranians in Syria.Indeed, Trump could also ask Putin to be his channel to the Iranians. Apart from limiting the potential for miscalculation with Tehran, it could give Putin a stake in coordinating with America on Iran. With the US having already conceded Syria to Russia, history tells us that America is unlikely to achieve more.\u2014 Washington PostDennis Ross, a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute, served in senior national security positions in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

The \u2018victory\u2019, however, came at an enormous cost.While the international community typically steps up to provide reconstruction support when civil wars end, it has been reluctant to do so in Syria.\u201cA number of Western states have been appalled at the way Al Assad has prosecuted this war,\u201d Tamara Coffman Wittes, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution said in a recent podcast, pointing to his \u201cwillingness to ravage the entire country, displace half of the population, destroy civilian infrastructure and engage in massive war crimes, including the use of chemical weapons.\u201dWhat started out in 2011 as a pro-democracy uprising against the Syrian regime\u2014which had been in power for more than 40 years\u2014quickly spiraled into a conflict which has been described the United Nations as the \u2018greatest humanitarian catastrophe in modern times\u2019.The repression of protests quickly turned violent as protesters were shot, arrested and tortured.Hundreds of deaths, turned into thousands. Entire neighbourhoods were flattened as protests mushroomed across the country at lightning speed.Then came sieges, starvation, barrel bombs, and chemical weapons.Desperate Syrian families threw their children into rubber dinghies and crossed the Mediterranean in order to reach Europe where they hoped they could secure a better future for their children\u2014many drowned.International players joined the fight with each country investing in their own personal agendas which further complicated the conflict.This of course played to Al Assad\u2019s advantage. He positioned himself as a bulwark against chaos and terrorism.Iran quickly jumped in to support him through its proxy militias, most importantly the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah. Migrants make their way on foot on the outskirts of Brezice, Slovenia October 20, 2015. Slovenia's interior ministry raised the possibility on Tuesday of setting up physical barriers along its southeastern border if the numbers of migrants increased. Reuters\u00a0While it helped him in the short-term it was not enough to sustain his war efforts. At one point Al Assad\u2019s grip on territory shrunk to only Damascus and his bastion on the Mediterranean, Latakia\u2014it looked the his end was approaching.However, the tables turned in 2015 when Russia stepped into the fray\u2014sending war planes and soldiers to hand Al Assad a decisive victory.Since then, the emboldened Syrian president has shown little interest in a politically negotiated solution to end the conflict\u2014which killed more than a half a million people.Speaking to Gulf News, non-resident senior fellow at Brookings, Steven Heydemann, says he is doubtful Western states will be involved in the reconstruction process.\u201cWestern governments have shown impressive commitment to the principle of no funding without a meaningful, inclusive political transition. While some countries in Asia could be willing to provide support in exchange for economic benefits, there is no appetite in the West, at the moment for reconstruction.\u201dBut Al Assad\u2019s international backers will sure to be rewarded by the Syrian regime for their support in what Heydemann describes as a \u201cclear quid-pro-quo system\u201d.Already some Russian firms have been handed contracts to rebuild lucrative oil fields damaged in the war\u2014Iranian and Chinese firms have been handed reconstruction contracts as well.\u201cGiven how much Iran thinks its worth to have Al Assad in power, one would imagine that they have incentive to continue to entrench him through reconstruction,\u201d Wittes says. A bulldozer removing rubble from war damage in the Lairamoun district of the Syrian city of Aleppo, among the most heavily destroyed urban areas in the seven-year civil war. AP\u201cAlso, its good business. Let\u2019s not forget the scale of destruction is so vast\u2014entire city blocks have been reduced to rubble. There is a lot of money to be made in rebuilding Syria,\u201d she adds.Given the amount of money Russia and Iran invested in keeping Al Assad in power, rebuilding offers them a chance to recoup some of the profits from their investment, Wittes explains.However, the scale of destruction is so massive that such help will barely scratch the surface of the cost to rebuild which has been estimated to be between $100 to $300 billion. Al Assad, however, doesn\u2019t seem to care.\u201cHe wants to control every aspect of reconstruction, even if that means he will not receive all the assistance he needs to do so,\u201d Heydemann says.He cited new laws being passed by the regime, such as Law 10, which aims at re-organising and re-defining private and public real estate in Syria, especially in war-effected areas.In rebel Syria, a race to save precious property deedsThe law, which is yet to go into effect, gives owners a 30-day grace period to prove that they own a plot of land or home, by providing property documents either by showing up in person or through relatives up to the fourth degree.Those who fail to do so suffer the confiscation of their property and either its transferred into government hands or old at public auction.\u201cThere is a campaign underway by the regime to purchase properties from those it views as insufficiently loyal to the regime and to make those properties available to regime loyalists,\u201d Heydemann said, predicting large scale demographic changes in the future.Another law being discussed would control which NGOs would be involved in the reconstruction process. Mohammed Bayraqdar sits with his son Abdul-Awal aon the staircase of their burned-out house in Khaldiyeh, one of the worst damaged neighborhoods in the Syrian city of Homs. APAll of this, Heydemann says, proves that the regime is not sincere its commitment to reconstruction but rather \u201cis using the process as a way to solidify its control in the country\u201d.\u201cAl Assad\u2019s goal is to use reconstruction to create what he calls a \u2018healthier and more homogenous society\u2019 with the intent to prevent the return of refugees,\u201d Heydemann tells Gulf News.The Syrian president could be banking on the notion on the European fear that if it does not help out with the reconstruction, refugees living there will have little incentive to return home.Wittes describes it as a \u201cchicken and the egg\u201d scenario, where the West believes Al Assad\u2019s exclusionary and repressive policies are the direct cause of radicalism and the proliferation of refugees.\u201cThe West is saying if you don\u2019t fix yourself and reform with more inclusive political and economic structures, you will foment chaos and we don\u2019t want to invest in that. But the regime is saying, \u2018either help us or you will suffer with outflows of radicals and refugees\u2019,\u201d he says.It remains to be seen whether international players will buy into the argument. Wittes believes it will come down to who feels the pain first and who gives in.\u201cUsually the internationally community steps in to rebuild after a civil war as a way to solidify peace and prevent the relapse of conflict and to create conditions which refugees could return home, but in Syria it fears such a move would solidify Al Assad\u2019s rule over the wreck that is Syria,\u201d Wittes says.\u201cThere is a concern that if support were to be provided to the Al Assad regime in the moment when he has achieved a decisive military victory over his opponents that he would take that as a signal to reimpose his authority and rebuild institutions even more repressive and exclusionary than before,\u201d Heydemann says.Wittes agrees and says the case of Iraq should be studied as a cautionary tale.\u201cFrom 2011 to 2014, US President Barack Obama was reducing US funds and presence in the country at a time where a very fragile sectarian agreement was holding Iraq together. Instead of constraining Iraqi premier Nouri Al Maliki from his sectarian policies, we leaned backed. This created the conditions for Daesh to emerge and US troops had to return to Iraq to fight the terrorist group,\u201d she said.Wittes believes political reconciliation and inclusion is far more important than reconstruction.\u201cWithout this, Syria\u2019s Sunni population will inevitably turn to extremist groups for protection.\u201dShe says that Al Assad may have won the war, but he\u2019s setting the ground for the next round of conflict by creating the conditions for a backlash.Heydemann agrees adding that he is doubtful the Syrian regime will learn its lesson from what happened in Iraq.\u201cReconstruction is not just about removing rubble. Its about knitting back together a society that has become deeply polarised.\u201dIn the Syrian city of Homs\u2019 landmark Clock Square, where some of the first anti-government protests erupted in 2011, stands a giant poster of a smiling President Bashar Al Assad waving his right arm, with a caption that reads: \u201cTogether we will rebuild.\u201dFour years after the military brought most of the city back under Al Assad\u2019s control, the government launched its first big reconstruction effort in Homs earlier this year, planning to erect hundreds of apartment buildings in three neighbourhoods in the devastated center of the city.It is a small start to the massive task of rebuilding Syria, where seven years of war, air strikes and barrel bombs have left entire cities and infrastructure a landscape of rubble.The government estimates reconstruction will cost some $200 billion dollars and last 15 years.Government workers have also begun clearing rubble from Daraya, one of the many Damascus suburbs wrecked by a long siege, to begin reconstruction.The government can cover $8 billion to $13 billion of the reconstruction costs, according to the Cabinet\u2019s economic adviser, Abdul Qadir Azzouz.Recent Associated Press drone footage from Daraya outside Damascus and the city of Aleppo in the north shows scenes of destruction reminiscent of World War II devastation.East Aleppo, home to nearly 1.5 million before the war, is still largely empty and in ruins a year after it was recaptured from rebels.Small-scale renovation of government buildings and historical sites has barely begun to scratch the surface.In eastern Ghouta \u2014 an area with a pre-war population of some 400,000 \u2014 the United Nations did an assessment of satellite imagery from six of its seven districts and found more than 6,600 damaged buildings, more than 1,100 of which were totally destroyed. And that was before the latest government offensive, which has leveled even more homes and structures.For reconstruction overall, the Syrian government is trying to scrape together financing from Syrian businessmen and expatriates as well as international allies.It has also imposed a 0.5 percent reconstruction tax on some items, including restaurant bills.The Homs project gives an indication of the scale of the task.The plan focuses on three of the city\u2019s most destroyed districts \u2014 Baba Amr, Sultanieh and Jobar \u2014 and will rebuild 465 buildings, able to house 75,000 people, at a cost of $4 billion, according to Homs\u2019 governor, Talal Al Barrazi.It was not immediately clear how many housing units that entails \u2014 meaning individual apartments \u2014 but assuming there is on average five people per household, that would be around 15,000 units.That\u2019s under half of the 35,000 housing units that were estimated to have been destroyed in Homs.And it\u2019s a small fraction of the 1 million housing units Al Barrazi said Syria will need.Homs saw some of the worst destruction of the war as government forces for months blasted the string of neighbourhoods in the city\u2019s center that were held by rebels.For the past four years, any rebuilding has largely been the work of individuals, with some help from the UN.In the devastated Khaldiyeh district, carpenters were fixing the windows and doors of Mohammad Bayraqdar\u2019s charred apartment.The walls inside \u2014 even the chandeliers \u2014 were still blackened from the fighting years ago.The 38-year-old coffee vendor fled Khaldiyeh in 2011 and moved to his in-laws in a government-controlled part of the city.Late last year he informed the municipality that he wanted to return home.Once government architects checked that the building was suitable for living, repair work began with the help of a UN rebuilding programme.\u201cEveryone should return to his home, even if it means living in one room only,\u201d said Bayraqdar, standing on the roof overlooking a vista of flattened buildings.Outside Damascus, Daraya was left an empty ruin after all its population was removed in a deal last year that ended a destructive and grueling siege by Al Assad\u2019s military.The suburb once had a population of 300,000 and was famous for its furniture, textiles, wood and vineyards, which produced some of Syria\u2019s best grapes.\u201cAlmost all houses, factories, stores in Daraya remain skeletons,\u201d said Daraya\u2019s mayor, Marwan Obeid.He estimated rebuilding infrastructure alone will cost $160 million to $200 million. The government has so far allocated $70 million.The plan, he said, is to start moving some 100,000 people back into the less damaged half of Daraya.The rest of the community, however, is too ruined. Obeid said it was not known how long that will take to rebuild.-APMax - 36 \u00b0CMin - 17 \u00b0CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Russia had again blocked a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Syria before it later relented and the truce resolution was passed late on Saturday. Since the war began in 2011, Russia has vetoed 11 draft resolutions. Last week, it did not even need to veto, only to make clear that it would if the sponsors pushed their draft to a vote.As a permanent member of the security council, Russia has a special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Instead, in New York it has protected Al Assad against the consequences of his actions, including the use of chemical weapons; inside Syria, its forces have actively participated in attacks on hospitals and other prima facie war crimes. These atrocities have been well-documented.The response of western countries to the horrors in Syria is always the same: more statements deploring and condemning what has happened and appeals for an end to the violence. In the first two years of the conflict, the EU averaged almost one statement a week. The statements have become less frequent but no more effective. As the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussain, said recently: \u201cThe conduct and management of this war has been utterly shameful from the outset and the failure to end it marks an epic failure of global diplomacy.\u201dAfter seven years, it would be easy to conclude that there is nothing we can do, or that \u2014 in the words of Yes, Prime Minister\u2019s Sir Humphrey Appleby \u2014 \u201cmaybe there was something we could have done, but it\u2019s too late now\u201d. Western countries could simply accept that the slaughter will go on until the vastly superior forces of Syria, Iran and Russia have wiped out or driven away all their enemies. But doing nothing in the face of massacres would not absolve the West of a share of responsibility for the bloodshed, any more than it did in Rwanda or Bosnia.Risk of destabilisationWestern leaders must also think about the impact on their own interests if the Syrian regime and its allies achieve victory and the only \u201cpolitical solution\u201d in Syria is the reimposition of Al Assad\u2019s autocratic rule throughout the country. Syria is not hermetically sealed from its neighbours or from Europe. There are already 5.5 million refugees outside Syria\u2019s borders and more than 6 million internally displaced. Despite the aid the EU, the UK and other donors have given to support them, they will not be grateful to countries that would not tackle the source of their suffering. They will be ripe for exploitation by extremists and the countries that host the largest numbers \u2014 Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey \u2014 will be at risk of destabilisation.At a minimum, the West should do more to end the impunity of Syria\u2019s leaders and their allies. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in December 2016 setting up a panel to assist in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for war crimes in Syria. Countries such as the UK that have laws allowing prosecutions for war crimes committed in other countries should work with the panel to open cases as soon as possible.If there is evidence to implicate Iranian or Russian forces in serious violations of international humanitarian law, then they also should be targeted for prosecution. Those most responsible for the suffering of the Syrian people over the last seven years should spend the rest of their lives looking over their shoulders.In addition, the EU and like-minded countries should step up sanctions against Russian individuals and companies involved in supporting the conflict in Syria.Many may already be sanctioned in connection with Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, but the EU should increase the pressure with asset freezes, travel bans and restrictions on EU firms doing business with Russian entities active in Syria.After failed interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, western politicians understandably do not want to talk to their voters about military action in Syria. Russia\u2019s involvement is an added complication: no one wants to stumble into world war three, especially when many of those still fighting are the kind of violent extremists that western governments are combating at home. But when politicians say that there is no military solution in Syria, they are lying: there is a military solution and Al Assad, Khamenei and Putin are imposing it. The West can either try to stop them or wait until peace comes to Syria when Al Assad and Putin run out of people to kill.\u2014 Guardian News & Media LtdIan Bond is the director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedPakistan\u2019s resilience is its strengthUS should watch out for the enemy withinAncient Syria river sections off modern warChomsky: Israel\u2019s support erodes in AmericaFor balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Al Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in ...Trump\u2019s admission that he has taken occupied Jerusalem ...Holiday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

To the international community, however, it\u2019s a civil war. The United Nations, western governments, media and European Union all refer to the Syrian conflict this way. In December 2015, United States Secretary of State John Kerry emphasised the need to \u201cend the nation\u2019s civil war\u201d. In September this year, the New York Times published a long explainer on the conflict, answering, among other questions, \u2018What is the Syrian civil war?\u2019These simplifications are inaccurate and dangerous. They absolve the international community of responsibility and give Syrian President Bashar Al Assad a veneer of legitimacy. They liberate Russia and Iran \u2014 actively involved with troops in the conflict \u2014 from culpability. And they allow internal terrorist groups to justify their involvement and violence.There is no doubt that civil war is one of the many layers of the Syrian conflict. Local factions are fighting each other. In truth though, this is a war on the people of Syria, carried out by the Al Assad regime and his allies.We see that in the violence. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, Al Assad\u2019s forces have killed 95 per cent of Syrian victims. Additionally, Al Assad controls the army, including tanks, planes and barrel bombs. He has shelled areas that witnessed peaceful protests. He has used chemical weapons against his own people. He controls the intelligence, security and military apparatus that have diligently and systematically worked since 2011 to arrest, torture and kill all nonviolent activists.Al Assad also released dangerous extremist inmates from prison and allowed them to organise and build armed groups. He did this not by accident, but as part of a strategy to create a civil war and radicalise what remained of the revolution. His strategy has been to shift the narrative from reform to sectarianism by emphasising terrorism, thereby presenting himself as a partner in the global war on terror.It\u2019s also hard to square the civil war claim with the vast amount of external interference. Faced with a strong resistance from the armed opposition groups, Al Assad has allowed both Iran and Russia to help him and his regime survive. In fact, Al Assad\u2019s army is barely fighting today. The fighting force on the ground is mostly Shiite militias, with some Syrian Arab Army battalions \u2014 all reporting to Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and aided by Russian air bombing. Without Iran and Russia, Al Assad would have been long gone.How can we call this conflict a civil war when the Syrian opposition is rarely fighting Syrian loyalists and instead battling with foreign fighters in its own country? Is it a civil war when all of Russia, Iran, the United States and other assorted Nato nations are involved in one way or another?Calling it a civil war has serious implications on policy. It protects Al Assad. He may be an obnoxious dictator, the logic goes, but a stabilising one. It also gives the impression that this is an internal conflict, allowing western powers and international organisations not to take sides. As a result of this inaction, the world witnessed the exodus of Syrian refugees, the scuttling of US efforts by Russia and Iran and terrorist attacks in European cities.Equating the killer with the victim has a moral challenge that eventually legitimises the regime\u2019s crimes against humanity. It also subdues the modern history of Syria that brought Hafeez Al Assad to power where the Baath Party and eventually the ruling family refused to allow anyone else in Syria to participate in politics. This regime has always resorted to military solutions and has never chosen negotiations over violence. Today, with Iran commanding the battles in Syria and Russia negotiating with the international community on the future of Syria, what is left of the regime is an image that is only needed to preserve other states\u2019 interests.This is not a civil war. Only when we stop calling it a civil war, we might be able to understand the history and strategy of the regime, the various layers of the Syrian people, the interests of those who are already intervening and the significance of accountability.\u2014 Washington PostHanin Ghaddar is the inaugural Friedmann Visiting Fellow at The Washington Institute.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedWhy true journalism will never dieWhy North Korean nukes are still on the tableKerala braces for more heavy showersUS threatens more sanctions on TurkeyFor balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Al Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in ...Trump\u2019s admission that he has taken occupied Jerusalem ...Holiday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Like the events in Libya the bloody confrontation in Syria may develop into a full blown civil war. But unlike Libya, a civil war in Syria fuelled by ethnic conflicts carries with it the distinct possibility of igniting other ethnic conflicts and further destabilising the region.While the revolution in Libya may not have been characterised as a vital interest of the US, the events in Syria clearly can affect Washington\u2019s vital interests in the region.The overriding interest here would be to prevent local conflicts from threatening the traditional American vital interests in the Middle East, namely: Access to strategic resources in the region and the maintenance of a regional military balance of power that is favourable to Israel.It was to defend these interests that Washington went to war against Iraq \u2014twice. Once in 1991 to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait; and again in 2003 to forcibly remove Saddam Hussain from power and end his threats to the Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, on the one hand, and to Israel\u2019s military hegemony in the region, on the other hand. Ironically the neo-cons in the Bush administration, pursuing common goals with Israel, had targeted the Syrian regime as next Arab candidate for regime change, to put an end, once and for all, to all possible Arab challenges to Israeli military domination in the region.Although as a military power Libya pales into insignificance with Nato\u2019s military might, it took Nato months and thousands of air strikes to subdue Libyan military defence, and pave the way for Libyan opposition to take power.But Syria is not Libya, and even on grounds of humanitarian intervention, it would be hard for Washington to find support domestically and internationally for a Libya \u2014 like the bombing campaign against Syria. The most logical reason for opposing such a war against Syria is the difficulty of keeping it localised. Another imponderable would be the reaction of Israel and the temptation to grab more land from Syria.One more reason why the military option against Syria is not viable is the absence of any clear leadership for the pro-democracy movement, or for the opposition.Whatever opposition there is remains rhetorically committed to change but effectively unable to bring it about. In Syria, the question is not whether the opposition is armed or not, the question is: Who are the opposition? And how effective are they as a political force? And are they capable of popular mobilisation to support a programme of democratic reforms and economic revival?It was not until last week that the fragmented Syrian opposition managed to establish a broad-based national council committed to overthrowing President Bashar Al Assad\u2019s government.Obama too wants to overthrow Al Assad\u2019s regime. The question is how? The New York Times reported last month that the Obama administration had decided that the Al Assad regime would not survive the sustained challenge of the protest movement. The administration, the paper reported, had begun to prepare for the post-Al Assad regime.In particular, Washington is concerned about the possibility of a civil war among Syria\u2019s ethnic and religious groups (Alawite, Druze, Christian and Sunni sects) and its potential impact on the region.But Washington may be repeating the mistakes of its unfortunate experience in Iraq. In its obsession with regime change and the forcible removal of Saddam, it failed to develop adequate strategies to prevent the post-Saddam Iraq from descending into violent chaos.What is already clear is that Washington has decided that Al Assad must go. But it is not clear what plans there are, if any, for the post-Al Assad Syria.Obama has called on him to step down and the US is currently discussing \u201chow to help bring it about.\u201dIn other words, the Obama administration is currently discussing how to bring about regime change in Syria in the absence of an open military intervention. Washington has opted for a strategy of punitive economic pressure on the Al Assad regime.Shutting the European market to which Syria exports 90 per cent of its oil exports, could cripple the Syrian economy. But it may not necessarily bring the regime down. Those Syrians already suffering from high unemployment and chronic poverty are already in revolt. The business elites and the middle class were supportive of Al Assad\u2019s liberalisation of the economy, and his capacity to think strategically as evidence by his support for the American war on terror.After the armed uprisings of the Muslim Brothers in Aleppo in 1980 and in Hama in February 1982 were crushed with ruthless brutality, a government general amnesty diffused the threat and fragmented the organisation. The army is infiltrated with Alawite and is a beneficiary of the status quo, although this could change.The irony is that a new political party law ratified by the Syrian parliament last August could have effectively put an end to the one-party system put in place by the Baathists after they seized power in a military coup in 1963. But it did not, proving that an authoritarian regime cannot reform itself.Adel Safty is Distinguished Professor Adjunct at the Siberian Academy of Public Administration, Russia.

No matter how harsh it might sound to western and Arab ears, it has become evident that thanks to Russian support, Al Assad may continue his rule from Damascus. The dictator was able to avoid a total collapse of his regime due to a combination of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s help, the Syria\u2019s national army\u2019s role and the Iranian-funded Hezbollah\u2019s backing. In the meantime, Al Assad has been able to recover most of the lost territories that he now keeps under a tight control. Thanks to the western stubbornness, the United States-funded \u2018Syrian rebel\u2019 force has eventually been reduced to nothing. It will now be part of the political delegations attending meetings in Astana or Geneva, and progressively rallying individuals \u2014 or migrants. Opposition leader Michel Kilo can go on spending good time in his Doha house and Syrian \u2018intellectuals\u2019 may resume their endless debates out of regional five-star palaces or Paris\u2019 cafe terraces.The immeasurable muck-up of the war in Syria is startling. It started with an absurd concept according to which, a dictatorial regime would voluntarily give up all the levels of command that it firmly held, simply because it was required to so by \u2018democratic\u2019 nations. Then, a concentration of ill-inspired decisions transformed the country into a regional battlefield, where every actor was sponsoring some group. The results are there for all to see: Nearly 500,000 casualties, millions of displaced people and migrants, a ruined economy, a sacrificed generation \u2014 while Al Assad continues to rule! Let\u2019s hope some of the world leaders will feel uncomfortable in their conscience regarding what they did \u2014 or let others do \u2014 in Syria.There was a scramble to get rid of a dictatorship, but what should have been the approach is a genuine revolution, which implies a huge majority of the population hitting the streets and taking up arms \u2014 which did not apparently happen in Syria. One ought to understand the similarities as well as the differences between a foreign war that overthrows the existing legal authority \u2014 no need to remind ourselves that the Iraq war didn\u2019t achieve anything significant; a \u2018palace revolution\u2019 \u2014 which fundamentally doesn\u2019t change anything; or the so-called \u2018belly-dancing\u2019 strategy, whereby there is an open policy towards the external world, until the \u2018beast\u2019 realises it is no more in command \u2014 that is what took place in some former Soviet republics during the \u2018orange\u2019 revolutions, and what was actually unfolding in Syria until 2011. Unfortunately, everything will now have to start from a scratch. Seven years have been lost and a whole population deeply wounded.On the European side, French diplomacy proved devastating. To start with, both the assertions were wrong: That the \u201cMuslim Brotherhood are nice guys to work with because they are the representatives of a moderate Islam\u201d, and that \u201cThere is no chance to begin discussions with the Syrian regime until Al Assad is gone\u201d. Seven years later, Al Assad is still there and it is amply clear that the Muslim Brotherhood are not \u201cnice guys\u201d.How will the regional balance of power be affected by this emerging situation?Assuming that most of the rebel forces are on the verge of disappearance \u2014 \u201cThe Syrian Opposition should now look for a logical attitude\u201d, one of their regional financial sponsors recently declared as a confirmation. Yet, a residual resistance pocket remains in Idlib, with Al Nusrah leading the show. Actually, both US and Russia can use that as an excellent pretext to stay on-site \u2014 and on top. It is another hurdle towards the creation of an independent Kurdish territory, Turkey\u2019s permanent nightmare.Elsewhere in Syria, the \u2018non-fighting\u2019 war zones promoted by Russia and accepted by Turkey and the US will develop, while talks in Astana or Geneva will go on \u2014 until there is nobody to attend them! As for the Al Assad regime, it will intensify its all-round opening campaign, as already confirmed by Syrian opponents who are being increasingly courted these days. The launch of reconstruction work will be another consolidating element, despite attempts to correlate the matter with the sought-after \u2018political transition\u2019. The presence of former Syrian planning minister Abdullah Al Dardari as the head of the United Nations Reconstruction Programme for Syria will surely help.As for foreign actors, Turkey will remain concentrated on Kurdistan; the US and Russia, on sharing their influence, fighting terrorism and doing business; Europe \u2014 and especially France \u2014 will be trying to be back into the peace process. This move has finally been initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron, while the other neighbouring countries will probably be concentrating on more vital domestic issues. Al Assad will then be in a position to reinstate a favourite Syrian game \u2014 making Russia and Iran oppose each other, so that he gets more breathing space.In the end, we will still be left with the question that the Syrian people and their children are so rightfully entitled to ask: \u201cWhy did we have to come to such a pass?\u201dLuc Debieuvre is a French essayist and a lecturer at Iris (Institut de Relations Internationales et Strategiques) and the \u2018Faco\u2019 Law University of Paris.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedWhy true journalism will never dieWhy North Korean nukes are still on the tableKerala braces for more heavy showersUS threatens more sanctions on TurkeyFor balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Al Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in ...Trump\u2019s admission that he has taken occupied Jerusalem ...Holiday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Marwa knew it was the call she had longed for through three long years of silence, but when a young man\u2019s voice faltered down the line, she was no longer sure of what she wanted to hear.She felt the heat on her skin as the sunlight of early spring pierced the lace curtains.The uprising back home in Syria had put her family on a collision course with tragedy from day one. Marwa had not chosen her husband\u2019s sacrifices, but her life had been overtaken by them. She was tired, lonely, sometimes angry. She wanted a sign that he still remembered, that he was sorry for how he\u2019d left her. She wanted him back. Theirs was a love story. She was the bold one, 18 years old and happy to be done with school. Omar was older and more solemn, but his smile was infectious. \u201cIt crossed his face so fast that you couldn\u2019t help smiling, too,\u201d Marwa remembered.She had pretended to ignore his glances on the spring day in 2006 when she visited his electronic appliances store in central Damascus. The family had been paying for their refrigerator in instalments, but since it was usually Marwa\u2019s father who stopped by the store, Omar had not been expecting a visit from the young woman who smiled softly as she browsed his shelves without looking up. \u201cI knew he was looking at me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was studying every detail.\u201dWhen Omar plucked up the courage to suggest he pick up payments from the family home, Marwa felt a jolt of excitement in her stomach. She knew her father had no idea what was going on, and when she tiptoed into the living room to serve the men Arabic coffee, her brown eyes met Omar\u2019s for a brief moment.Soon she was calling the store every day, just to hear his voice. \u201cI\u2019d slam the phone down as soon as he picked up in case he realised it was me. But he always knew,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fell in love in 15 days.\u201dThey married soon after, and when Marwa became pregnant with their first son, Omar\u2019s family pitched in to buy them a place in the gray-brick suburb of Daraya. It was barely more than a bedroom, but they were happy in their little refuge high above the traffic and far from the prying eyes of the plainclothes police officers on their street.Outside, the world was changing. Anti-regime protests had spread from Tunisia to Egypt and Libya, and by March 2011, it was Syria\u2019s turn. At times, residents said, it felt as if the whole of Daraya was in the streets, holding flowers aloft and roaring in unison, their chants echoing amid the concrete and the dust.Omar was intoxicated, spending hours on social media as he chatted away and dreamed bigger by the day, Marwa recalled. Demonstrations were rippling through the country, and the protests in Daraya, which they considered the cradle of the revolution, felt electric. Each night he would join the crowds as they marched through the town bellowing \u201cLeave, Bashar!\u201d and \u201cThe men of Syria are not afraid!\u201dMarwa could not share her husband\u2019s dreams. It all felt too fast, too foolish, and President Bashar Al Assad looked in no mood to compromise. Whenever Omar was getting ready to join the crowds, she would beg him not to go and then wait up for his return. She had listened with growing trepidation as Omar and his father argued late into the night, the elder man telling his son that they were playing with fire. The protesters had no plan, no direction. The regime had killed opposition members in the tens of thousands after a rebellion three decades earlier. \u201cThis time it will be worse,\u201d he told Omar.The couple would sometimes be mid-conversation when Omar\u2019s cellphone pinged with messages from friends wanting to talk planning and revolution, she recounted. He nearly always went to them, leaving Marwa alone with their son.By fall, there were tanks outside the town and guns in the crowds. The following September, Al Assad loyalists killed openly in the streets of Daraya as the army pummelled civilian homes with bombs and mortar rounds. Marwa\u2019s anxieties had melted into pure fear, but Omar still wouldn\u2019t leave. His friends were now wanted by the regime, and he said he couldn\u2019t live with himself if he fled. He found a way to smuggle Marwa away, past army lines and checkpoints and into Damascus.Within days, she learned that she was pregnant again.Omar was in hiding. Friends told her that police were searching door-to-door. When they finally spoke, his voice, usually so calm and strong, sounded thin with fear.\u201cHe didn\u2019t know how we could have a baby at a time like this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was scared, but he told me he loved me.\u201d Next-door Lebanon was the safest place for her now, they agreed, but as Marwa\u2019s car pulled out onto the Damascus-Beirut highway one afternoon in early November, she did not foresee a long absence.The regime\u2019s far-reaching crackdown could not avert Syria\u2019s descent into civil war. As more and more people were rounded up, armed opposition groups seemed to multiply by the day.By the time Marwa returned to Damascus for a brief trip to see Omar the following month, the capital already felt different. Conversations were more clipped, and everyone seemed wary. She was window-shopping for baby clothes, she recalled, when a group of men approached Omar in the street. They were wearing civilian clothes, but Marwa didn\u2019t like the way Omar\u2019s whole body seemed to stiffen as the oldest man addressed him. She was at his side in seconds, and his expression read like a silent plea. \u201cIt was like he was telling me to walk away and not tell them I was his wife. They took us both.\u201dIn State Security\u2019s Branch 40, a drab building near a red-roofed Italian hospital, Marwa watched her husband stripped to his underwear and pushed into a battered chair. Questions came thick and fast. They said the protesters were terrorists. What was Omar doing with them? Was he a terrorist? Were his friends terrorists? When the interrogator brought out his tools, Marwa tried to turn away. A guard grabbed her cheeks and forced her head back to face her husband as the men got to work.She remembers only flashes. Omar screaming as they beat his head and stomach with an iron bar. Blood everywhere, but Omar telling them nothing. Her mouth so dry she could barely swallow. Then an officer stepped forward and placed a small, cold knife to her pregnant belly. Omar\u2019s swollen face froze.\u201cHe told them everything. He gave up his friends\u2019 names,\u201d Marwa said. \u201cThen they pulled him from the room and asked me to leave.\u201d The interrogation was over.She kept her head down as she walked away down a long corridor, pretending not to see the prisoners lining each side with faces to the wall. Close to the entrance, she thought one of them was Omar, his flesh red and raw from the beating. But the man escorting her told her to keep her eyes straight ahead. \u201cYou need to forget where you were and what you saw,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep walking.\u201dThe heavens opened as Marwa walked, and she trudged and stumbled through the icy rain. When night fell, she had lost count of the hours. She was crying uncontrollably. In her pants pocket, the weight of Omar\u2019s wallet, empty aside from his identification card, pushed against her body. A soldier trailed her home in his car until he got bored, leering from behind the wheel as he offered to take her home.Back at her aunt\u2019s house, she barely had the strength to speak. Again, she could later recall only flashes. The family fussing, her body so cold and weak. Samer, her son, was shouting. \u201cWhy did you and Baba leave me? I waited for you, why did you leave me?\u201dMarwa gave birth to her second son, Yousuf, in Lebanon. She had refused to leave the house when the first contractions began, inconsolable at the thought of giving birth without Omar. But time dulled her fear, and as the curly-haired newborn grew, she learned day by day what it meant to live as a refugee and a single parent, one of hundreds of thousands scattered by the conflict, not knowing whether jailed loved ones had survived.Her small house perched on the edge of a town in the rolling Bekaa Valley was full of people. Relatives came in and out, helping with the children and watching as Yousuf grew milk teeth and Samer went to school and adjusted to life in a strange country. Nothing filled the void.Samer, now 6 years old, rejected any suggestion that his father was not coming back, even though he could barely recall his likeness outside of the images she showed him on her cellphone. In time, Yousuf would do the same.Marwa remembered everything. The day Omar posed for her camera in 2011, grinning as he held the uprising\u2019s green-white-and-black flag aloft. How his body would visibly relax in their home when he returned from a long day. There had also been long nights lost in conversation, with Omar\u2019s laugh, when it came, sounding so deep that it seemed to come right from his belly.The uprising felt like a bad dream. \u201cWhat did their \u2018freedom\u2019 bring me?\u201d she asked herself. The protests had scared her, but she had agreed with their goals of achieving a future without fear. Now she would trade them all for one more day with him.She wondered what he would find if that did happen. The years had changed her. \u201cI\u2019m not me anymore. I\u2019m not the same girl,\u201d she thought. But she also feared that she had not changed fast enough and couldn\u2019t give her sons what they needed. The first time Samer was beaten up at school for being an outsider, she told him to keep out of trouble. They were guests in Lebanon and they had to be careful.In moments of introspection, Marwa could not believe that Omar would have survived. To live through the cruelty she had witnessed would be a miracle.When a Syrian military defector smuggled photographs out of Syria showing broken bodies from a nearby prison, she scrutinised the images. One of them looked like Omar, she thought. He must be dead.She would never learn otherwise.Inside State Security\u2019s Al Khattib branch, one of the most notorious in downtown Damascus, Omar was packed in a 4-by-5-yard cell with dozens of other prisoners. Across the country, tens of thousands of people had disappeared along an archipelago of torture centres. Months after Omar was imprisoned, he was joined in the cell by a man of Marwa\u2019s age, Mohammad, who had also seen the protests as a dawning of fresh hope.The newcomer was taken aback when he first met his neighbour. Omar had been terribly tortured, Mohammad later recalled. In photographs later shared by his family, Omar is barrel-chested with arms big enough to envelop Marwa and Samer. When Mohammad met him, his collarbone ridged out of his skin.The men spoke every night to ward off boredom and despair. False confessions made repeatedly under torture filled them both with shame. When guards appeared weekly to summon certain cellmates, never to return, the pair began to believe rumours that executions were accelerating.Cellmates who clung too tightly to the memories of people they had loved outside the prison walls were driven mad, Mohammad said. \u201cI forced myself to forget everyone I could. But Omar refused.\u201dOn some nights, Omar spoke only of the happy memories from Daraya and the early days of his marriage. On others, he was racked with guilt. For leaving Marwa behind with a child he had never met, and for the times he had lost his temper with a wife who loved him unconditionally.He didn\u2019t know where she was, but he knew he had left her alone. \u201cHe wanted to get back to her to make everything right,\u201d Mohammad said.Eventually the two men were separated. They met one more time, late at night in the prison corridor. When they hugged, Omar was even thinner than Mohammad remembered. Mohammad thought the situation was hopeless, but Omar insisted, \u201cWe\u2019ll get out of here.\u201dOmar weighed heavily on his mind after Mohammad was abruptly released from prison, without explanation, in December 2013. The first months of freedom were a blur - 10 days in Damascus, then to Lebanon, Turkey, and across the Mediterranean on a smuggler\u2019s boat - but the vision of his friend remained clear.After reaching the Netherlands, Mohammad said, he searched for his cellmate\u2019s name on Facebook, and when he found the profile of a woman who appeared to be Omar\u2019s mother, he finally composed a message. She replied immediately.Within a week, he had a number for Omar\u2019s wife, and clutching the phone nervously one day around noon, he punched in the number and waited. When a woman picked up, he introduced himself carefully and explained as best he could.On the other end of the line, 3,200km away in Lebanon, there was silence. Marwa\u2019s head was spinning. She knew she was still in her living room, but suddenly her body felt very far away.\u201cI was hanging between the earth and the sky,\u201d she said.Mohammad was telling her about Omar. How the guards used to call him by his prison number and how he had spent every night plotting ways to get back to her.When Mohammad was sure she believed him, he told her he had another message. \u201cHe just wants you to forgive him.\u201d Hearing nothing down the line, he continued. \u201cIf God grants him the strength to get out of there, he says he will never stop trying to make it up to you.\u201dAn even longer pause followed. Then he realised she was crying.-Washington PostMax - 36 \u00b0CMin - 17 \u00b0CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Ambassador Francois Delattre made clear at a Security Council meeting that the European Union will not participate in rebuilding Syria \"unless a political transition is effectively carried out - with constitutional and electoral processes carried out in a sincere and meaningful way.\"Syria's Assad says rebuilding is 'top priority'The politics of reconstruction in SyriaRussia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, whose country is militarily backing Syrian President Bashar Assad, countered that reconstruction should not be linked to politics and the international community should join the country's recovery effort now.But Western nations are adamant about withholding reconstruction money to maximize pressure for a political transition.Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the National Centre for State Defence Control said last week that Moscow's will use their experience in rebuilding post Second World War,to help rebuild Syria\"In the course of solving vital tasks for the Syrian people to restore the country, it is necessary to use historical experience.\u00a0Here we can turn to history and the Russian state.\u00a0I believe that the experience of our motherland in the restoration of the national economy after the Great Patriotic War is unparalleled,\"\u00a0Mizintsev\u00a0said. \"The period of restoration of our country, initially estimated at 15 years, was reduced several times.\u00a0In five years, the country became the world's second most powerful economic power.\"Major powers including the five veto-wielding Security Council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - agreed on a roadmap for a Syrian political transition at a meeting in Geneva on June 30, 2012, about 16 months after the Syrian conflict began.The roadmap starts with the establishment of a transitional governing body vested with full executive powers, includes drafting a new constitution, and ends with elections. Successive U.N. envoys have tried to get the government and opposition to the negotiating table, so far unsuccessfully. The current U.N. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is now working to establish on a committee to draft a new constitution.After seven years of war, the country has suffered catastrophic damage and massive rebuilding is needed. Ground warfare, airstrikes and barrel bombs have left entire cities and infrastructure a landscape of rubble. In some places like Aleppo, the destruction is reminiscent of World War II devastation.Earlier this year, the government estimated reconstruction will cost some $200 billion dollars and last 15 years. But like neighboring Iraq, which also needs massive reconstruction after the war against the Islamic State extremist group, no one is offering much to help fund the process.Russia's Polyansky told the council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria that \"a critical challenge\" to the Assad government's call this month for the return of over 5.6 million refugees \"is the revival of the Syrian national economy - the generation of new jobs.\"\"The country is experiencing an acute shortage of construction materials and heavy equipment for which fuel is necessary,\" he said, and the educational and health systems need to be revived.Polyansky then said: \"It would be wise for all international partners to join assistance in the Syrian recovery effort, to eschew artificial linkages to political momentum.\"More broadly, he called for Syria to be reintegrated into the regional trade and economic system which \"will best advance the objective of overall normalization of relations among states in the Middle East.\"\"And, of course, stabilization will help to advance the U.N.-led political settlement process which is unanimously supported by all members of the Security Council,\" Polyansky said.But France's Delattre said a political transition with a new constitution and credible elections is \"the essential condition for the country's stability, and for our contribution to the financing of reconstruction.\"\"Without that,\" Delattre said, \"nothing can justify having France and the European Union engage in financing reconstruction.\"And he added that without \"a breakthrough\" in the political process, the humanitarian situation will never be fully resolved.\u00a0Max - 36 \u00b0CMin - 17 \u00b0CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don\u2019t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

It\u2019s simply not true", "classes": [], "content": "According to a report published in early May, Mexico has become the second-deadliest conflict zone in the world in 2016.The claim came from a press release for the 2017 edition of the Armed Conflict Survey (ACS) by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank. And a media frenzy followed. The IISS press release stated that the 23,000 deaths in 2016 that it attributes to Mexico\u2019s struggle against organized crime came second to the 50,000 fatalities caused by Syria\u2019s civil war.They said this was higher than those caused by conflicts in the rest of the countries covered by the survey, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and the so-called \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.The claim was shared extensively, including via a retweet by U.S. President Donald Trump. But it drew swift criticism from Mexico\u2019s government, which argued, among other things, that Mexico\u2019s organized crime-related violence is not comparable to armed conflicts in Syria or Iraq.In response, IISS published a blog post outlining why it thinks Mexico is in a state of conflict, including Mexico\u2019s own characterization of criminal groups as an existential threat under the previous government.But I argue that the comparison placing Mexico as the second-deadliest conflict zone is fallacious for two main reasons.First, the comparison did not take into account the vastly different sizes of the countries in the study. Mexico\u2019s population (127 million) is larger than the most recent population figures for Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen combined (114.2 million).All else being equal, it is expected that countries with larger populations will have more fatalities or homicides in absolute terms. For example, there where almost twice as many homicides in the U.S. (12,000) as there were fatalities in Yemen (7,000), but this is because the U.S. has a population that is 12 times bigger than Yemen\u2019s, not because it is deadlier than Yemen.To account for different population sizes in cross-national comparisons, mortality and homicide figures are usually expressed as incidents per 100,000 people. This captures the probability that individuals in a given country face of being killed, and so are a better measure than absolute figures.As seen in the graph below, once population sizes are taken into account, the probability of being killed in Mexico was much lower than in the rest of the countries in the ACS top five or in the Northern Triangle.Second, the figures being compared are not measuring the same phenomenon. In the report, fatalities in Mexico and Central America refer to the total number\u00a0of intentional homicides, while in the rest of the countries in the study they refer to deaths directly caused by armed conflicts.It is true that intentional homicides are sometimes used as a proxy measurement of organized crime activity in Mexico \u2013 something I am exploring in my ongoing research. However, that does not mean that it is appropriate to uncritically compare the absolute number of homicides in Mexico to conflict-related fatalities in other countries.That would suggest that all intentional homicides in Mexico \u2013 high as they may be \u2013 can be attributed to organized crime violence, which is far from the case.Previous editions of the ACS in 2015 and 2016 also included Mexico and reported similarly high levels of fatalities. But the level of coverage of the 2017 report reflects a vastly different global public agenda.Today, with Mexico-U.S. relations at a new low, a looming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement\u00a0and the promise of a new physical wall between the two countries, it is not surprising that IISS\u2019s press statement landed front and center in the international news media \u2013 even if such comparisons are not the main focus of the ACS.Journalists undeniably \u201chave to get better at reporting science.\u201d But academics and those involved in research \u2013 especially in controversial issues such as crime and security \u2013 also need to exercise care when publicizing their findings.There is a tension between the efforts to publicize research by highlighting headline-grabbing findings, and the risk of having such findings overhyped and misrepresented, or even spun into a deliberate political agenda, as the right-wing Breitbart News did with the IISS announcement.Academics and think tanks may not have much control over how their findings are reported by the media once they are released to the public. So it is imperative to take extra care when communicating them to the press, and setting out clearly what are the limitations of the findings, as well as the generalizations that can accurately be drawn from them.Patricio R.

Well, perhaps the second. Or third. Whatever. In my November 24 op-ed for Mexico News Daily, entitled \u201cPew bombshell won\u2019t change the rhetoric,\u201d I botched it big-time.In that piece I described how the Right\u2019s \u2013 and in particular Donald Trump\u2019s \u2013 bigoted rhetoric against Mexican immigrants would not change despite the latest Pew research indicating the U.S. is experiencing a net loss of Mexican immigrants.My reasons were essentially twofold, and based both on the hard and social sciences. First, through the process of evolution by natural selection, we have been hard-wired to exhibit xenophobia and tribalism, to be naturally suspicious of groups different from us (such as Mexicans), and to blame others for our self-made problems.Second, fear sells. As I\u2019ve said before, you can\u2019t keep it on the shelves. In this case, the fear of the brown-skinned \u201cothers\u201d who may be taking our jobs, raping our women and introducing our children to drugs. You know \u2013 the Ann Coulter-type racist polemic.Well, when I said the rhetoric wouldn\u2019t change, I was wrong. It has more than changed, it has completely disappeared.After the Islamist Paris and San Bernardino attacks, the GOP found another, even more threatening menace to the Norman Rockwell American way of life: Muslims! It seems that Mexicans are off the hook (for now). Instead of selling the fears of job losses and social degradations at the hands of America\u2019s great unwashed Mexican migrants, we\u2019ve stumbled upon a new fall guy to distract our attention from our self-caused endemic problems.Namely, Muslims who want to impose sharia law, whose goal is to create a new caliphate in Middle America, who are striving to instill terror on us infidels to the point of forcing our women to wear bags, our men to grow beards and profess allegiance to Allah and his prophet Mohamed.Gone is the Orwellian Trump-speak of building \u201cbig beautiful walls\u201d or deporting 11 million undocumented workers along with their American citizen children. No, sir. There\u2019s a much more succulent scapegoat to roast over the spit of ignorance. Now it\u2019s about banning all Muslim entries into the U.S., requiring Muslims to register with government authorities, and turning back all would-be Syrian refugees.But to give credit where credit is due, Trump and his acolytes aren\u2019t just shooting from the hip: within the vade-mecum of the GOP there\u2019s plenty of historic precedent for these policies. For example there\u2019s the return of a thousand asylum-seeking Jews aboard the MS St. Luis in 1939, where a quarter later died in death camps. Or the internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War and the confiscation of their property. The Donald has done his homework!Now, I\u2019ll be first to admit that Islam has a problem. Unlike some of my fellow secular humanists (with whom I\u2019m engaged in perpetual debate over this issue), I\u2019m no fan of the tenets of Islam. It\u2019s a backwards, repressive, too-often violent, Bronze-Age mythology that should be relegated to our prehistory.Luckily, most American Muslims are nominal believers, not unlike Mexican Catholics. It\u2019s more about cultural comfort than the literal belief that the Prophet flew to the heavens on a winged horse or that a cracker literally turns into the body of Christ.So I won\u2019t go out on a limb again by predicting that the hyper-partisan rhetoric against American Muslims or Syrian asylum seekers is here to stay. Indeed, if the aphorism that history repeats itself holds any truth, then we might expect those dirty Italians or drunken Irish to take their turns on the block of flapdoodle and pestilential public policy ideas once more.Among Trump\u2019s semi-literate hillbilly base, an enemy will always be needed: trying to sell the nuanced discussion of facts to people with only a dozen working synapses is tantamount to trying to sell a sensible Volvo to someone only in the market for a sexy, hopped-up Camaro.If there is a more accurate condemnation of the once drolly and now hectoring preachments of a politically cynical and capricious GOP, I am at a loss to explain what it might be.Until next year, wishing everyone a happy holiday season.Glen Olives Thompson is a professor of North American Law at La Salle University in Chihuahua, a specialist in law and public policy and a regular contributor to Mexico News Daily.The economy secretary said today that the three NAFTA partners need to show flexibility to reach an updated trade agreement.Trade talks between Mexico and the US will continue next week as new sticking points have surfaced over tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles.Mexico has publicly accepted for the first time the US proposal to include set minimum wages for the automotive industry as part of a new agreement.Violence in Mexico is largely fueled by the illegal entry of weapons from the United States, says Interior Secretary Alfonso Navarrete Prida.With the annual grape harvest season in full swing, this might be a good time to enjoy a glass or two of Mexican wine.Artisans from a small indigenous community in Oaxaca complain that a British clothing retailer is selling imitations of their designs.30sharesMaking love without paying extortion is the theme of a new municipal law in Guadalajara that means\u00a0public displays of affection, \u00a0FULL STORYA children\u2019s advocacy organization has criticized Mexican authorities for separating migrant children older than 12 from their families.Attractive female models often employed at events to greet guests or simply to act as eye candy will not be allowed at government events in Mexico City.Walmart is expanding its presence in retail fuel sales: it began selling propane last month in some stores and is now getting ready to sell automotive fuel.The blush of youth, coupled with a significant surge of hormones, eclipsed whatever little judgment they may have possessed on that fateful night.Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s 2017 suicide rate of 8.9 per 100,000 was nearly twice what it was in 2010.

Among those killed was Mora\u2019s son, Manuel.The two leaders, who are also former civil defense group founders, have been rivals for some time, and their enmity came to a head in December. Those involved in the shooting turned themselves in after being asked to do so by the state\u2019s then-security commissioner, Alfredo Castillo.But this week a judge ruled that Mora and his followers should be set free after it could not be established who fired first, and that the shooters were acting in self-defense. Another argument was that both sides enjoyed legitimacy as being part of the Fuerza Rural, a community police force.Mora was the first to be released. Upon leaving the Mil Cumbres prison last night he said he was going to dedicate himself to his farm and \u201ccontinue fighting as best I can for my people in La Ruana, through the Fuerza Rural, and perhaps in politics.\u201dMora, who has previously indicated interest in running for political office, confirmed he is meeting today with Dante Delgado, leader of the Citizens\u2019 Movement party.

But I couldn\u2019t. Truth be told, I was suffering from a bit of pope fatigue.But now that he\u2019s gone back to the Vatican, I can listen to my favorite classic rock station uninterrupted by papal proclamations. The ubiquitous, Chinese-made,\u00a0pope-themed T-shirts are already wearing out in this unseasonably warm February in Chihuahua and will soon be consigned to rags for polishing furniture.El Papa looked disturbingly healthy, which means there\u2019s undoubtedly a return visit in the works. In the meantime, I intend to enjoy my reprieve from my kids\u2019 questions, such as, \u201cDoes the pope fart?\u201d And, \u201cWhy does he wear a dress?\u201dI\u2019m not generally a fan of popes or imams or evangelical preachers or New Age spiritualists or anyone else who claims special knowledge that the rest of us aren\u2019t privy to and cannot hope to understand without special help. Not that all of these people are necessarily frauds or charlatans \u2013 though many surely are \u2013 it\u2019s just that no matter how hard I try I just can\u2019t bring myself to buy what they\u2019re selling.Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve never been desperately in want of security, love, or comfort, or perhaps I\u2019m overly infatuated with the sciences. I couldn\u2019t say that if I were unlucky enough through the happenstance of birth to be hopelessly poor in a violent society I wouldn\u2019t be prone to the seductions of the supernatural, or that had I been raised in a piously religious family I wouldn\u2019t perhaps cling to its vacuous certainties.Even when dry-heaving from air sickness before jumping out of perfectly good airplanes as a U.S. Army soldier, I never prayed to a higher power. (As an Army buck private I distinctly remember my bemusement at seeing an ashen-faced, square-jawed Marine captain crossing himself before we abandoned gravity on our required night jump from a C-130 over the pine forests of Georgia.)It could be I\u2019m just wired differently. And of course it could be something else I\u2019m entirely unaware of.When Pope Francis visited Mexico his prescient counsel left a wake of hope and general agreement behind it. But the wake of that papal ship on white-capped sea of brusque intolerance, greed and tribalism hasn\u2019t lasted long.It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a pessimist, but rather just a student of history, and as Hegel said (always one to state the obvious), we learn from history that we do not learn from history.Francis\u2019 humanist message of tolerance and love, his deep suspicion of greed and consumerism, his advocacy for the protection of the environment, his fomenting of the idea that all of our species should be entitled to at least minimally dignified existences, came across well. Heads nodded in agreement.And it sounded all-too familiar. Pope John Paul II said many of the same things on his Mexican papal visit in 1979 (followed by four more trips to Mexico in subsequent decades). But nothing much came of John Paul\u2019s visits, and nothing will come of Francis\u2019.Political corruption will continue (the irony of a church railing against corruption when in the not-too-distant past religious patronage and the open selling of church favors was not considered in the least bit corrupt). Wealth will continue to concentrate, as Oxfam and Thomas Piketty have consistently predicted, in both the U.S. and Mexico.And poor Mexicans will be treated as second-class citizens within their own country, and as sub-humans within the United States, consigned to live in a dystopia where property rights rank decidedly higher than the rights of humans.But something important has changed. John Paul II was revered by conservative American politicians. Only leftist radicals and Sinead O\u2019Conner would dare speak ill of him. But the American political landscape is very different now \u2013 it is more principled (in a bad way) and less pragmatic.At the very height of irony, it is now the secular humanists on the Left who find themselves praising the moral landscape envisioned by Francis, while GOP politicians either hold him in open contempt, or avoid talking about him. (As to the latter, that can only last until the general election gets under way, which I await with breath baited by a communion wafer.)Like the American body politic, the Catholic Church has changed as well. Indeed, it has undergone an uncodified reformation under the leadership of Pope Francis. And this reformation is deliciously radical for one reason in particular: it exemplifies traditional Christian values. Not the \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong because my dogma says so,\u201d values, but rather the values of love thy neighbor as thyself, turn the other cheek, eschew greed, and protect the Earth.Precisely the values that the American Religious Right hate. Their values are drawn from the Bronze Age Pentateuch: hate thy neighbor, give no thought for tomorrow, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, get as much as you can while you can, god gave us the Earth to exploit as we wish, and slavery is not such a bad thing \u2013 indeed, the trafficking of humans is just good business.The pope\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d Christian values have a particular secular humanist flavor to them. Which is undoubtedly the reason the American Right has turned against Pope Francis with such spittle-flecked vitriol.On that last sunny Wednesday in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, the pope visited a prison and told the inmates to \u201cwork so that this society which uses people and discards them will not go on claiming victims.\u201d He then celebrated mass at a dusty fairgrounds overlooking the Rio Bravo, praying for the migrant dead.(Since 1994, over 7,000 desiccated human remains have been found in the Arizona desert, but who\u2019s really counting?)Later, he obliquely criticized Donald Trump, saying, \u201ca person who only thinks about building walls . . . and not building bridges, is not a Christian.\u201d In an in-flight press conference back to the (ironically walled) Vatican, he came dangerously close to condoning artificial birth control in light of the spread of the Zika virus.(Octogenarian virgin Catholic theologians and apologists have been walking back the pope\u2019s comments ever since \u2013 parsing, qualifying and befriending the necessary casuistry to say that the pope didn\u2019t say what he said.)Donald Trump, of course, did the gentlemanly thing, and threatened a lawsuit. He also said, \u201cI don\u2019t think [Pope Francis] understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico.\u201dIt is almost universally agreed that Trump is a horse\u2019s ass of such epic proportions (even among his supporters) that it would be hard to exaggerate his carnival-barking ugliness. But he isn\u2019t dumb.He must know, assuming he has policy advisers who can read, that Mexican immigrants to the U.S. (legal or otherwise) are a benefit to the U.S. economy, as even some conservative groups have reluctantly admitted, and that the U.S. is experiencing a net loss of illegal immigrants.Moreover, even a cursory look at FBI crime data reveals that illegal immigrants are more law abiding than average U.S. citizens, and not, as it were, drug dealers, rapists and thieves. But empirically verifiable data isn\u2019t very sexy. As sociologist Barry Glassner pointed out in his seminal work The Culture of Fear, the lifeblood of American politics and public media is fear.Frightening people to the very edge of panic is the sin qua non for Republican politics. And the more clear and present the danger, the better: raping Mexicans, dodgy Syrian refugees (watch out for those elderly women with grandchildren \u2013 they\u2019re in cahoots with ISIS), and communism 2.0 (i.e. Bernie Sanders), to name but a few scary memes. It doesn\u2019t really matter what you\u2019re afraid of, just choose your favorite flavor \u2013 blacks, Mexicans, drugs, atheists, books, ad nauseam.But if this were not enough, we now have the Zika virus. Maine\u2019s pride and joy \u2013 Republican Gov. Paul LePage \u2013 recently waxed hysterical that immigrants and asylum seekers were bringing with them deadly diseases incubated by the \u201cziki fly.\u201d Never mind that no such thing exists. Or that the Zika virus is a mild mosquito borne illness only (potentially) dangerous to the fetuses of pregnant women \u2013 It\u2019s fucking scary.So expect a new conspiracy theory in the very near future that the Mexican government plans to infect Gringolandia with Zika (or \u201cziki\u201d if you prefer \u2013 it doesn\u2019t much matter) so that all new Gabacho babies will be born with microcephaly. In a generation, all Americans will have heads the size of Florida oranges, and it will be easy to take back the land stolen in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.But I digress. The\u00a0point I\u2019m trying to make, perhaps too circuitously for my politically conservative readers, friends and colleagues, is this: consider that your fair weather intellectual leaders on the Right have turned toward cannibalizing their traditionally greatest cultural ally \u2013 the leader of the Catholic Church and the representative of Christ on our little blue planet. Particularly on the issue of immigration.But curiously, the current pope hasn\u2019t said anything different regarding immigration than Pope John Paul II, or even Pope Pius XII, for that matter.We might forgive Maine\u2019s Forrest Gump-of-a-governor LePage for his idiocy. (After all, his surname sounds suspiciously French, which can only mean he\u2019s a Frenchurian socialist candidate implanted specifically to discredit the Republican Party to ensure the election of a Sanders clone in Maine\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial race.)But then there\u2019s Trump, who is hardly alone in his revulsion of the pope\u2019s preachings on economic equality, climate change, or immigration. Rush Limbaugh expressed his dismay that the pope was not actively campaigning for Bernie Sanders. Jeb! Bush actually defended (!) Donald Trump, saying that it was not appropriate for the pope to question Trump\u2019s Christian faith.Ben Carson, in a brief instance of consciousness, said \u201cenforcing our immigration laws is not in contradiction of love and kindness.\u201d (Strange, coming from a man who has proposed drone strikes at the border, the desert itself apparently not efficient enough in dealing death to children.)Jeb! (I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s legally changed his name to include an exclamation point) of course has wisely dropped out of the race, testament to the fact that money really can\u2019t buy you love, while Carson stubbornly refuses to throw in the towel, despite polling numbers lower than his pulse rate (but book sales remain brisk).Republicans, of course, have never liked this pope. In 2015, during the pope\u2019s U.S. visit, Chris Christie said, \u201cI just think the pope is wrong.\u201d He went on to pontificate (what a glorious verb) that the pope was only infallible on religious matters and not political ones, as if one could possibly separate the two, especially in America.It has now become a point of pride among GOP politicians to openly disagree with the pontiff. Notably, Rick Santorum, a hyper-devout Catholic to the point of psychosis, echoed Christie\u2019s sentiments, apparently inoculated against the (more dangerous than Zika) virus of philosophical consistency.Rick Perry, despite his new black-framed eyeglasses, and his criticisms of the pope\u2019s radical social views, could never quite recover from his statement that Jesus\u2019 native language was English, or viral photos of his supporters carrying signs reading \u201cHome Scholer\u2019s [sic] for Perry.\u201dSo here I am, and here you are, living inside a calliope of the absurd. Mexicans and Americans are more alike than either would like to believe. The fact is, we love our children and hope for better lives for them. We go to work every day with\u00a0hope for the realization of the distant light of peace, and comfort, and stability.We suffer from asinine laws passed by the self-studied idiots we elect. We too easily discard reason for passion, and live internal fantasy lives where quiet desperation is unknown.Some might be confused by this essay. Do I think that the pope is saying some sensible, moral, and ethical things? You bet. Do I believe in the teaching of the Catholic Church? Not so much. Do I think the current gaggle of GOP candidates has any solutions for the observable and endemic decline of America? Absolutely not.The truth is we are at war. Both Mexico and the United States. With ourselves. All civilizations and all countries experience their Belle \u00c9poque, their apogee of success, some more modestly than others. The decade following WWII found America at the very height of its power, economic prosperity, geopolitical influence, and limitless hope in the perfection of an enlightened civilization.The Sumerians, the Greeks, the Romans, and countless others have fallen from their own weight so slowly as to be imperceptible by a single generation. The Greeks thought themselves to be exceptional, as did the Romans, as do Americans now.America\u2019s empire in turn is being slowly diluted and retracted. Rome distracted its citizenry with gladiators. We\u2019re distracted by the modern day equivalent \u2013 pudgy men in suits battling and insulting each other with word salads of nonsense, where sloganeering, ridiculous platitudes and religious adherence to failed ideologies have replaced sensible public policy ideas, where pandering to morons and hillbillies is quite possibly the only way to get elected.It is entirely likely that our next president will be elected by World Wrestling Federation fans. Donald Trump\u2019s ridiculous comb-over is just a business mogul\u2019s mullet.Mexico\u2019s fate, because it has chosen (perhaps unwillingly) to be a satellite of its powerful northern neighbor, may be written as well. If there was ever a time for Mexico to decouple itself from America, to write its own policies and forge its own independent future, it is now.There is no shortage of models to emulate (many northern European countries seem to have pretty much nailed the whole \u201cgood governance\u201d thing).

A lightning bolt can result when the energy is discharged.Strong explosions were reported at the volcano on Friday morning, and several pyroclastic flows \u2014 hot gas and rock \u2014 were seen traveling down the western flank, reported Volcano Discovery.The volcano has seen some intense eruptive activity in the past four months, prompting specialists from the University of Colima to fly over it and have a look. But while doing so the mountain gave a demonstration of its force with an explosion in the center of the crater.A gray column of gas and vapor formed and rose above the plane carrying the volcanologists. One of them was Nick Varley of the sciences faculty at the university. \u201cIt\u2019s good luck when that happens because it\u2019s interesting to see exactly where in the crater the explosions are originating. It\u2019s very valuable information.\u201dThe temperatures in the columns of gas that result can be as high as 300 C.During their flight the scientists discovered that the many recent explosions have destroyed a dome that had formed within the crater, which measures 170-190 meters across and some 30 meters deep.They expect the explosions to continue, with about 15-20 eruptions a day.Eruptions in February produced some spectacular videos and still photos.Source: Televisa (sp)La Mar\u00eda is a crater lake in Colima, an enchanting, hidden-away place where you can enjoy a fireworks show of a sort at night.More than 360,000 people live within a 25-kilometer radius of the volcano El Popo.326sharesDon Goyo is having none of the cold wave taking over Mexico: an eruption at the volcano yesterday could be \u00a0FULL STORY1sharesEl Popo is angry, according to one report this morning.

The island\u2019s name means \u201cpeace and tranquillity\u201d and as it\u2019s only accessible via one bridge linking it to the mainland, it\u2019s also secluded and private \u2014 making it an ideal spot for US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s historic June 12 summit. But until a few decades ago, the island went by a different name, Pulau Belakang Mati \u2014 which roughly translates to \u201cisland of death from behind\u201d. And that gives some indication of this carefree island\u2019s dark past. One theory suggests the old name derived from Sentosa\u2019s former association with piracy, as the 500-hectare tropical island was reportedly a popular pirates\u2019 hideaway. Another theory taps into legends of the spirit world. \u201c[The theory] speaks of the island being the \u2018paradise\u2019 of \u2018warrior spirits\u2019 whose bodies were entombed at [nearby island] Pulau Brani,\u201d the National Library Board of Singapore said. But the ominous name could also refer to a deadly disease that swept the island in the late 1840s and came close to wiping out the entire population. The island\u2019s association with death and bloodshed didn\u2019t end there \u2014 it also had a big, and horrific, role in World War II. After the surrender of Singapore to Japanese forces in 1942, Sentosa was turned into a brutal camp for Australian and British prisoners of war. It was also a killing field for Singaporean Chinese people who, during the Japanese occupation, were accused of anti-Japanese activities and executed. The accused, mostly civilians, were rounded up on a two-kilometre beach \u2014 now a massive golf course \u2014 and shot dead, with their bodies hurled into the sea. About 300 corpses washed ashore during the Japanese occupation, the Straits Times reported. Fort Siloso, a major attraction on Sentosa, was used during the war to guard against approaches to Singapore. Its guns, ammunition bunkers and tunnels are on display, along with Singapore\u2019s biggest collection of WWII memorabilia. Things changed during the 1970s when the Singaporean government developed the island as a tourist destination \u2014 and gave it its current, more visitor-friendly name. Far from the violence of its past, the island began to be synonymous with outdoor leisure, shopping and luxury, and as well as being a tourism powerhouse, it\u2019s also home to some of Singapore\u2019s richest people, with waterfront villas priced at up to $39 million. It also has 17 hotels, two golf courses, a three-kilometre beach lined with palm trees, an award-winning and a bunch of major attractions \u2014 Universal Studios Singapore, a Madame Tussauds museum, a water theme park, a nature park and massive shopping meccas.Next week\u2019s summit \u2014 the first sitting between the leaders of the US and North Korea \u2014 will be held at the luxury, five-star Capella hotel, a sprawling, opulent complex that\u2019s a favourite with A-list celebrities, and where the most lavish rooms cost close to $10,000 for a night. The hotel, which incorporates two colonial buildings that housed British officers in the 1880s, is known for its luxury amenities, impeccable service and privacy, according to the Associated Press. It\u2019s been given a fresh coat of paint and had red carpets rolled in ahead of the historic summit.

At the epic media briefing that followed the summit, Mr Trump claimed not to have slept for 25 hours. As the leaders finally depart, read our full wrap of the momentous day here.7.10pmOn meeting KimBefore the summit, Mr Trump said he was sure he would know how successful it would be in the first minute. He did not back away from that today \u2014 in fact, he said it took far less than that.\u201cYeah, I have said that about relationships, I have said that about people. You know, [I can tell] in the first second. I was generous and said five seconds but you know in the first second in some cases. Sometimes that doesn\u2019t work out, but sometimes it does. From the beginning we got along, but there\u2019s been a lot of groundwork [by officials before the meeting].\u201dHe said he trusted Kim to follow through on what he had promised. \u201cI think he\u2019ll do it. I really believe that \u2014 otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201dHe was sure the destruction of the engine missile site would be a major turning point.\u201cI may stand before you in six months and say, \u2018Hey, I was wrong.\u2019 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever admit that but I\u2019ll find some kind of excuse,\u201d he said to laughter from the hundreds of journalists.6.58pmNorth Korea want to make a deal, but I can\u2019t be certain, says Trump Mr Trump said nothing could be assumed or taken for granted. He said he had been making deals his whole life and was confident North Korea and Kim wanted a deal as well.\u201cYou can\u2019t ensure anything. All I can say is that they want to make a deal. That\u2019s what I do. My whole life has been deals. I\u2019ve done great at it. That\u2019s what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn\u2019t. A lot of politicians don\u2019t. That\u2019s not their thing but it is my thing. Again, this really could have been done I think easier a long time ago, but I know \u2014 I just feel very strongly, my instinct, my ability or talent, they want to make a deal and making a deal is a great thing for the world.\u201d6.54pmTrump sledges Trudeau again - and speaks about the viral Angela Merkel pictureMr Trump has not backed away from previous statements he made about the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau being dishonest and weak.He was asked about the statements and the recent tension with other G7 leaders, especially over trade.\u201cI had a very good meeting at the G7 \u2014 I\u2019ll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, we finished the meeting ... everybody was happy and I agreed to sign something. I asked for changes. I demanded changes. Those changes were made. The picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I\u2019m sitting there like that, that picture is we\u2019re waiting for the document because I wanted to see the final document [with changes] as I requested. It was friendly. I know it didn\u2019t look friendly, it wasn\u2019t nasty both ways, I wasn\u2019t angry at her. Actually we were talking about the whole group about something unrelated to anything, very friendly, waiting for the document back to read.\u201dHe then saw Mr Trudeau\u2019s media conference, and it made him angry. \u201cWhen I got to the plane, I think Justin didn\u2019t know Air Force one has about 20 televisions, and I see the television and he\u2019s giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. I say, \u2018Push him around? We just shook hands.\u2019 It was very friendly.\u201dMr Trudeau\u2019s comments would cost Canadians, he added.6.46pmTrump: I don\u2019t want to be threateningMr Trump said he didn\u2019t raise military options with Kim after previously threatening to destroy him. He told the reporter who asked about it the question was fair, given the previous rhetoric.\u201cYeah, I know. That\u2019s a tough thing to talk about because I don\u2019t want to be threatening. They understood that.\u201dAsked about his promise of \u201cfire and fury\u201d, he said: \u201cWell, at that time we needed perhaps fire and fury because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States and certainly Japan wasn\u2019t going to allow it either. Japan is right next door.\u201d6.43pmSanctions will remain for nowMr Trump said the sanctions against North Korea would remain until the US was satisfied denuclearisation was happening.\u201cThe sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor. Sanctions played a big role but they\u2019ll come off at that point. I hope it\u2019s gonna be soon. But they\u2019ll come off \u2014 as you know and as I have said, the sanctions right now remain, but at a certain point, I actually look forward to taking them off, and they\u2019ll come off when we know we\u2019re down the road where it\u2019s not going to happen, nothing is going to happen.6.37pmHuman rights was spoken about \u2014 briefly.Mr Trump said it was discussed, but denuclearisation was the key focus.\u201cObviously that\u2019s where we started and where we ended. But they will be doing things, and I think he [Kim] wants to do things. I think he wants to \u2014 you\u2019d be very surprised. Very smart, very good negotiator. Wants to do the right thing. You know, he brought up the fact that in the past they took dialogue \u2014 they never were like we are.\u201dHe said there had not been anything like what was being proposed now.He said there had been previous pledges from the North Koreans \u2014 especially after a deal with President Clinton in 1994 \u2014 that achieved nothing, with \u201cmillions\u201d given by the US failing stop the nuclear program.\u201cBut this is a much different time and this is a much different president, in all fairness,\u201d said Mr Trump. \u201cThis is very important to me.\u201d6.34pmNo concessions by the US, Trump saysMr Trump denied the US had conceded anything on the subject of verifiable or irreversible denuclearisation. He pointed to the contract the two leaders had just signed.\u201cNot at all. If you look at it \u2014 it said we are going to, let\u2019s see here \u2014 it will be gone, I don\u2019t think you can be any more plain than what we\u2019re asking \u2014 issues relating to the establishment of the new US-DPRK relationship. We talk about the guarantees and we talk about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. This is the document that we just signed.\u201d6.31pmRemains of POWs will be returned to the USThis was something Mr Trump had not planned on raising. He did so almost at the last minute.\u201cThe remains will be coming back. They\u2019re going to start that process immediately. But so many people, even during the campaign, they\u2019d say, \u2018Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back? Or my father back?\u2019 So many people asked me this question, and, you know, I said, \u2018Look, we don\u2019t get along too well with that particular group of people, but know do,\u2019\u201d Mr Trump said.\u201cHe agreed to that so quickly. It was a very nice thing and he understands it. So for the thousands and thousands, I guess way over 6000 that we know of in terms of the remains, they\u2019ll be brought back.\u201d6.26pm \u2018He is very talented\u2019Mr Trump was asked by a journalist how he could praise Kim and call him \u201ctalented\u201d when he had been a murderous dictator.\u201cHe is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don\u2019t say it was nice, he ran it \u2014 very few people at that age, you can take one out of 10,000 probably who couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d6.20pmNorth Korea to destroy missile testing siteMr Trump said he has been told by Kim that a nuclear missile testing site will be destroyed.He said the situation on the Korean Peninsula should have been resolved years ago.\u201cWe\u2019re going to resolve it.\u201d6.16pmTrump: This was historicThe US President thanked his counterparts in Singapore, Japan and China for their help in getting to this \u201cvery historic day\u201d.He said his meeting with Kim was productive and the two were ready to move towards a stronger, peaceful future.\u201cThe past does not have to define the future...adversarys can indeed become freinds [and] replace the horror of battle with blessings of peace\u201d.5.48pmTrump media conference to start soonMr Trump is about to speak to media about his historic summit with Kim. One of the key things people want answers about is the document both leaders signed.Mr Trump has so far only said it was a \u201cvery important document, a pretty comprehensive document\u201d.4.30pmTrump, Kim commit to \u2018complete denuclearisation\u2019Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have committed to the \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d of the Korean peninsula in a joint text.The document signed by both leaders specifies four key agreements between the US and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).Here\u2019s what the document said \u2014 and a brief explanation of what each point means.1.  The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the people of the two counties for peace and prosperity.This serves as an acknowledgement that the US and North Korea are seeking to leave their hostilies behind and move towards peace.2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.Until now, the US and South Korea have had an alliance against North Korea and its nuclear regime. This means the US and North Korea will move towards dialogue and pursue an end to their hostile relationship.3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.The Panmunjom Declaration was adopted by North and South Korea during the 2018 inter-Korean Summit in April. It stated that the two sides would agree to work together to end the Korean War and bring about a new era of peace, including denuclearisation. This point serves as a reiteration of that.4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.The United States and North Korea will work together to identify the remains of American Korean War casualties \u2014 a move veterans advocates have been pushing for. Over 7000 American service members from the war remain unaccounted for.We\u2019re still yet to hear anything about the process for denuclearisation, whether the US will lift its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions on North Korea or any other potential concessions that went into the deal.However, Mr Trump is expected to make a joint press conference in a few minutes. Stay tuned.4.00pmKim and Trump say goodbyeDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have officially said their warm farewells.Mr Trump spoke glowingly of the North Korean dictator, saying he has a \u201cgreat personality\u201d and is \u201cvery smart\u201d.When asked if he was a worthy negotiator, Mr Trump responded: \u201cA worthy negotiator...a very worthy, very smart negotiator. We had a terrific day and we learned a lot about each other and our countries.\u201dWhen pressed to elaborate on what he learnt from Kim, he said: \u201cI learnt he\u2019s a very talented man. I also learnt that he loves his country very much.\u201dThe President said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d invite the North Korean leader to the White House in Washington, echoing a similar comment he made last week.3.50pmTrump and Kim sign documentsDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down and signed a series of documents together.While the contents are yet to be specified, they said it \u201cworked out better than anyone could have predicted\u201d, adding that \u201cthe world will see a major change\u201d from it.\u201cWe are signing a very important document, a pretty comprehensive document, and we have had a really great term together, a great relationship,\u201d Mr Trump said before signing.He described \u201cthree comprehensive documents\u201d and said they\u2019d be handed out at a news conference this afternoon.He added that a lot of \u201cgoodwill\u201d and \u201cpreparation\u201d went into the letter, and noted that himself and Kim have a \u201cspecial bond\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\u201d the US President said.\u201cIt actually worked out far better for both of us than anyone would have predicted. This is going to lead to more and more and more... and it\u2019s an honour to be with you.\u201d\u201cWe are going to leave the past behind. The world will see major change,\u201d added Kim. He also expressed his thanks to Mr Trump for making the meeting happen.The pair sat side-by-side at a long wooden table decorated with white flowers, flanked with North Korean and American flags on either side.More details are expected to be announced when Mr Trump addresses the media later this evening.2.40pmTrump and Kim meeting goes off-script The summit has taken a strange new turn, with Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un now getting ready to sign a never-mentioned document.When the two leaders emerged from their working lunch, Mr Trump said things were going \u201cbetter than anybody could have expected\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s going great, we had a really fantastic meeting, lot of progress, really very positive. I think better than anybody could have expected, top of the line, really good,\u201d Mr Trump said of their meetings.He then said \u201cwe are going right now for a signing\u201d, noting there would be more details on the signing in a few minutes.The signing was not part of the original meeting schedule and this is the first time it\u2019s been mentioned today.The pair spent the next few minutes checking out Mr Trump\u2019s presidential limousine, which some experts have described as a \u201cbonding\u201d ritual.A US official told CNN the pair would sign an agreement to acknowledge their meetings\u2019 progress and pledge to keep momentum going.2.20pmTrump\u2019s Dennis Rodman tweet making the roundsA tweet Donald Trump posted in 2014 is once again making the rounds on social media.A few hours ago, Rodman broke down during a live interview with CNN while expressing his sentiments on the summit.When the former NBA star was asked what it was like when he visited North Korea and returned home during the Obama administration, he responded: \u201cObama didn\u2019t even give me the time of day. I asked him \u2014 I said, I have something to say from North Korea. He just brushed me off. But that didn\u2019t deter me.\u201cI kept going back ... I showed my loyalty to this country, and I said to everybody, \u2018The door will open.\u2019\u201dHe said today was \u201ca great day for everyone\u201d and that he was \u201cso happy\u201d that Mr Trump had met with Kim.Here were some of the responses to the 2014 tweet:Here is Trump saying that Dennis Rodman was either high or drunk when he said that Trump wanted to go to North Korea with him (2014)As most of us know, Dennis is in NK rn to help with the #TrumpKimSummit Trump must be infinite parallel universe versions of himself.#Resist https://t.co/caOwAbG65x2.05pmNorth Korea still left in the darkNorth Koreans still haven\u2019t seen any updates on the summit, according to Martyn Williams, a British journalist in the hermit nation.He tweeted a photo of the satellite feed he was picking up:Earlier it was reported that North Koreans didn\u2019t even know about the meeting until yesterday morning.This marked a break in tradition, as announcements of Kim\u2019s meetings with other world leaders are usually kept under wraps until he\u2019s back in the country.1.45pmThe question Kim refused to answerDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un appeared warm and pleasant before and after their private meeting \u2014 but there\u2019s one question the North Korean dictator refused to answer.When the 38-minute meeting concluded, the leaders waved their hands and approached the deck where foreign journalists were waiting.Kim was reportedly asked three times about denuclearisation, but he smiled and said nothing according to the White House press pool.The North Korean leader was asked twice, \u201cChairman Kim, will you denuclearise?\u201d and said nothing. The third unanswered question was: \u201cMr Kim, will you give up your nuclear weapons, sir?\u201dHe and Mr Trump walked away, ignoring questions that were shouted out to them.They then moved into the expanded meeting with their two interpreters and security details.Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was America\u2019s main goal for the summit. Everything was dependent on the hermit nation\u2019s willingness to denuclearise.Experts have argued the summit in itself is a win for North Korea, for the regime has long craved recognition and international status by meeting with a US leader.But according to the White House press pool, when Mr Trump was asked how the meeting went, he responded: \u201cVery very good!\u201dThe President is expected to give details of the discussion in an address to the media this evening.1.30pmMenu for the working lunch revealedHere\u2019s the menu for the working lunch, courtesy of the White House press pool:StartersTraditional prawn cocktail served with avocado saladGreen mango kerabu with honey lime dressing & fresh octopus\u201cOiseon\u201d (Korean stuffed cucumber)Main courseBeef short rib confit, served with potato dauphinois and steam broccolini, red wine sauce on the sideCombination of sweet & sour crispy pork and Yangzhou Fried Rice with homemade XO chili sauce\u201cDaegu jorim\u201d (Soy Braised cod fish with Radish, Asian Vegetables)DessertsDark chocolate tartlet ganacheHaagendazs vanilla iced cream with cherry coulisTropezienneSounds delish.1.10pmWhy Kim arrived before TrumpKim Jong-un\u2019s car pulled up to the summit at the Capella Hotel seven minutes before Donald Trump\u2019s did.Here\u2019s an interesting suggestion as to why, courtesy of the White House press pool: \u201cAccording Korean media, Mr Kim actually arrived in summit venue 7 minutes earlier than Mr Trump to show respect, it\u2019s cultural, the young one should arrive earlier than the elder one.\u201dMr Trump\u2019s choice of tie colour may have held significance too, with the reporter suggesting it\u2019s the colour North Koreans like best.12.30pmMoon Jae-in weighs in on summitSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has weighed in on the summit, saying he didn\u2019t sleep the night before.\u201cI too spent a sleepless night,\u201d he said, according to the Korea Times. \u201cI, along with all our people, sincerely hope that it will be a successful summit that will open a new era of complete denuclearisation, peace and a new relationship between South Korea, North Korea and the United States.\u201dHe said this is just the beginning of a \u201clong process\u201d to completely denuclearise the North and bring peace to the Korean peninsula.\u201cThe deep-rooted hostile relationship and the North Korean nuclear issue cannot be resolved in one single action in a meeting between leaders,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cEven after the two leaders open the dialogue, we will need a long process that may take one year, two years or even longer to completely resolve the issues.\u201d12.10pmTrump\u2019s big vow to Kim after historic meetingDonald Trump has vowed to Kim Jong-un that they will solve a \u201cbig dilemma\u201d together.After their private meeting, the leaders moved to a larger discussion with their advisers and interpreters present, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, White House chief of staff John Kelly and an interpreter.\u201cIt\u2019s a great honour to be with you, and I know we\u2019ll have tremendous success together,\u201d Mr Trump told the North Korean leader across the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll solve the big problem, the big dilemma, that until this point has been unable to be solved.\u201cWe will be successful. And I look forward to working on it with you. It will be done.\u201dIt\u2019s likely Mr Trump was referring to the need to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.More details of this exchange are expected when he addresses the media at 6pm (AEST).Press have now left the room and an expanded working lunch will get under way.11.50pmPrivate meeting ends between Trump and Kim The one-on-one meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un finished after 38 minutes, according to the White House press pool.As they left, Mr Trump said the meeting was \u201cvery, very good\u201d and that they have an \u201cexcellent relationship\u201d, according to Associated Press.The pair smiled a few times as they walked along the breezeway.\u201cMany people in the world will think of this as a ... form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,\u201d Kim\u2019s translator said at the end of the last breezeway walk, according to audio from CNN.11.40amDennis Rodman breaks down during interviewThe former NBA star burst into tears during a passionate live interview about the summit.Appearing on CNN in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and sunglasses shortly after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un exchanged greetings, Dennis Rodman became emotional when he was asked what it was like when he visited North Korea and returned home during the Obama administration.\u201cObama didn\u2019t even give me the time of day,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked him \u2014 I said I have something to say from North Korea. He just brushed me off. But that didn\u2019t deter me.\u201cI kept going back ... I showed my loyalty to this country, and I said to everybody, \u2018The door will open\u2019.\u201dREAD THE FULL STORY HERE.11.20amTrump describes meeting as \u2018tremendously successful\u2019Mr Trump has described the meeting as \u201ctremendously successful\u201d, with the pair now seated together in front of the media.\u201cWe will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt,\u201d the US President said.\u201cThe old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles on our way forward, but we overcame all of them and we are here today,\u201d added Kim.The body language between the pair has been notably warm. Mr Trump gave Kim a thumbs up as he said \u201cwe overcame all\u201d.They exchanged another handshake and touched each other on the arm.Both leaders have been openly smiling.11.05amKim and Trump meet face-to-faceIn a historic moment, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have met face-to-face for the first time, appearing before the media in front of the American and North Korean flags at the Capella Hotel in Singapore.At 9.04am, Mr Trump and Mr Kim approached from opposite sides of a white colonnade, shook hands and posed for photo. Kim could be heard saying \u201cNice to meet you, Mr President.\u201dThey then shook hands again and walked off stage together.The leaders are shortly expected to enter a meeting room one-on-one, accompanied solely by their translators, before moving into an expanded meeting later in the day.It is unknown how long the private meeting will last, but the White House schedule has given it roughly 45 minutes.The pair will begin a working lunch at 1.30pm (AEST) before Mr Trump addresses the media later this evening.11.00amKim and Trump arrive at summit siteKim Jong-un and Donald Trump have arrived at the summit site.The North Korean leader arrived first, got out of his vehicle and swiftly entered the Capella Hotel without smiling.Mr Trump arrived a few minutes later.10.45amLast-minute shock for TrumpJust minutes before his meeting with Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump tweeted that Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow has suffered a heart attack.The financial analyst, who currently serves under the US President, is now in Walter Reed Medical Centre.10.40amKim arrives at summit siteKim Jong-un has arrived at the Capella Hotel. The two leaders are now due to shake hands in 20 minutes \u2014 in what will be the first time in history a sitting US President has met with his North Korean counterpart.After meeting in front of the media for 15 minutes, they are expected to meet one-on-one, accompanied solely by their translators.According to CNN, a senior US official said the welcome will be \u201cwarm, polite, respectful\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s unknown if Mr Trump will smile as he usually does when greeting world leaders.10.15amKim Jong-un is now on the moveKim Jong-un has just departed for the meeting.He will make the 30-minute drive from the St Regis Hotel to Sentosa Island to begin historic negotiations with the US President.10.00amDonald Trump has left his hotelDonald Trump has now departed the Shangri-La Hotel and is en route to meet Kim Jong-un for the historic summit.He is headed to the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island with a police escort accompanying him.Mr Trump and Mr Kim will appear before the media for the first time together in less than an hour.In light of this significant occasion, the president ... just tweeted this:9.45amTwo words to listen out for after summitDonald Trump has vowed not to use the term \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d in the meeting with Kim Jong-un.In a joint press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe last week, the US leader said his use of the term this evening would be an indicator of how well the meeting went.\u201cMaximum pressure is absolutely in effect. We don\u2019t use the term anymore because we\u2019re going into a friendly negotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps after that negotiation I will be using it again. You\u2019ll know how well we do in the negotiation. If you hear me saying we\u2019re going to use \u201cmaximum pressure,\u201d you\u2019ll know the negotiation did not do well, frankly. There\u2019s no reason to say it.\u201dMr Trump has also claimed he will know within the \u201cfirst minute\u201d if Kim Jong-un is serious about giving up his nuclear arsenal.Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Canada last week, he said: \u201cI think within the first minute, I\u2019ll know.\u201d\u201cJust my touch, my feel, that\u2019s what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long will it take to figure out if they\u2019re serious? You know, the way they say you know if you\u2019re going to like somebody in the first five seconds, you ever hear that one? I think very quickly I\u2019ll know whether or not something good is going to happen.\u201d9.30amMike Pompeo departs for summitSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been snapped on his way to the summit.Addressing the media in Singapore yesterday, Mr Pompeo said the meeting is \u201ctruly a mission of peace\u201d.\u201cNorth Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearise, and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that our two leaders are sitting down face-to-face is a sign of the enormous potential to accomplish something that will immensely benefit both of our peoples and the entire world.\u201dHe said he is \u201chopeful\u201d the summit will \u201cset the conditions for future productive talks\u201d.Mr Pompeo will not be part of the initial meeting at 11.15am (AEST), which according to the White House will consist solely of Mr Trump, Mr Kim and their respective translators.8.45amTrump hits back at \u2018haters and losers\u2019Donald Trump has issued another tweet this morning \u2014 this time faulting the unnamed \u201chaters and losers\u201d who opposed the summit.He notes North Korea releasing a trio of US citizen hostages and halting missile tests after floating talks.Earlier this month, Kim Jong-un released three American hostages who had been held for months in the reclusive country. The move was considered a diplomatic gesture in the lead-up to the summit.In April Kim agreed to immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests.8.30amJulie Bishop weighs in on \u2018unorthodox\u2019 leadersAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop seems optimistic about the summit after speaking with Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.\u201cI was in contact with Vivian last night and he confirmed that both leaders are very upbeat and positive about a potential breakthrough at this meeting,\u201d she told Sunrise this morning. \u201cSo let\u2019s hope the summit is a success and we do see real concrete genuine steps towards peace on the Korean peninsula.\u201dMs Bishop said she\u2019s hopeful that after the \u201cgetting-to-know-you period\u201d, the pair can sit down and work out details for a second meeting. \u201cOur expectation should be that some progress will be made,\u201d she said.She wouldn\u2019t say whether the meeting made her nervous, but noted both leaders were \u201cunorthodox\u201d in their styles.8.15amDennis Rodman arrives for Trump-Kim summitFormer NBA star Dennis Rodman arrived in Singapore late yesterday ahead of the summit, saying he was \u201cexcited to be part of it\u201d.\u201cIt should go fairly well, but people should not expect so much for the first time,\u201d Rodman told reporters at the airport. \u201cThe doors are opening.\u201dThere has been no indication Rodman would be involved in any official talks at the summit, and last week, Mr Trump said he wasn\u2019t invited to Singapore.Rodman is one of a handful of Westerners to have visited reclusive North Korea and met Mr Kim, who is believed to be a huge basketball fan and occasional player. The former basketballer has called the North Korean leader his \u201cfriend for life\u201d.After his most recent five-day visit, he told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m just trying to open the door.\u201d\u2014 Reuters8.00amKim\u2019s sister spotted in SingaporeKim Yo-jong has been sighted in Singapore.The sister of the North Korean leader accompanied her brother to the historic summit, but reportedly flew in separately due to security concerns.In this video grab, she can be seen arriving before her brother\u2019s tour of the Sands Sky Park at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.Ms Kim was the first member of North Korea\u2019s ruling family to visit South Korea when she travelled to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February.7.30am\u2018Meetings going well and quickly\u2019It\u2019s 5.30am in Singapore, but US President Donald Trump is already up and tweeting.He just said everything seems to be running smoothly \u2014 with a touch of scepticism thrown in for good measure.7.20amNorth Koreans waking up to summit newsThis summit has been infiltrating your news feeds for weeks, but yesterday was the first time North Koreans heard their Supreme Leader had touched down in Singapore.According to CNN, crowds of North Koreans gathered outside a train station in Pyongyang to watch news of the summit broadcast onto a big screen, which included an update from famed North Korean news anchor Ri Chun Hee.\u201cThe historic first meeting and talks between the respected and beloved Comrade Supreme Leader and Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, will be held on the morning of June 12 in the Republic of Singapore,\u201d she announced, in her trademark excited tone.She noted the summit was a \u201chistorical first\u201d that is \u201cgarnering the attention and hopes of the entire world.\u201dThe announcement is a break from traditional coverage of Kim\u2019s summits, which usually only reaches North Koreans after the meetings have ended.7.00amEye-watering cost of the summitPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told local media the total cost of the summit would be $S20 million ($A19.7 million). Yowza.Security:Mr Lee said half of the figure would be spent on security, although the total amount is difficult to determine as much of the security consists of existing personnel that have been deployed around-the-clock.The security requirements are much higher than for previous meetings, with Mr Lee noting it\u2019s not just policemen but \u201call-round protection and in-depth protection \u2014 air, sea, land, against attack and against mishap\u201d.Accommodation:The entire five-star Capella luxury resort has been booked for the event. The most basic room at the resort goes for $S695, with the most expensive booking at almost $S13,000 per night.Hundreds of other hotel rooms have been booked for the actual event, including at the Shangri La hotel where Mr Trump is staying, and the St Regis where Mr Kim will be. An average night at these hotels is around $S535. Throw in hundreds of rooms for cameramen, personal security guards \u2026 you do the maths.Media:Accommodating the estimated 2500 journalists will also bear a large brunt of the costs \u2014 about $S5 million, according to the Ministry of Communications and Information. Singapore has built an international media centre for the event from scratch at the F1 Pit Building, including a stage and 2000 workstations, and they are bringing in satellite trucks and cable networks for the summit.But it\u2019s believed that the benefits will outweigh the costs. Mr Lee said it was a \u201cwhole of Singapore effort\u201d, noting that while ordinary Singaporeans had had their lives \u201ca little bit inconvenienced\u201d due to road closures and traffic jams, it was a \u201cnational effort\u201d.It wasn\u2019t easy to find a suitable location for the meeting, partly due to the difficulty of finding a country that had diplomatic relations with both sides.\u201cTherefore, when the two sides asked us to host the meeting, we cannot say no,\u201d Mr Lee said. \u201cWe have to step up \u2026 We can do a good job.\u201dJump back to topDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un met face-to-face for the first time in a historic summit in Singapore, before attending a private meeting and a working lunch with their advisers. Mr Trump then addressed the media in an extraordinary question and answer session that lasted almost an hour, before the leaders departed.A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.Find out more about our policy and your choices, including how to opt-out.News Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Kim made no explicit undertakings to give up his nuclear program and gave no timeline for dismantling it. Meanwhile, the President made a massive concession in promising to suspend military exercises with South Korea in the region.Kim\u2019s appalling human rights abuses and use of prison camps were skimmed over, and critics called Mr Trump \u201cnaive\u201d and \u201coutfoxed\u201d following his excited rhetoric about what had been achieved.While there was no mention of when the US might lift sanctions against the hermit kingdom, the Singapore meeting looked like a step forward for Kim in gaining the world\u2019s trust.The unprecedented meeting between a sitting US President and North Korean leader may have broken new symbolic ground \u2014 but it didn\u2019t achieve anything tangible on its most vital aims: DENUCLEARISATIONThe primary goal of the meeting was to persuade Kim to stop the nation\u2019s nuclear development and give up his nukes and ballistic missiles.The 34-year-old did none of this, simply vowing in the document to adhere to the promise he made to South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in at their April meeting.He \u201creaffirmed\u201d the same commitment North Korea has been making since 1992, in a pledge that appeared weaker than 2005\u2019s commitment to \u201cabandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.\u201d The regime tested its first nuclear device the following year, has conducted five underground tests since and is thought to have assembled at least two dozen warheads.The US wanted complete verifiable irreversible denuclearisation (CVID), which would require North Korea to allow international inspections and monitoring of sites \u2014 but there was no mention of Pyongyang welcoming United Nations nuclear inspectors back.Experts on the region have long voiced doubts Kim will ever give up his weapons, suspecting he may simply try to prolong negotiations and gain a relaxation of international sanctions.Mr Trump said in his press briefing after the summit that he was particularly pleased Kim had verbally agreed to destroy a nuclear missile testing site. \u201cIt was really the engine-testing site in addition to all of the other things that they\u2019ve agreed to do,\u201d he said.The 71-year-old seemed to be referring to a test stand crucial to developing mid-range, solid-fuel missiles, which North Korea razed in the country\u2019s northwest, as reported by 38 North last week.Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies emphasised that denuclearisation didn\u2019t mean disarmament in North Korea\u2019s eyes, but an initial step towards improving the relationship. \u201cI didn\u2019t lower my expectations quite far enough,\u201d Mr Lewis told CNN. \u201cI think the two parties are as far apart as they\u2019ve ever been.\u201dOlivia Enos, policy analyst at conservative Washington think tank the Heritage Foundation, told the Wall Street Journal the \u201cincredibly vague\u201d agreement did not bridge the gap between the two nations\u2019 understanding of denuclearisation. \u201cThis seems like just another feel-good statement similar to the one signed at the inter-Korean dialogue with little to no meat on the bones of where we go from here,\u201d she said. PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULAThe joint statement spoke of efforts \u201cto build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula,\u201d but no immediate end was called to the decades-long war, a result it had been hinted could transpire.This was again a much weaker commitment than a 1994 pledge to exchange diplomatic liaison offices, and a 2005 pledge to work towards a peace treaty.Mr Trump said US military exercises with South Korea in the region were \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d, mirroring the language used by the North in its propaganda. The President promised to suspend the \u201ctremendously expensive\u201d exercises as long as productive talks continued, saying he would remove US troops from the South \u201cat some point\u201d. His vow appeared to take Mr Moon\u2019s administration, US troops in Korea and even some in the Pentagon by surprise.Abraham Denmark from the Wilson Center in Washington said South Koreans would be \u201cunnerved\u201d and conservatives \u201capoplectic\u201d over the decision.The South\u2019s defence ministry said it was trying to determine the meaning of Mr Trump\u2019s words, while a national security official said \u201cnothing has changed.\u201d A spokesman for US Forces Korea said it had received no new guidance on joint military manoeuvres, including drills planned for the autumn. US military officers in South Korea were reportedly confused about what would happen next, and whether training would be cancelled, while other Asian allies of the US were also said to be nonplussed.\u201cThe North Koreans did not come with anything new,\u201d former CIA director Michael Hayden told CNN. \u201cThe new element is that we agreed to stop our annual exercise cycle with our South Korean allies. That\u2019s actually a pretty significant concession.\u201dIan Bremmer, from the Eurasia Group, told CBS: \u201cWhat we have is a freeze for freeze. The North Koreans are freezing their intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear tests and the Americans are freezing our military exercises with the South Koreans. That\u2019s exactly the formation the Chinese asked for over the past year and we said absolutely not.\u201d FRIENDSHIPSome suggested the greatest achievement of the summit was its symbolic step towards easing the stand-off between North Korea and the world.But others noted that it was Mr Trump himself who stoked tensions by calling Kim a \u201clittle rocket man\u201d and swearing to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the reclusive state last year.When he showed his counterpart a mock movie trailer heralding \u201ctwo men, two leaders, one destiny,\u201d he flattered \u201cChairman Kim\u2019s\u201d ego and pandered to his desire to transform his image on the global stage.Mr Trump called the North Korean leader a \u201ctalented\u201d man who \u201cloves his country very much.\u201dAsked how he squared this with Kim murdering family members, kidnapping civilians and abusing his own people, Mr Trump replied: \u201cI believe it\u2019s a rough situation over there, there\u2019s no question about it. It\u2019s rough in a lot of places, by the way.\u201dHe added: \u201cAnybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don\u2019t say it was nice, he ran it \u2014 very few people at that age, you can take one out of 10,000 probably who couldn\u2019t do it.\u201dThe US President said former prisoner Otto Warmbier \u201chad not died in vain\u201d, but added that the leaders had only discussed human rights \u201crelatively briefly\u201d because their talks focused on nuclear weapons.North Korea did commit to the \u201cimmediate repatriation\u201d of any remains it had identified of US soldiers and prisoners of war \u2014 a not insignificant goodwill gesture \u2014 but no enough for many. THE BOTTOM LINEFor Mr Trump, the meeting was \u201cfantastic\u201d, \u201cvery positive\u201d, \u201ctop of the line\u201d and \u201creally good.\u201dKim said the two leaders had overcome the \u201cold prejudices and practices\u201d that had been obstacles to moving forward.The US President said he was confident North Korea would start dismantling its nuclear arsenal \u201cvery quickly,\u201d adding that economic sanctions would remain in place until it did.He told reporters in Singapore after the summit that talks would continue, and he would possibly invite Kim to the White House and visit Pyongyang \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d\u201cI do trust him, yeah,\u201d the President told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America few hours after the meeting. \u201cHe really wants to do a great job for North Korea. He\u2019s de-nuking the whole place, and I think he\u2019s going to start very quickly. He really wants to do something I think terrific for their country.\u201dHowever, while he said Kim would begin the process soon, Mr Trump simultaneously played down the possibility of rapid progress.\u201c\u201cWe will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearisation. It takes a long time. \u201cScientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen. But despite that, once you start the process, it means it\u2019s pretty much over. Can\u2019t use them, that\u2019s the good news. That\u2019s going to start very soon.\u201dAs Mr Trump said earlier: \u201cI think he\u2019s going to do these things. I may be wrong. I may stand before you in six months and say, \u2018Hey, I was.\u2019\u201dBut, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever admit that. I\u2019ll find some kind of excuse.\u201d emma.reynolds@news.com.au | @emmareynA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Watch their first official remarks to to one another here.THEY shook hands, ate lunch, posed for photos and talked \u2014 and as Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un did so, the world waited and watched enthralled.The meeting between the two leaders was billed as the summit of the century. Whether or not it lives up to that hype will largely be determined by what follows after the historic meeting in Singapore in the coming weeks and months.President Trump was in his usual form when he spoke with media for almost an hour in an extraordinary media conference. He was confident of a breakthrough in US-NK relations, but hedged his bets somewhat and placed much of the onus on his counterpart\u2019s shoulders.Mr Trump was particularly impressed when Kim vowed to destroy a nuclear missile testing site.\u201cI think he\u2019ll do it. I really believe that \u2014 otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be doing this \u2026 It was really the engine-testing site in addition to all of the other things that they\u2019ve agreed to do,\u201d he said.But time will tell.Speaking to hundreds of journalists, Mr Trump made an extraordinarily frank admission.\u201cI may stand before you in six months and say, \u2018Hey, I was wrong.\u2019 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever admit that, but I\u2019ll find some kind of excuse,\u201d he said, to the amusement of his audience.The deal which Mr Trump and Chairman Kim agreed has already been criticised for lacking detail or a time-frame on when anything will be achieved by. Instead, it sought to establish new relations between the two countries.But Kim has committed to \u201cfully\u201d move towards denuclearisation. In return, the US and South Korea will abandon their military exercisesKim and Mr Trump spent almost 40 minutes of their summit with only translators, which is not normal diplomatic protocol. They were then joined by members of their own delegations for an extended bilateral.The remains of prisoners of war from the 1950-1953 Korean War would also be repatriated \u2014 something Mr Trump said Kim agreed to very easily.The US leader paid tribute to American student Otto Warmbier, who died of a brain damage after being arrested in North Korea. He said his death was not in vain and was a catalyst for the summit.After lunch came a chance to pose for a picture many thought they would never see. On one side was the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), a ruthless dictator, and the other the reality show host turned US President.They shook hands and smiled. The handshake lasted 13 seconds and was without any of the vigorous antics other world leaders have endured from Mr Trump.Nothing could ever be taken for granted or assumed, Mr Trump said \u2014 but he had been a deal maker \u201cmy whole life\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s my thing\u201d.He added: \u201cYou can\u2019t ensure anything. All I can say is that they want to make a deal. That\u2019s what I do. My whole life has been deals. I\u2019ve done great at it. That\u2019s what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn\u2019t. A lot of politicians don\u2019t.\u201dThere were plenty of sledges of former US presidents, from Bill Clinton \u2014 who famously gave North Korea billions to abandon their nuclear program \u2014 to Barack Obama, who Mr Trump implied had allowed the situation to fester.\u201cThis really could have been done I think easier a long time ago, but I know \u2014 I just feel very strongly, my instinct, my ability or talent, they want to make a deal and making a deal is a great thing for the world,\u201d said the President.Many doubted the pair would ever meet. Until last week the meeting was in doubt and it was only a few short months ago that Mr Trump derided Kim as \u201crocket man\u201d for his attempts to establish nuclear missiles.But the US President appeared to be satisfied the ends justified the means, acknowledging the summit might not have happened without the fiery rhetoric.\u201cWell at that time we needed perhaps fire and fury because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States and certainly Japan wasn\u2019t going to allow it either,\u201d he said. \u201cJapan is right next door.\u201dHe did not repeat the threats yesterday \u2014 in public or private. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough thing to talk about because I don\u2019t want to be threatening. They understood that.\u201dAt his media conference, he faced several questions about what exactly the US got from the meeting. He claimed he gave up nothing \u2014 and insisted the crippling sanctions would remain.\u201cThe sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor. Sanctions played a big role but they\u2019ll come off at that point. I hope it\u2019s gonna be soon. But they\u2019ll come off \u2014 as you know and as I have said, the sanctions right now remain but at a certain point I actually look forward to taking them off and they\u2019ll come off when we know we\u2019re down the road.\u201dIn other words, it would be business as usual until North Korea made moves towards denuclearisation.\u201cWe talked about the guarantees and we talked about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. This is the document that we just signed,\u201d said Mr Trump.The wait may not be a long one. Kim has promised \u201ccomplete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\u201d in the document which both leaders signed at the end of their meeting.\u201cToday we have had a historic meeting, we decided to leave the past behind,\u201d Kim said through an interpreter.\u201cThe world will see a major change. I would like to express my gratitude to President Trump for making this meeting happen.\u201dMr Trump added: \u201cA lot of goodwill went into this, a lot of work, a lot of preparation. We\u2019re very proud of what took place today.\u201cWe are prepared to start a new history and we are ready to write a new chapter between our two nations.\u201cWe have developed a very special bond.\u201dAsked how he could praise Kim as \u201ctalented\u201d when he had along history of violent crimes against his people, Mr Trump responded: \u201cHe is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don\u2019t say it was nice, he ran it \u2014 very few people at that age [could do it] you can take one out of 10,000 probably who could.\u201dMany commentators contrasted his new-found affection for Kim to the contempt he showed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the G7 meeting at the weekend. He branded Mr Trudeau \u201cweak\u201d after he gave a news conference about US \u201cbullying\u201d.\u201cWhen I got to the plane, I think Justin didn\u2019t know Air Force one has about 20 televisions, and I see the television and he\u2019s giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. I say, \u2018Push him around? We just shook hands.\u2019 It was very friendly.\u201dHe continued by saying he thought his friendship with Mr Trudeau was strong \u2014 but so was his bond with Kim.\u201cI think I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now, I really do. I hope it\u2019s good because if it is we\u2019re going to solve a very big problem.\u201dAfter their meeting, Kim said to Mr Trump through an interpreter: \u201cMany people in the world will think of this as a form of fantasy \u2026 from a science fiction movie.\u201dFor once, maybe the North Korean leader was right about something.andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

So how did we get here? US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Singapore on Sunday for an unprecedented summit, with Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal at the top of the agenda and the US president calling it a 'one-time shot' at peace.A YEAR ago, it would\u2019ve been hard to imagine Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump were about to meet face-to-face.These were the days when we heard of \u201cbig buttons\u201d rather than \u201cbig letters\u201d, test missiles were being launched over Japan, and a much-parodied but alarming back-and-forth series of threats were being exchanged through Twitter and state media.Now we see Mr Kim and his South Korean counterpart hugging and laughing in public, a nuclear test site being demolished in the presence of invited foreign journalists, and the meeting of the century about to take place between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore.Here\u2019s a look back on the major events that led up to this moment.***2016***NOVEMBER Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.***2017***JANUARYKim Jong-un warns that his country is making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.He also says North Korea will continue to bolster its weapons as long as the United States remains hostiles and continues its joint military exercises with South Korea.APRILMr Trump orders a missile strike on Syria and reports that the US would \u201cprevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons\u201d.North Korea holds a massive parade to mark the 105th anniversary of Kim Il-sung \u2014 and to display what appears to be long-range and submarine-based missiles.JULYNorth Korea fires its first ever IBM over Japan, marking a sharp escalation in tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons.Experts say the missile has a range of about 10,000 kilometres \u2014 far enough to strike the west coast of the US and beyond.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull publicly condemns the threat, calling on all nations to impose their harshest sanctions on Pyongyang, while singling out China as the country with the most dire ability to do this.AUGUSTMr Trump threatens North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d if it doesn\u2019t stop threatening the US.

The North Korean leader \u2014 who rarely travels \u2014 was surrounded by security guards, a media scrum and cheering crowds as he embarked on an evening tour of attractions on the city\u2019s waterfront.Kim\u2019s motorcade headed to the world-famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, before he and his sister Kim Yo-jong visited the Esplanade, Jubilee Bridge and the Gardens by the Bay, where the reclusive leader posed for selfies with Singaporean government officials.Mr Trump met with Mr Lee on Monday and attended a working lunch, telling the Singaporean PM: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very interesting meeting in particular tomorrow, and I think things can work out very nicely.\u201dThe US President was presented with an early birthday cake and blew out the candles ahead of his 72nd on June 14, before returning to the Shangri-La Hotel to work.The US delegation at the larger meeting on Tuesday will include Mr Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and National Security Advisor John Bolton.Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Ambassador Sung Kim, and National Security Council Senior Director for Asia Matt Pottinger will attend the working lunch.Former NBA star Dennis Rodman arrived in Singapore at around midnight, hours before Tuesday morning\u2019s summit. The White House said he would play no official role in negotiations, but the athlete has promised to \u201cgive whatever support is needed\u201d to his \u201cfriends\u201d Mr Trump and Kim.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier seemed to play down expectations for the meeting, which Mr Trump had predicted could yield an instant end to the Korean War.Mr Trump called the leaders of South Korea and Japan in advance of the summit but South Korean President Moon Jae-in would have to be present if a declaration ending the conflict was to be signed, and he has no current plans to join Mr Trump and Kim.Mr Pompeo suggested the summit might have little concrete success other than to pave the way for further meetings.The Secretary of State told reporters the US was prepared to take action to provide North Korea with \u201csufficient certainty\u201d that denuclearisation \u201cis not something that ends badly for them.\u201dHe would not say whether that included the possibility of withdrawing troops from the Korean Peninsula, but stressed the discussions were \u201cradically different than ever before\u201dHe said the US was \u201cprepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique, than America\u2019s been willing to provide previously.\u201dMr Trump has already made it clear the summit is a \u201cone-time shot\u201d and said he would know within minutes of meeting Kim whether an agreement was going to be reached or not. But he also said the summit would be part of a \u201cprocess\u201d.He told reporters he hadn\u2019t prepared \u201cvery much\u201d because, \u201cI will know, just my touch, my feel. That\u2019s what I do.\u201dAsked on Saturday about his aims, he said: \u201cWell, I think the minimum would be relationship. You would start at least a dialogue, because, you know, as a deal person, I have done very well with deals.\u201dThe North has faced crippling international sanctions as it has developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.There is deep scepticism over whether Kim will easily abandon his nuclear weapons program, but experts hope diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the Hermit Kingdom.With the summit already dramatically cancelled and reinstated, anything appears to be possible from this clash of two unpredictable men.Mr Trump also made an unexpected exit from the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, insulting host Justin Trudeau and removing the US from the group statement.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

There are plans for extensive road closures and police will line the streets around the venue, expected to be the lavish Shangri-La or Marina Bay Sands hotels.Talking points, locations for photographs, catering and potential joint statements all have to be meticulously planned \u2014 the room must have two entrances, so both can enter at the same time. An inappropriate background or unsuitable gift could be disastrous for the tense talks between two men who only recently called each other \u201cdotard\u201d and \u201clittle rocket man\u201d as they exchanged nuclear threats.Mr Kim is expected to use Soviet-era aircraft to carry him, staff, security and his limousine on his longest official journey, which will pose all kinds of challenges for the impoverished country.There has been intense negotiation over who will pay for the North Korean leader\u2019s preferred $8000 room at the high-end Fullerton Hotel, with the United States, Singapore and an anti-nukes non-profit agreeing to contribute.Agreeing upon a satisfactory menu will be a tricky balance: the US President is known as a non-drinker who favours a reliable burger, even when visiting Asian countries. Mr Kim enjoys wine and brought Pyongyang cold noodles to an April 27 summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Restaurants and bars are treating the event as a tourism opportunity, with Escobar serving up a blue, bourbon-based cocktail named the \u201cTrump\u201d and a red \u201cKim\u201d drink containing Korean spirit soju, as well as organising a \u201cUS-North Korea showdown\u201d where customers who order a tray of 20 shots compete in a game of \u201crock, paper, scissors\u201d while wearing gloves emblazoned with the countries\u2019 flags.SPIES, SECRET SERVICE AND EXTERNAL THREATSThe North Korean leader was memorably pictured with 12 bodyguards running alongside his car when meeting his counterpart from the South. Even more extreme security measures are being put in place for the Trump talks, with both leaders known to be paranoid about their safety.A senior North Korean adviser was seen by reporters reading a briefing paper on a flight to Singapore that said, \u201cin order to guarantee the results of the US-North Korea summit meeting, guarantee the safety of Chairman Kim Jong-un above all else\u201d.The Secret Service, North Korean officials and Singaporean security teams are consulting to ensure the meeting between the erratic leaders goes to plan, with the discussion holding immense significance for global politics.Mr Trump has repeatedly implied he may have already spoken with Mr Kim, but it\u2019s unclear if this is the case. The pair have met before.They are also working to prevent spies infiltrating with talks, with China and Russia both having an outside interest, Politico reports. The White House is currently planning a controversial potential summit between the US President and Vladimir Putin.Russia\u2019s foreign minister on Thursday met with Mr Kim in Pyongyang and passed on Mr Putin\u2019s \u201cwarmest regards and best wishes\u201d for North Korea\u2019s \u201cbig endeavours\u201d on the Korean Peninsula, inviting the regime\u2019s leader to visit Moscow.Mr Trump, who agreed to reinstate the meeting after a visit from North Korean envoy Kim Yong-chol with a large letter, will also discuss Syria, Ukraine and wider arms-control with his counterpart. On Sunday, North Korean state media reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plans to visit Mr Kim in Pyongyang. It would be the first meeting between Mr Kim and another head of state in the North Korean capital.Just as North Korea has angered the international community over its nuclear weapons program, Syria has been widely condemned for its brutality in the country\u2019s civil war.United Nations monitors have accused the North of co-operating with Syria on chemical weapons, a charge it denies.Mr Assad praised the \u201coutstanding political calibre and wise leadership of His Excellency Kim Jong-un\u201d and said he was certain the North Korean leader would \u201cachieve the final victory and realise the reunification of Korea without fail\u201d.WHAT WILL THEY ACHIEVE?The summit itself is largely a symbolic gesture \u2014 but a hugely important one for diplomacy.Advance negotiations are already taking place to discuss whether North Korea will agree to the \u201ccomplete verifiable irreversible disarmament (CVID)\u201d that the US wants.Many think this unlikely, with Mr Kim making it clear he does not plan to give up his weapons and his aggressive rhetoric already caused the meeting to flounder, with Mr Trump showing how easily he could pull the plug.What North Korea does desperately need is an improvement in its economic fortunes. This is Mr Kim\u2019s chance to persuade the US and other countries to engage in joint endeavours and end sanctions.Mr Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that the summit would be just \u201ca beginning\u201d in \u201ca process\u201d towards persuading the North to completely stop developing nuclear weapons. The Kim administration is expected to draw out the complex negotiations while it continues to develop those capabilities.Tufts University Korean Studies professor Sung-Yoon Lee told USA Today  Mr Kim may already have won just by agreeing to talk about nuclear weapons and buying himself \u201ctime and money\u201d.She said the negotiations could undercut US efforts to persuade China and others into joining in sanctions on North Korea over its nukes, predicting a \u201cpolitical and economic bonanza\u201d for the regime.There may also be progress on another front. Some experts say an end to the Korean War could come as soon as a day after the Trump-Kim summit, following a recent surge in talks between the North and South aimed at ending the decades-old conflict.The US President said a formal end to the war would be on the negotiating table at his meeting with Mr Kim. Seoul-based security expert Cho Sung Ryul told  The Korea Herald that the discussion would be more about symbolism than a decision with legal effect, but was necessary to ease North Korea\u2019s concerns over security in the denuclearisation process until the current armistice agreement was replaced by a peace treaty.But the war of words has not ended. North Korea on Sunday again condemned South Korea\u2019s upcoming military drills with the US, saying they were contrary to the agreement both countries signed at the April summit.Seoul plans to take part in the combined drills of the 20-nation Rim of the Pacific Exercise and Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which North Korea sees as a trial for invading its territory.\u201cDialogue and confrontation, and peace and war exercises can never go hand-in-hand,\u201d read an editorial in North Korean official daily newspaper Rodong.Mr Kim also defied Washington when he complained of \u201cUS hegemonism\u201d in a meeting with Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday.Whatever happens in eight days\u2019 time, the summit marks a new era for North Korea after Mr Kim threw off the \u201cHermit Kingdom\u201d legacy and embarked on a global diplomacy exercise in 2018.

So we look nice and handsome and thin, and perfect.\u201dThe comment was translated for Kim and the camera zoomed in just in time to catch the North Korean leader looking shocked, then appalled.Mr Trump may simply have been feeling jovial, but Kim appeared to take this as a gibe about his weight.Viewers called Kim\u2019s unamused expression \u201chilarious\u201d and compared the reaction shot to a political satire or scene from The Office.Many wondered whether the \u201cfat joke\u201d directed at the notoriously aggressive leader would derail the entire encounter, since Kim is not known for his tolerance. But the pair later released an amiable joint statement after the historic summit, and were seen warmly bidding each other goodbye.Some questioned whether the good humour had been lost in translation, although Kim is believed to be a capable English speaker.The US President has previously said of the 34-year-old: \u201cWhy would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me \u2018old,\u2019 when I would NEVER call him \u2018short and fat?\u2019\u201dKim said to be sensitive about his weight and was infuriated by 2014 reports that he had broken his ankles after ballooning to 130 kilograms by eating too much Swiss cheese.Both leaders are exceptionally conscious of appearance, with Mr Trump suspected of pretending he is taller than he really is to avoid being classified as \u201cobese\u201d on the Body Mass Index.The comparisons didn\u2019t stop at The Office, with one Twitter user placing the theme song from Curb Your Enthusiasm over the top for dramatic effect:The 71-year-old\u2019s doctor\u2019s letter claims he is 6\u20193\u201d and 108kg, placing him just under the \u201cobese\u201d category. But questions were raised after photos of the G7 leaders standing in a row showed Mr Trump was a fraction shorter than Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is 6\u20192\u201d.Kim also tried to boost his stature by wearing his custom Cuban heels, which have a secret stack to give the illusion the 5\u20197\u201d leader is not significantly shorter than his counterparts.Before their attempt at improving relations with the Singapore meeting, Kim called Mr Trump a \u201cdotard\u201d and the President retorted that he was \u201clittle rocket man\u201d. While they now seem to have reached a tentative truce, they walk a fine line between exchanging wild insults and achieving real peace.But with the promise of more meetings to come, we can only wait to see if there are more explosive moments between these hot-headed men.Trump, Kim Exchange Praise at Singapore SummitA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

So how did it report on the most significant meeting of Mr Kim\u2019s life?  HOW NORTH KOREA COVERED THE SUMMITKCNA\u2019s coverage of the historic meeting between the American and North Korean leaders was uncharacteristically warm.\u201cNoting that he is pleased to sit face-to-face with President Trump and the U.S. side\u2019s delegation, Chairman Kim Jong Un highly praised the president\u2019s will and enthusiasm to resolve matters in a realistic way through dialogue and negotiations, away from the hostility-woven past,\u201d the hermit nation\u2019s state media report said.It repeatedly referred to them as \"the two top leaders\u201d, and notes that after the working lunch, the \u201ctop leaders had a walk, deepening friendly feelings\u201d.\u201cChairman Kim Jong Un and President Trump expressed expectation and belief that the two countries which have lived in the quagmire of hostility, distrust and hatred would pass the unhappy past over and dynamically advance toward an excellent and proud future beneficial to each other and another new era, the era of the DPRK-U.S. cooperation would open up.\u201d BIG DETAIL MISSING FROM REPORTSThe denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was the main end goal for the United States in meeting with Kim Jong-un.But the KCNA report made just two fleeting references to it \u2014 neither of which included a direct pledge to actually do so.The first reference states: \u201cKim Jong Un said in order to achieve peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and realise its denuclearisation, the two countries should commit themselves to refraining from antagonising with each other out of mutual understanding, and take legal and institutional steps to guarantee it.\u201dThe second states: \u201cKim Jong Un and Trump had the shared recognition to the effect that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\u201dNeither of these statements suggests the two leaders reached a concrete agreement that will ensure North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.Rather, it says the two countries should maintain a peaceful relationship if the prospect of denuclearisation is ever to be realised.In a separate report, KCNA acknowledges the joint text signed by the two leaders, which specifies four key agreements between the US and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).Again, this doesn\u2019t actually specify a concrete plan for denuclearisation, but rather just reiterates a symbolic deal established between North and South Korea in April.Here\u2019s what the document said \u2014 and a brief explanation of what each point means: 1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the people of the two counties for peace and prosperity.This serves as an acknowledgment that the US and North Korea are seeking to leave their hostilities behind and move towards peace. 2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.Until now, the US and South Korea have had an alliance against North Korea and its nuclear regime. This means the US and North Korea will move towards dialogue and pursue an end to their hostile relationship. 3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.The Panmunjom Declaration was adopted by North and South Korea during the 2018 inter-Korean Summit in April. It stated that the two sides would agree to work together to end the Korean War and bring about a new era of peace, including denuclearisation. This point serves as a reiteration of that. 4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.The United States and North Korea will work together to identify the remains of American Korean War casualties \u2014 a move veterans advocates have been pushing for. Over 7000 American service members from the war remain unaccounted for.A third KCNA article acknowledges Mr Kim received a letter from Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.The letter congratulated the leader for the \u201csuccessful conclusion of the historic summit meeting\u201d and said Singapore believed it was an \u201chonour\u201d to sponsor him and Mr Trump.Mr Lee also wrote that he hopes to meet Mr Kim again in the near future.

Sightsee, of course. That's exactly what Kim Jong Un did, just 12 hours before his scheduled sit-down with US President Donald Trump this afternoon to discuss his nuclear programme and the prospect of officially ending the Korean War. The Singaporean hosts seemed to be daring Kim to think big, to dream of the kind of glittering future his country could have if it opens up to the outside world, as they took him on the late-evening tour. The outing was in stark contrast to Trump's itinerary. The President went to the US Embassy after having lunch with Singapore's Prime Minister and was not seen again for the rest of the day. But soon after 9 pm local time (1am NZT), Kim headed out of his five-star hotel and set out first for Gardens by the Bay, a huge open space on Singapore's waterfront with striking Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories. There, Singapore's Foreign Minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, took a selfie with Kim and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung in front of a wall of flowers. Kim, in the middle, was smiling and looking directly into the camera. \"Jalanjalan,\" Balakrishnan wrote on Twitter, using the Malay term for going for a walk. Then the group crossed over Jubilee Bridge, an architecturally impressive pedestrian walkway over the Singapore River, to Marina Bay Sands, a breathtaking building comprising three towers with an enormous boat-shaped structure on the top. The hotel and casino complex is owned by Las Vegas Sands, the company run by Sheldon Adelson, one of Trump's biggest donors. Kim smiled and waved at the crowd gathered at the entrance to Marina Bay Sands, some of whom cheered and clapped for him. The North Korean leader was accompanied by his sister and close aide, Kim Yo Jong, as well as cameramen for North Korea's state television channel, suggesting that his city tour will be featured on North Korea's news broadcasts. Guests at the C\u00e9 La Vi bar on the Marina Bay Sands' tiered 57th floor realised something was up soon after 8 pm, when the deck on the level below was cleared and the area secured. Around 9.30 pm, in swept about 50 bodyguards, according to staff, with Kim in the middle. He stood on the 56th floor's rooftop \"Sky Park\" looking over the city, with its skyscrapers topped by illuminated Citibank and HSBC signs. Kim was there for about 10 minutes, according to staff and patrons. \"I wondered why he was here. Doesn't he have a meeting in the morning?\" asked a British businessman drinking beer on the edge of the roof deck, the perfect spot to watch Kim on his tour. The staff weren't told who was coming to the bar, but they guessed. It was \"scary,\" said one. After Kim and his entourage left, cleaners wiped away fingerprints from the glass barriers, according to local reports. Singapore is a comfortable place for North Koreans. It is in Asia, and it has been ruled by one family for almost 60 years. It has strict rules, although nowhere near as strict as North Korea's. And its astonishing economic transformation offers a model for a strong developing state. Because the island nation is so relatable, the Singaporean nongovernmental organisation Choson Exchange has brought more than 100 North Koreans here over the past nine years, teaching them about finance and market economics and development. \"Bringing North Koreans to Singapore is about telling them that if they take the right steps, someday they will be a prosperous global city, too,\" said Geoffrey See, the Singaporean who started Choson Exchange. \"And this economic story is reflected in the infrastructure in the bay area, with the skyscrapers lining the business district, the Marina Bay Sands hotel crowning the skyline and the Esplanade flanking the bay.\" In fact, See has taken his North Korean groups on almost exactly the same city tour that Kim undertook, although - unlike Kim - the other North Koreans stopped for a drink beside the infinity pool atop the Marina Bay Sands boat. Singapore's Government appeared to be sending a signal to Kim about the possibilities for his own future, See said. \"I would not be surprised that part of the message the U.S. has for North Korea in bringing them here is to say, 'If you take the right steps tomorrow, this could be the global prosperous city or country you can be in a generation,' \" he said."}{"head": "   New Zealand Herald  ", "classes": [], "content": "Not to worry, you can get back on track by heading to our homepage or other sections of the New Zealand Herald website below."}{"head": "   New Zealand Herald  ", "classes": [], "content": "Not to worry, you can get back on track by heading to our homepage or other sections of the New Zealand Herald website below."}{"head": " Why Trump was among the winners at the Singapore summit  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " In the hours after the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, experts and pundits on social media have mostly opined that the US 'got nothing' out of the meeting. An obvious case can be made for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his patron China as the chief winners. The concessions on US side were easy to see: - The US 'normalised' and 'legitimised' Kim by presenting him as an equal to President Donald Trump on the world stage. The twined flag arrangement, the handshake choreography in the meet and greet were no different to how a US president would treat a typical visiting foreign leader at the White House. The pair held talks with aides, a working lunch and signed a declaration at the end. Yet Kim is the dictator of a tightly-controlled, and until recently isolated, rogue nation - now with nukes. - The US dialled back on its demand for a show of faith from North Korea on its nuclear programme, with no timetable now given for disarmament and just a vague goal of denuclerisation. To North Korea that term includes the US lifting its security blanket from the peninsula. - And Trump spoke afterwards about wanting to remove all US troops from South Korea. He also agreed to halt US-South Korea military drills, following the Chinese plan of a 'freeze for a freeze' after North Korea halted its nuclear and missile testing. - After just a day of meetings, Trump spoke of his \"trust\" in Kim and \"very special bond\" with the North Korean leader. Political analyst Josh Rogin tweeted: \"The more Trump talks about the deal, the worse it sounds. US stops exercises, pledges to remove troops, no new sanctions, all in exchange for vague promises of denuclearisation.\" Colin Kahl, former national security advisor to Joe Biden, tweeted: \"Critics of the Iran deal blasted Obama for giving up maximum leverage for a less-than-perfect agreement, even though the 156-page deal provided long-term, verifiable nuclear constraints. Trump has now given up maximum pressure on North Korea for 1 page of empty promises.\" The Atlantic Council's Daniel Fried wrote: \"China and Kim are winners. We are now operating within their policy framework: de facto nuclear status quo (which favours North Korea), suspension of US military exercises (ditto) , and de facto gradual weakening of sanctions, the leverage which the US administration deployed, developed, and now risks squandering.\" What this means for the US, North Korea and countries in the region is uncertain for now. There will be pushback from South Korea, the Pentagon and within the Republican Party over the pledges to stop military exercises and pullout troops. It is hard to see any troop withdrawal happening in this Trump term with the upcoming US election timetable of the Midterms in November and presidential campaigning next year. The unusual move to hold a summit with a despot, freshly part of the nuclear club, has instantly created precedents. Trump has even promised to invite Kim to the White House. But despite the disgust at 'normalisation,' regular talks and ties with North Korea appear to be a healthier and safer option than keeping the country at arms' length. It's a process that has to happen if the country is to evolve towards 'normality'. The question of what Trump's foreign policy is doing to the old system of diplomatic alliances in North America, Europe and Asia has been in sharp focus since the G7. As a businessman he seems to see little difference between old friends and foes, calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \"dishonest and weak\" just days before Kim was apparently \"very talented\". There's no consistency of position, just a whiplash of shifting stances. Fried writes: \"Tactical unpredictability can be a tool. Strategic unreliability is a liability.\" Rivals Russia and China gain more from Trump than the EU countries and Japan. The past counts for nothing. Fried adds: \"The administration can make up some of the losses by negotiating a serious framework for \"complete, verifiable, and irreversible\" North Korean disarmament, maintaining the sanctions in place and enforced until that deal is done and implemented, and postponing until after peace on the peninsula is secured any substantial change to the robust US-South Korea security relationship.\" For now, the US has diplomatic headaches with regional allies emerging from the summit. And for Trump himself? Trump said he told Kim: \"You can have the best hotels in the world. Think of it from a real estate perspective.\" A future Trump Tower Pyongyang? Once again he showed with his showmanship how difficult an opponent he will be in the next presidential election, with his added advantages of incumbency and a well-performing economy. He is an effective, easy-to-digest messenger who can charm when he wants to. He is trying to sell Kim and North Korea to his domestic audience. A CNN poll last month showed 77 per cent approval for the Trump-Kim meeting. It gives him a chance to reach beyond core supporters. People want a 'normal,' unthreatening North Korea. For people who don't chase the nuance in such events and absorb them via video, photos and soundbites, the summit may have looked like a bold move that paid off for Trump. It may have looked like a win, a foreign policy achievement for the dealmaker, something that no president had done before - as Trump made sure to emphasise."}{"head": "   New Zealand Herald  ", "classes": [], "content": "Not to worry, you can get back on track by heading to our homepage or other sections of the New Zealand Herald website below."}{"head": "   New Zealand Herald  ", "classes": [], "content": "Not to worry, you can get back on track by heading to our homepage or other sections of the New Zealand Herald website below."}{"head": " Trump, Kim converge on Singapore ahead of high-stakes summit  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un converged on this island city-state yesterday ahead of one of the most unusual and highly anticipated summits in recent world history, a sit-down meant to settle a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. Trump descended from Air Force One into the steamy Singapore night, greeting officials and declaring he felt \"very good,\" before he was whisked away to his hotel, driving along a route lined with police and photo-snapping onlookers. Trump travelled to Singapore from Canada, where he met with other world leaders whose countries make up the Group of Seven. Hours earlier, a jet carrying Kim landed. After shaking hands with the Singapore foreign minister, Kim sped through the streets in a limousine, two large North Korean flags fluttering on the hood, surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows and bound for the luxurious and closely guarded St. Regis Hotel. He and Trump are set to meet tomorrow morning in the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting US president. The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Kim smiled broadly last night as he met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. \"The entire world is watching the historic summit between (North Korea) and the United States of America, and thanks to your sincere efforts ... we were able to complete the preparations for the historic summit,\" Kim told Lee through an interpreter. Trump is set to meet with Lee today. Trump has said he hopes to make a legacy-defining deal for the North to give up its nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting. The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep scepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the North. US and North Korean officials are set to meet today in Singapore to make final preparations for tomorrow's meeting. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Sung Kim, the US ambassador to the Philippines who has taken the lead on policy negotiations with the North, will hold a \"working group\" with a North Korean delegation. The North Korean autocrat's every move will be followed by 3000 journalists who have converged on Singapore, and by gawkers around the world, up until he shakes hands with Trump tomorrow. It's a reflection of the intense global curiosity over Kim's sudden turn to diplomacy in recent months after a slew of North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year raised serious fears of war. Part of the interest in tomorrow's summit is simply because Kim has had limited appearances on the world stage. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his father's death in late 2011 \u2014 traveling twice to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarised Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea, respectively. But it's Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons that gives his meeting with Trump such high stakes. The meeting was initially meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-you session. Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty. It's unclear what Trump and Kim might decide tomorrow. Pyongyang has said it is willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with reliable security assurances and other benefits. But many say this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and given that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to his holding onto unchecked power. Any nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea's willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country's warheads and nuclear fuel, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea's reluctance to open its doors to outsiders. Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea. The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, but the war technically continues today because instead of a difficult-to-negotiate peace treaty, military officers for the US-led United Nations, North Korea and China signed an armistice that halted the fighting. The North may see a treaty \u2014 and its presumed safety assurances from Washington \u2014 as its best way of preserving the Kim family dynasty. The ensuing recognition as a \"normal country\" could then allow sanctions relief, and later international aid and investment. Just meeting with Trump will also give Kim a recognition North Korea has long sought, setting him up as global player and the leader of a country worthy of respect. - AP"}{"head": " Isolated Kim takes big gamble leaving home for Trump summit  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " SINGAPORE (AP) \u2014 Spare a moment, as you anticipate one of the most unusual summits in modern history, to consider North Korea's leader as he left the all-encompassing bubble of his locked-down stronghold of Pyongyang on Sunday and stepped off a jet onto Singapore soil for his planned sit-down with President Donald Trump on Tuesday. There's just no recent precedent for the gamble Kim Jong Un is taking. As far as we know, his despot father only traveled out of the country by train, and rarely at that, because of fears of assassination. Kim, up until his recent high-profile summit with South Korea's president on the southern side of their shared border, has usually hunkered down behind his vast propaganda and security services, or made short trips to autocrat-friendly China. While Singapore has authoritarian leanings, it is still a thriving bastion of capitalism and wealth, and Kim will be performing his high-stakes diplomatic tight-rope walk in front of 3,000 international journalists, including a huge contingent from the ultra-aggressive South Korean press \u2014 sometimes referred to by Pyongyang as \"reptile media\" \u2014 two of whom were arrested by Singapore police investigating a report of trespassing at the residence of the North Korean ambassador. While he famously attended school in Switzerland, traveling this far as supreme leader is an entirely different matter for someone used to being the most revered, most protected, most deferred to human in his country of 25 million. Kim is, essentially, upsetting two decades of carefully choreographed North Korean statecraft and stepping into the unknown. There's wild speculation about how Kim will perform on the world stage, although one question was answered Sunday: His grim-faced, well-muscled bodyguards marched alongside his armored limousine at one point in Singapore, just as they did when he met the South Korean leader in April. But amid the curiosity is an even more fundamental question: Why is he taking this risk at all? Here's a look: ___ THE LOGISTICS First the nuts and bolts: How do you protect what many North Koreans consider their single most precious resource, the third member of the Kim family to rule and a direct descendant of North Korea's worshipped founder Kim Il Sung? Hundreds of North Korean security experts have no doubt been up nights wondering how to safeguard Kim Jong Un since Trump shocked the world by accepting the North's invitation to meet. Kim arrived Sunday on a Chinese plane, not his official plane, which is called \"Chammae-1\" and named after the goshawk, North Korea's national bird. Kim may have shipped over the massive bulletproof and fireproof limousine that became a social media sensation when Kim was shown being driven across the border between the Koreas during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in April, with a dozen staunch bodyguards encircling the auto. He could be seen speeding through Singapore on Sunday in a black limousine adorned with large North Korean flags. Singapore's The Straits Times reported earlier this month that the Singapore government declared that four black BMW sedans with armored bodies that can withstand gunshots, explosives and grenades were exempt from certain traffic rules through June 30. The newspaper said the vehicles weren't from a local authorized dealer, which suggests the cars were brought in specifically for the summit and may be used by Kim. Kim's bodyguards traveled with him, providing trusted protection to back up local Singapore security who were controlling the perimeter and crowds, One benefit of Singapore from the North Korean point of view is that there will probably not be any anti-North Korea protests during Kim's stay. \"Singapore is like a police state. How can such rallies take place there? Anyone involved in rallies would be arrested,\" said Choi Kang, vice president of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies. Kim arrived Sunday at the St. Regis hotel, where his close aide has been based as he leads a North Korean advance team arranging security and logistics details. South Korea's Hankook Ilbo reported that Singapore recommended the St. Regis, which hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping during his 2015 summit with Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, because it can be easily secured. ___ WHY'S HE TAKING THE RISK? The short answer might be that, despite his safety worries, Kim could end up getting much more out of this summit than he will have to give up. The standard thinking goes that he needs quick help to stabilize and then rebuild an economy that has suffered amid a decades-long pursuit of nuclear bombs, and that the North Koreans see a unique chance to win concessions, legitimacy and protection from a meeting with a highly unconventional U.S. president who's willing to consider options past American leaders would not. Kim also gets an \"obvious and immediate win\" by simply meeting with Trump, writes Joseph Yun, who was the top U.S. diplomat on North Korea until March. It's \"a sign of recognition that the North Koreans have sought for decades. In my meetings with North Korea's foreign ministry, its officials have repeatedly emphasized that only a leader-to-leader dialogue could break the nuclear impasse. At the root of this desire lies their central concern: regime survival,\" he wrote. The summit has been portrayed as a \"get to know you\" meeting. \"That's a perfect deal for North Korea. They pocket all of it and lose essentially nothing,\" said Christopher Hill, President George W. Bush's lead nuclear negotiator with the North. \"The North Koreans have already gotten what they need out of this. Their only issue is how much they have to give up. From what I can tell from (Trump's recent comments at the White House), they're not going to be asked to do much.\" Kim may also be seeing the gamble in a light never considered by his autocratic father and grandfather because of \"his determination to modernize North Korea,\" according to Ryan Haas, an Asia expert at the John L. Thornton China Center. \"Kim confronts rising expectations from within at the same time that he contends with ever-tightening sanctions from abroad,\" Haas wrote. \"So, according to this logic, in order to satisfy internal expectations, he will need to reduce external pressure, and this dynamic could push Kim down the path of denuclearization.\" Haas offers a useful warning, though, as people around the world settle in to watch the show in Singapore: \"Virtually no North Korea analyst inside or outside of the U.S. government\" expects Kim to actually give up his nukes. ___ Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ Foster Klug is AP's bureau chief in South Korea and has covered the Koreas since 2005.

Trump arrived at the Istana, Singapore's government house, shortly before noon. He and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) are meeting one on one before they're joined by aides for a larger working lunch. In October, Trump praised the U.S. relationship with Singapore and called Loong a \"wonderful and loyal partner.\" Waiters were spotted near an elaborate dining room carrying Diet Cokes. That's Trump's beverage of choice. __ 11:55 a.m. President Donald Trump has arrived at Singapore's government house for a meeting with the island city-state's leader. Trump and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) are meeting Monday at the Istana house. The two leaders are scheduled to meet one on one before an expanded working lunch with aides. The streets were lined with press and onlookers with cell phones as Trump's motorcade made its way from his hotel. Singapore is hosting Tuesday's unprecedented summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over dismantling the North's nuclear weapons program. Trump and Kim arrived in Singapore hours apart on Sunday night. Kim and Lee also met on Sunday. Trump will also meet with U.S. Embassy personnel later Monday. ___ 10:55 a.m. South Korea has started surveying South Koreans who would be willing to meet their war-separated relatives in North Korea for temporary reunions planned between the rivals as a reconciliatory measure. Seoul's Unification Ministry said Monday the surveys conducted through home visits, phone calls and letters will continue through Aug. 10. South Korea has lobbied hard for Tuesday's summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the future of Kim's nuclear program. Seoul says improved inter-Korean relations are important because North Korea wouldn't be willing to give up its nuclear weapons unless it feels its security has been assured. Kim's meeting with Trump comes after Kim's recent meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in (jah-YIHN'). The Koreas plan to hold military talks Thursday to reduce tension across their heavily armed border. ___ 9:20 a.m. President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un will start their historic summit with a one-on-one session with translators. A U.S. official says Monday that the leaders will meet for up to two hours before an expanded bilateral meeting with their respective advisers. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about internal deliberations and insisted on anonymity. Officials remain uncertain what will come out of Tuesday's unprecedented summit, the first of its kind between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea. Trump has said he wants to strike a deal to get the North to give up its nuclear weapons. He also has sought to lower expectations for the meeting, saying it may be the start of a longer process. ___ 6:50 a.m. North Korea's official media have reported that leader Kim Jong Un is in Singapore to meet President Donald Trump to discuss how to forge a new relationship. The first word Kim is in Singapore for Tuesday's summit came early Monday morning. Though North Koreans have been left largely in the dark about the summit, the reports of his arrival came relatively quickly by North Korean standards. A dispatch by the state-run Korean Central News Agency says Kim and Trump will exchange \"wide-ranging and profound views\" on establishing a new relationship, the issue of building a \"permanent and durable peace mechanism\" and realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The report notes the summit is being held \"under the great attention and expectation of the whole world.\" ___ 11:35 p.m. U.S. and North Korean officials are set to meet in Singapore to make final preparations for the summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, who has taken the lead on policy negotiations with the North, will hold a working group with a North Korean delegation at 10 a.m. Monday local time, or 10 p.m. Sunday on the U.S. East Coast. Sanders says Trump spent his flight from Canada to Singapore \"meeting with his staff, reading materials and preparing for his meetings in Singapore.\" Trump and Kim are set to meet at 9 a.m. Tuesday in Singapore, which is 9 p.m. Monday on the U.S. East Coast. ___ 10:30 p.m. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says the North Korean leader has already achieved some success just by bringing the American president to the table. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey says: \"To the extent that Kim Jong Un has already gone from international pariah to being normalized internationally, you have to say that he's had some success here.\" Menendez also stresses that getting a nuclear deal with North Korea will not be the hard point, noting that several previous presidents were able to strike deals only to see them fall apart. The test will be whether a deal has \"verifiable elements of a denuclearization,\" to prove whether the North has dismantled its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Menendez spoke Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" as President Donald Trump arrived in Singapore ahead of Tuesday's talks with Kim. ___ 8:25 p.m. President Donald Trump has arrived in Singapore where he will meet with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. Trump landed at 8:21 Sunday evening at the island city-state's Paya Lebar Air Base, traveling from Canada, where he attended a meeting of the Group of Seven Nations. Trump's high-risk meeting with Kim is scheduled for 9 a.m. Tuesday, or 9 p.m. June 11 on the U.S. East Coast. The president hopes to win a legacy-making deal with the North to give up their nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting. This will be the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting U.S. president. The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. ___ 7:10 p.m. Pope Francis has prayed that the summit this week between the U.S. and North Korean leaders succeeds in laying the groundwork for peace. Francis expressed hope Sunday that Tuesday's talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore will \"contribute to the development of a positive path that will assure a future of peace for the Korean Peninsula and the entire world.\" He invited the thousands of faithful in St. Peter's Square to pray with him so that the Virgin Mary \"accompany these talks.\" Francis said he wanted yet again to send \"a special thought in friendship and prayer\" to the beloved Korean people. ___ 6:50 p.m. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ahead of Tuesday's summit with President Donald Trump. Kim smiled broadly in the meeting Sunday evening. Kim told Lee: \"The entire world is watching the historic summit between the DPRK and the United States of America, and thanks to your sincere efforts ... we were able to complete the preparation for the historic summit.\" ___ 3:15 p.m. A plane presumably carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Singapore ahead of Kim's summit Tuesday with President Donald Trump. The jet landed at the airport Sunday afternoon amid huge security precautions on the city-state island. Kim is set to meet Tuesday with Trump in what's shaping up to be one of the most unusual summits in modern history. Despite the initial high stakes of a meeting meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-each-other meeting. He has also raised the possibility of further summits."}{"head": "\nFrom hairstyles to handshakes: what went down at the Trump-Kim summit ", "classes": [], "content": "\nIllustration: Sreejith R Kumar\n\u00a0\n The media was in a frenzy before, during, and after, the TrumpKim summit. It started when Trump flew off in a huff (which is what keeps that hairstyle in place) from the G-7minus1 group selfie in Canada, and landed early in Singapore. Since it is sacrosanct to arrive on time in Singapore, he was immediately fined. It was a watershed moment.Kim said his plane came first. His limo came to the Capella hotel first (seven minutes earlier!). The sun even rises first in North Korea.Trump travelled with a hundred-odd limos and planes. Kim travelled with his own loo (beat that, America!) which he took back to Pyongyang. The summit will now be called KimTrumps.The diplomats were in a frenzy. The peace talks followed days of dithering and blathering, with Trump calling Kim belligerent (which translated into Korean as belly-lint) and Kim calling Trump old, and Trump calling Kim short and fat, and Trump calling Trudeau fake-faced, for good measure. After this, they issued joint statements that their countries cared not for body images (Miss America scrapped the swimsuit round at once to prove it); they cared instead for haircuts.The barbers were in a frenzy. The salons in Singapore had queues lined up outside them, with demands for the Kim katora-cut or the Trump buffoon (bouffant, we\u2019ve been corrected).Singaporeans were in a frenzy. They were lining up the Pie (freeway, not free pie) to take selfies. With black cars. With Kim\u2019s running bodyguards. With Trump\u2019s retinue of Dwayne Johnsons. No one seemed to know why \u2014 there was a queue and so they were morally obliged to join it.South Korea was in a frenzy. After the summit, Trump said he would stop playing games in the sea with them. What\u2019s more, Trump called Kim talented and said they had a special bond which was\u2026 (who cares about the in-between text?)\u2026 big and dangerous for the world.The translators were in a frenzy. How does one convey the criticality of not overdoing daegu jorem, dauphinois, oiseon or trop\u00e9zienne? (And that was only the lunch menu).The analysts were in a frenzy. There were seven handshakes (lucky!). The first handshake lasted 13 seconds (unlucky!). Trump held Kim\u2019s arm (his arm!) above the elbow \u2014 surely that meant more than below the knuckle? Trump held out his hand first. Kim smiled first. Trump wore a red tie. Kim wore elevated heels. Trump was still 20 cm taller than Kim. North Korean bodyguards checked the pen with which Kim signed the summit (no trust, no trust! Bad omen!).But what of the actual talks? The two leaders spent a long time comparing buttons. Trump went on record saying his was bigger than Kim\u2019s. At 13.41 (nine is a lucky number!), they signed an agreement with four bullets (bullets?! \u2014 bad news!) Kim promised to disarm. Trump promised him a Big Mac.As the frenzy died down, there was only one thing that mattered and Lennon said it first: \u2018Give peace a chance.\u2019\u00a0Where Jane De Suza, the author of Happily Never After, talks about the week\u2019s quirks, quacks and hacksSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 20, 2018 12:41:46 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-closer-look-at-the-trump-kim-summit-in-singapore/article24171431.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nKim-Trump to discuss denuclearisation at Singapore summit\n", "classes": [], "content": "North Korean state media announced on Monday that its leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss issues such as denuclearisation during their summit on Tuesday here, as part of a new era in relations between the two countries.According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the two leaders will talk in Singapore about \u201cestablishing new North Korea-U.S. relations, building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern, as required by this new era\u201d, reports Efe news.

Restaurants are marking the city-state\u2019s time in the global spotlight with everything from red, white and blue cocktails to tacos named after the two leaders. Several of the stunts are being marketed with a twist on Trump\u2019s signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. At Harmony Nasi Lemak in central Singapore a signboard with drawings of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim greets passers-by with the words- \u201cLet\u2019s make HARMONY great again!\u201d Inside it\u2019s selling what it calls the \u201cTrump-Kim Chi Nasi Lemak,\u201d which puts American and Korean elements in a traditional dish of rice, fish or chicken and chili paste that is popular in Singapore and neighboring Malaysia. The new dish features U.S. dry-aged beef and a stack of spicy kimchi, a Korean staple. Zach Wen, the restaurant\u2019s co-founder, said the dish isn\u2019t just a gimmick and he hopes it spreads a positive message. He noted that it\u2019s already been well received. \u201cSome Korean people who came ... love the kimchi a lot and others [are] saying that the portion is so huge. Why so big? I say because it\u2019s the American version, it\u2019s the American portion,\u201d he said. At the Mexican restaurant Lucha Loco, they\u2019re promising to \u201cmake tacos great again\u201d by selling specialty tacos by the name of \u201cEl Gringo,\u201d which in Spanish means the foreigner, and \u201cEl Hombre Cohete,\u201d which translates as the rocket man. The former has the flavors of an American cheeseburger, while the latter is packed with Korean fried chicken. Executive chef Nelson Burgos said the restaurant is also offering customers the chance to smash pi\u0169atas shaped as caricatures of the two leaders that are filled with sweets. It\u2019s \u201ca gesture of celebration for us and for having such a big event in Singapore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an event that\u2019s probably never going to happen again in our lifetimes.\u201d Meanwhile, at the nightspot Escobar, they\u2019re offering specialty summit cocktails. The \u201cTrump\u201d is a layered bourbon-based drink in the colors of the American flag. The \u201cKim\u201d is deep red and shaken with soju, a vodka-like alcohol loved in both Koreas. Owner Stan Sri Ganesh was pleased that so many establishments were coming up with commemorative food and drinks. \u201cI think it reflects well on Singapore that we\u2019re not all that quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be very colorful if we want to.

Mr. Trump flew into Singapore\u2019s Paya Lebar Air Base aboard Air Force One looking to strike a deal that will lead to the denuclearisation of one of America\u2019s bitterest foes.After stepping down from Air Force One on a steamy tropical night, Mr. Trump was greeted by Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.Asked by a reporter how he felt about the summit, Mr. Trump said: \u201cVery good\u201d.

Discussions have been very positive, and significant progress has been made,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. Last week, Mr. Trump met with a top North Korean official at the White House to plan for the summit. The official handed him a letter from Kim Jong-un.\u201cI am not going to get into the specifics of the letter, but as the president said, they were interesting, and we feel like things are continuing to move forward, and good progress has been made, and we\u2019re continuing to prepare for the president\u2019s summit,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. When asked whether Mr. Trump supports a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, she said the focus of the administration right now was the President\u2019s meeting with the North Korean leader. \u201cAnd the President will make his views known directly to him when we\u2019re in Singapore, and our focus will continue to be on denuclearisation,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. Responding to a question on \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy on North Korea, the press secretary said the US policy towards Pyongyang has not changed. \u201cOur policy hasn\u2019t changed. And as the president stated, we have sanctions on. They\u2019re very powerful, and we would not take those sanctions off unless North Korea denuclearises,\u201d she said.

The two leaders arrived in the tropical city-state on Sunday. Key gaps remain over what denuclearisation would entail for two countries that have been enemies since the 1950-1953 Korean War, and the officials were trying to push the agenda forward before their leaders meet on Tuesday.Commenting for the first time on the agenda, North Korea\u2019s state-run KCNA news agency said the two sides would exchange \u201cwide-ranging and profound views\u201d to re-set relations. It heralded the summit as part of a \u201cchanged era\u201d. Discussions would focus on \u201cthe issue of building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, the issue of realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern,\u201d KCNA said.In the lead up to the summit, North Korea rejected any unilateral nuclear disarmament, and KCNA\u2019s reference to denuclearisation of the peninsula has historically meant that Pyongyang wants the United States to remove its \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d protecting South Korea and Japan. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is also in Singapore, said in a tweet that Washington was \u201ccommitted to the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\u201d.A Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US side was entering the talks with a sense of optimism and an equal dose of scepticism given North Korea\u2019s long history of developing nuclear weapons. \u201cWe will not be surprised by any scenario,\u201d said the official.With the eyes of the world following him, Trump flew into Singapore\u2019s Paya Lebar Air Base aboard Air Force One on Sunday, fresh from a divisive G7 meeting in Canada with some of Washington\u2019s closest allies that further strained global trade ties. Asked by a reporter how he felt about the summit, Trump said: \u201cVery good\u201d. In a tweet on Monday, he said: \u201cGreat to be in Singapore, excitement in the air!\u201dKim had arrived hours earlier on a plane loaned by China, which for decades has been North Korea\u2019s only major ally. Both leaders were greeted on arrival by Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. When Trump and Kim meet at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Tuesday they will be making history as leaders of their two countries have never met previously \u2013 or even spoken on the telephone. The summit\u2019s venue is the Capella hotel on Sentosa, a resort island off Singapore\u2019s port with a Universal Studios theme park and man-made beaches.Trump is to meet Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday while Kim has no official agenda. Kim arrived at Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport after his longest trip overseas as head of state, wearing his trademark dark \u201cMao suit\u201d and distinctive high-cut hairstyle. He has not left his country since taking office in 2011 other than to visit China and the South Korean side of the border Demilitarised Zone. Travelling with him were top officials including Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, Defence Minister No Kwang Chol and Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of Kim who has been instrumental in the diplomacy that culminated in Tuesday\u2019s summit.Kim Yo Jong, leader Kim\u2019s younger sister, was also spotted in his delegation. She emerged as an influential figure in Pyongyang\u2019s opaque leadership in February, when she led a North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Officials who arrived with Trump include Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.Bolton\u2019s hardline rhetoric last month infuriated North Korea and nearly derailed the summit. He called for North Korea to follow a \u201cLibya model\u201d in negotiations. Libya unilaterally surrendered its nuclear weapons programme in 2003, but its leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was killed in 2011 by NATO-backed rebels.Trump, speaking in Canada on Saturday, said any agreement at the summit would be \u201cspur of the moment,\u201d underscoring the uncertain outcome of what he called a \u201cmission of peace\u201d. He initially touted the potential for a grand bargain with North Korea to rid itself of a nuclear missile programme that has advanced rapidly to threaten the United States. But he has since lowered expectations, backing away from an original demand for North Korea\u2019s swift denuclearisation. He has said the talks would be more about starting a relationship with Kim for a negotiating process that would take more than one summit.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said US and North Korean officials would hold working-level talks on Monday. She said the US delegation would be led by Sung Kim, a veteran diplomat who recently held talks with North Korean officials. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday\u2019s meeting appeared aimed at making 11th-hour progress ahead of the summit since Sung Kim\u2019s earlier talks did little to narrow a gap between the two sides on the definition of denuclearisation or win agreement on tangible commitments from Pyongyang toward dismantling its nuclear arsenal."}{"head": "Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un Singapore summit: Here\u2019s what they\u00a0said", "classes": [], "content": "Express Audio: Veteran journalist Coomi Kapoor on media freedom and how it has changed over the yearsWith the world watching, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday shook hands and smiled for the cameras ahead of their historic summit in Singapore\u2019s Sentosa Island.

At their much anticipated summit meeting here Tuesday, Trump and Kim Jong-un have begun an unprecedented effort to dismantle a seven-decade-old conflict in the Korean Peninsula. Working together with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump and Kim are getting ready to turn Asian geopolitics inside out.READ |\u00a0Reading the Singapore Summit statement: Three principles and one political\u00a0gestureThe story of the summit between Trump and Kim began as a narrow narrative on de-nuking North Korea.

In hinting at potential American military retrenchment, Trump might compel the region to seek a new balance of power.But first to the three principles outlined in the deceptively bald statement issued after the meeting between Trump and Kim. For the nuclear nerds and the media focused on \u2018complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament\u2019 \u2014 CVID for short \u2014 it is a rude shock to find it missing in the joint statement.READ |\u00a0Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un Singapore summit: Here\u2019s what they\u00a0saidTo be sure, there is a reference to \u2018complete denuclearisation\u2019 in the third principle and Kim\u2019s \u2018firm and unwavering commitment\u2019 to it. But it is embedded in a larger political construct about changing the nature of the political relationship between America and North Korea. If American conventional strategic wisdom put the technical above the political, Trump has reversed the equation.The first principle in the joint statement talks about commitment of Trump and Kim to establish a new relationship between the two nations. The second principle connects nuclear disarmament to the de-escalation of the larger security dynamic in the Peninsula. It calls for a joint effort to build a \u2018lasting and stable peace regime\u2019.READ |\u00a0Trump-Kim summit: What the Singapore handshake means for IndiaThis is probably the most weighty element of the framework unveiled by Trump and Kim. This is where the question of American security guarantees to North Korea come. Trump\u2019s comments at the lengthy press conference after the talks go a long way in assuring Kim that Washington is not contemplating regime change in North Korea.Trump refused to rise to the bait when the Western journalists repeatedly pushed him on the question of human rights in North Korea. He showered praise on Kim as a \u2018talented leader\u2019. He did not flinch from his emphasis on building friendship with Kim. He went lyrical on the shared destiny of North and South Korea and the benefits of national reconciliation in the Peninsula.Even more important, Trump announced that he is suspending the routine US military exercises in South Korea that the North has always seen as provocative. The peace regime could also involve many measures to de-escalate the military tensions between North and South Korea.READ |\u00a0North Korea state media plasters front pages with Kim Jong Un\u2019s Singapore\u00a0tripTrump\u2019s musings on bringing home the 32,000 US troops in South Korea at some point in future has sent shock waves through the American establishment. While the President insisted that the withdrawal is not on the cards for now, he has revealed an important element of his world view.During his campaign for Presidency in 2016 \u2014 before that as well as since \u2014 Trump has consistently raised questions about the costs and benefits of US military presence in Asia. He has insisted that America\u2019s allies must do more. In suggesting that the region must fend for itself, Trump has opened up space for rearranging the international relations of East Asia.Trump is not the only revisionist in Asia. Kim\u2019s emphasis on economic modernisation has turned the nuclear arsenal into a negotiating instrument rather than an end in itself. Moon, without whom Trump and Kim could not have got to Singapore, has defied the conventional wisdom in betting that reconciliation with the North is possible.As the trio disrupts the regional order, two nations will put on their thinking hat. Both Tokyo and Beijing are deeply wary of Korean nationalism and the potential unity between North and South. Japan\u2019s premier Shinzo Abe will have no choice but to evaluate Japan\u2019s national security options if he sees that Trump is bent on scaling down American commitment to Asian alliances.China, which should have been happy at American retrenchment, has reasons of its own to worry. For the strategic vacuum resulting from such retrenchment will create many new instabilities, encourage its Asian neighbours to strengthen their national military postures, including the consideration of nuclear weapons.But nowhere is the shock more apparent than in Washington where Trump\u2019s Korean framework is generating a political backlash. His ability to mollify the domestic reaction would depend on how quickly he can move, along with Kim and Moon, in translating the Singapore framework into concrete outcomes.

Restaurants are marking the city-state\u2019s time in the global spotlight with everything from red, white and blue cocktails to tacos named after the two leaders.

The US-North Korea summit held in Singapore\u2019s Sentosa Island resulted in the signing of a \u201ccomprehensive document\u201d pledging, among other things, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.As the two leaders came together to make the historic negotiation, the entire world watched with much anticipation. The two countries have been at loggerheads with each other since the 1950s, when cold war politics resulted in the Korean peninsula being divided between the North and the South. While on one hand, South Korea got into a powerful alliance with America, the North, under Communist influence, became a strong ally of the USSR. In the ensuing years, while the Soviet Union disintegrated, North Korea\u2019s relations with America was primarily marked by an aggressive nuclear weapons programme.Through these years of conflict between the two countries, India has had a rather curious relationship with North Korea. After the Second World War, when the world split into two with supporters on either the side of America or that of the Soviet Union, India declared its stance of non-alignment. Consequently, it never interfered in the military operations of either of the countries, but it did provide humanitarian aid to North Korea during the war. Over the years though, geopolitics has ensured that neither has it offered its fullest support to the country on account of the relations necessitated with South Korea and America, nor has India completely alienated itself from the region as a consequence of the troubled relations that the latter shares with the neighbouring regions of Pakistan and China. The summit on Tuesday, however, might change much in the space of diplomatic ties between the two countries.The first time that India and North Korea developed consular relations was in 1962 and in 1973, full diplomatic ties were established between the two countries. \u201cRelations between India and North Korea have been historically positive, marred only by North Korea-Pakistan ties related to missile and nuclear technology. This is principally a reflection of India\u2019s position of strategic autonomy which will not allow another country (read: the US) to determine the shape and form of India\u2019s bilateral relations (at least in theory),\u201d foreign policy expert and Fellow at Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Abhijnan Rej told Indianexpress.com.India\u2019s commitment to go ahead with diplomatic relations with North Korea is evident from the fact that the former continued to have an embassy at Pyongyang, despite significant pressure from the USA to not do so. \u201cOne should also remember that India was for DPRK, till recently, its third largest trading partner,\u201d says Rej. As per government data, in the year 2015-16, Indian exports from North Korea amounted to $111 million, while imports amounted to $88 million.Further, the Center for Space Science and Technology in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP) located in Dehradun is reported to have been one of the first institutes in the world to have provided technical training to North Korean students, even after the United Nations declared its first set of nuclear sanctions against the country in 2006. In fact, it has been an embarrassment for India that courses offered in the institute directly trained several North Korean applicants in nuclear strategy.The famine that crippled the North Korean economy in the mid 1990s, continued to plague the nation for a long time, with food shortages being repeatedly reported from there. A lesser known fact, however, is the amount of aid provided by the Manmohan Singh-led government to the peninsula at a time when the country was isolated from practically every other corner. In 2010, reportedly, 900 tonnes of soya beans and 373 tonnes of wheat was sent across to North Korea from India to help revive its food economy.It was only in 2017 that India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs, reacting strongly to North Korea\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile launch, declared a ban on all trade with the region, with the exception of shipments of food and medicine. The declaration brought to an end the long-held trade links between the two countries. The decision to ban trade links with North Korea came at a time when India was increasing its trade links with South Korea.Most importantly though, North Korea\u2019s consistently growing nuclear aggression was a cause of worry to India in the face of a possible collaboration between Pyongyang and Pakistan. Reportedly, since the 1990s nuclear technology was indirectly transferred between Pakistan and North Korea, and the increased show of nuclear strength on the part of the latter raises concerns for India.Less than a month before the summit at Singapore was scheduled to be held, India\u2019s Minister of State for External Affairs, V K Singh visited Pyongyang. This was the first high-level visit from India to North Korea in over 20 years. In the coming weeks, New Delhi would be preparing for the visit of South Korean president Moon Jae-in. The meeting between America and North Korea, is being closely watched by New Delhi for the impact it might have on future relations and involvement with North Korea.While the possibility of a collaboration with Pakistan is foremost on the list of concerns for India when it comes to North Korea\u2019s anticipated denuclearisation drive, a new relationship between Washington and Pyongyang could also benefit India in ensuring a new market in the East Asia. This is significant to the country in the wake of the Modi government\u2019s \u2018Act East policy\u2019 that focuses on increasing economic ties between India and its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.However, experts are still unsure of the precise outcome of the summit, making it difficult to foresee an impact it might have on the Indian policy. \u201cIt is entirely unclear, going beyond the hoopla, what this summit has achieved beyond a DPRK assurance to commit to \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d of the Korean peninsula. It is unclear whether the North Korean understanding of \u2018denuclearisation\u2019 and that of the US\u2019s match, so Kim\u2019s commitment lacks specificity. In principle, a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons contributes to regional stability \u2014 and as such will be welcomed by most countries, India included. It is, however, unclear at this stage exactly how far all parties are from that goal,\u201d says Rej.\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/adrija-roy.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />Adrija RoychowdhuryAdrija is\u00a0senior sub-editor, Indian Express.

Trump is set to meet with Lee tomorrow.Trump has said he hopes to win a legacy-making deal with the North to give up their nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting.The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep scepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the North.This will be the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting US president.The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.The North Korean autocrat's every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists who have converged on Singapore, and by gawkers around the world, up until he shakes hands with Trump on Tuesday.It's a reflection of the intense global curiosity over Kim's sudden turn to diplomacy in recent months after a slew of North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year raised serious fears of war. Part of the interest in Tuesday's summit is simply because Kim has had such limited appearances on the world stage. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his father's death in late 2011 \u2014 twice travelling to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea respectively. But it is Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons that gives his meeting with Trump such high stakes.The meeting was initially meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-you session.Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.It's unclear what Trump and Kim might decide Tuesday.Pyongyang has said it is willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with a reliable security assurance and other benefits. But many say this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to holding onto his unchecked power. Any nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea's willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country's warheads and nuclear fuel, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea's reluctance to open its doors to outsiders.Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea. The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, but the war technically continues today because instead of a difficult-to-negotiate peace treaty, military officers for the US-led United Nations, North Korea and China signed an armistice that halted the fighting.The North may see a treaty \u2014 and its presumed safety assurances from Washington \u2014 as its best way of preserving the Kim family dynasty. The ensuing recognition as a \"normal country\" could then allow sanctions relief, and later international aid and investment.Just meeting with Trump will also give Kim a recognition North Korea has long sought, setting him up as global player and equal to the US domestically and, internationally, as the leader of a \"normal country\" worthy of respect."}{"head": "\nAhead of Trump-Kim summit, Singapore city on North Korean border has strongest sales\n", "classes": [], "content": "Dandong: Even as the island nation of Singapore rushes to get ready for the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, one of its namesakes is basking in the publicity too - on China's border with North Korea.The Singapore City condominium in Dandong, the main gateway into North Korea in northeastern China, is celebrating its strongest sales in six years thanks to property speculators who see the June 12 meeting as another sign that the reclusive state will soon be open for business.\u00a0With a riverside view that looks directly over North Korea, the 2,400-unit project by Singaporean developer Brothers (Holdings) Ltd broke ground in 2008 but saw annual sales of less than a hundred units in the last five years as China's neighbour grew more focused on its nuclear programme.That changed in one stroke at end of April when North Korea's Kim announced that the isolated country would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and pursue economic growth and peace, said T.C. Koh, group managing director of the company.Singapore City then sold 587 units in May, more than quadruple the number in April, making it the top-selling development in the area, he said. That drove the price from an average of about 4,000 yuan ($625) per square metre in 2015 to close to 6,000 yuan per square metre.\"Suddenly everybody came in. From that time onwards we started selling 30-40 units a day,\" he told Reuters in an interview at the project's showroom, decorated with water-spouting statues of Singapore's unofficial mascot, the mythical Merlion.Trump sent the city-state spinning when he announced that the summit would be held there last month, only to cancel it a week later. On June 1, he said the summit was back on, prompting urgent preparations and a wave of promotions from businesses looking to cash in.Koh said he did not think the Singapore's host status was driving buyers to its namesake project, saying it was ultimately the development's location in Dandong where the broader property market has heated up.Still, he said he was contemplating launching activities to commemorate the event at the showroom, though he was a little cautious, citing the uncertain nature of the meeting and the countries' leaders.\"It's still a wait and see, because you don't know if it'll be a success or failure,\" he said. \"If it's a failure then we'll have a problem. All the investors will run away!\""}{"head": "\nRestaurants in Singapore get ready for the Trump-Kim summit\n", "classes": [], "content": ""}{"head": "\nKim Jong Un arrives in Singapore for historic summit with Trump\n", "classes": [], "content": "Singapore: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on June 10 for an unprecedented summit with Donald Trump, an attempt to address the last festering legacy of the Cold War, with the US president calling it a \"one time shot\" at peace.Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal -- which has seen it subjected to several sets of UN Security Council sanctions and threatened with military action by the Trump administration -- will top the agenda.\u00a0Bringing the Korean War to a formal end 65 years after hostilities ceased will also be on the table at the first-ever summit between a North Korean leader and a sitting president of its \"imperialist enemy\".Kim arrived in Singapore on board an Air China 747 that according to flight tracking website Flightradar24 took off from Pyongyang in the morning ostensibly bound for Beijing, then changed its flight number midair and headed south.The city-state's foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan tweeted a picture of himself shaking hands with Kim at Changi Airport, and the North Korean leader was driven into the centre in a stretch Mercedes-Benz limousine, accompanied by a convoy of more than 20 vehicles.Kim was due to meet Singaporean President Lee Hsien Loong later on Sunday, the city-state's foreign ministry said, while Trump was flying from Canada on board Air Force One after leaving the G7 summit early.Authorities imposed tight security around the summit venue and related luxury hotels -- including installing extra pot plants outside Kim's expected accommodation to obstruct reporters' views.Tuesday's Singapore meeting is the climax of the astonishing flurry of diplomacy on and around the Korean peninsula this year, but critics charge that it risks being largely a triumph of style over substance.Washington is demanding the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation (CVID) of the North, while Pyongyang has so far only made public pledges of its commitment to the denuclearisation of the peninsula -- a term open to wide interpretation -- while seeking security guarantees.Former US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage expected little progress on the key issue of defining denuclearisation. \"The success will be in the shutter clicks of the cameras,\" he said. \"They both get what they want.\"Trump insisted last week that the summit would \"not be just a photo op\", saying it would help forge a \"good relationship\" that would lead to a \"process\" towards the \"ultimate making of a deal\".But as he embarked for Singapore he changed his tune, calling it a \"one-time shot\" and adding he will know \"within the first minute\" whether an agreement will be possible.\"If I think it won't happen, I'm not going to waste my time,\" he said. He has also dangled the prospect of Kim Jong Un visiting Washington if the meeting goes well.But even the merit of the event itself -- long sought by the North, and which Trump apparently impulsively agreed to in March, reportedly without consulting his advisers -- has been called into question.\"People call it a historic summit but... it is important to understand that this summit was available to any US president who wanted to do it and the point is no US president wanted to do this, and for good reasons,\" said Christopher Hill, a former lead US nuclear negotiator with North Korea.The two countries have been at loggerheads for decades. The North invaded the South in 1950 and the ensuing war saw US-led UN troops backing Seoul fight their way to a stalemate against Pyongyang's forces which were aided by Russia and China, before the conflict ended in stalemate and an armistice which sealed the division of the peninsula.Sporadic provocations by the North have continued while Pyongyang has made increasing advances in its nuclear arsenal, which it says it needs to defend against the risk of a US invasion.Last year it carried out by far its most powerful nuclear test to date and launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, sending tensions soaring to a level unseen in years as a newly-elected Trump traded threats of war and colourful personal insults with Kim, with Trump dubbed a \"dotard\" and Kim \"Little Rocket Man\".But the South's Winter Olympics in February catalysed a flurry of diplomatic moves as Seoul's dovish leader Moon Jae-in sought to bring the two sides together. Kim has met twice with both Moon and Xi Jinping, the president of China,\u00a0the North's most important ally.Pyongyang has taken some steps to show sincerity, returning US detainees and blowing up its nuclear test site.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that progress was being made in bringing the two sides together in their understanding of denuclearisation. But Trump -- for whom a major accomplishment would bolster his position ahead of midterm elections in November -- baffled observers when he said he did not think he had to prepare \"very much\" for the summit.\"It's about attitude,\" Trump said. \"So this isn't a question of preparation.\"\u00a0"}{"head": "\n2 Indian-origin ministers in Singapore play key role in facilitating Trump-Kim summit\n", "classes": [], "content": "Singapore: Two Indian-origin ministers in Singapore, Vivian Balakrishnan and K Shanmugam, are playing a key role in facilitating a hassle-free summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un on Tuesday.Balakrishnan, Singapore's Foreign Minister, made important visits to Washington, Pyongyang and Beijing in recent days to ensure that there would be no last-minute spoilers for the historic meeting hosted by the city-state.\u00a0Balakrishnan, 57, is from the ruling People's Action Party.

Lee complimented the bold and admirable decision by Kim and Trump to come together for the Summit.Prime Minister Lee wished Kim a success for the summit and expressed hope that the US-North Korea meeting will advance the prospects for peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the larger region.Singapore is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea.Trump and Kim are set to meet on Tuesday, June 12 at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa for talks which could see North Korea dismantle its nuclear arsenal in return for economic help and security guarantees.The summit will be the first meeting between Trump and Kim and mark a turnaround of relations between the two leaders after a long-running exchange of furious threats and insults. The two leaders have had an extraordinary up-and-down relationship over the past 18 months.Some 2,500 journalists are reporting on the event, which is costing Singapore government about SGD 20 million."}{"head": "\nTight security around Singapore hotels on eve of Trump-Kim summit\n", "classes": [], "content": ""}{"head": "The Straits Times", "classes": [], "content": "TAKE THE QUIZWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

The two leaders are expected to address the complete denuclearisation of the peninsula and possibly declare an end to the nearly seven-decade-long Korean War.North Korea's state media said on Monday (June 11) that the two leaders will discuss a \"permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism\" on the Korean peninsula, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern.More than 2,500 international media personnel have descended upon Singapore, with images and footage of first Mr Kim's arrival, and then Mr Trump's, beamed live across the world.\"From our point of view, it's important that the meeting takes place, and that the meeting sets developments on a new trajectory - one that will be conducive to the security and stability of the region,\" Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after a visit to the media centre at the F1 Pit Building.Mr Lee also met Mr Kim at the Istana on Sunday evening, with Mr Kim - officially Chairman of the State Affairs Commission - expressing gratitude for Singapore's efforts to host the meeting. If the summit is successful, it would put Singapore in the history books, he added.The Trump-Kim Singapore summit will cost the hosts about $20 million, with about half going towards security costs.The protection accorded to both leaders was evident yesterday as traffic was stopped on roads as well as expressways to allow for uninterrupted passage of their convoys.The sight of two black limousines, with the respective flags of North Korea and the United States fluttering, amid a convoy of over 30 vehicles drew eager onlookers from the eastern part of the island to the central.Mr Trump is scheduled to meet Mr Lee on Monday (June 11)\u00a0before Tuesday's meeting with Mr Kim. US and North Korean officials will also hold last-minute talks in Singapore on Monday, White House spokesman Sarah Sanders said.Should the summit go well, it will be in stark contrast to the G-7 summit, where Mr Trump pulled the US out of a previously agreed communique after he had boarded the flight to Singapore, citing \"false statements\" by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In Singapore, the excitement was palpable. Hundreds whipped out camera phones to capture Mr Kim's entourage as it made its way from the St Regis Singapore, where he is staying, to the Istana.The Tanglin area, where both the St Regis and the Shangri-La Hotel, which will host Mr Trump, are located, was packed with onlookers.Among those who caught a glimpse of Mr Trump's motorcade was Mr Teo Hong Mong, 78, a retired aircraft engineer. He said: \"I wanted to see his big, fantastic limousine. This is very good publicity and exposure for Singapore.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

And like that declaration, the document signed in Singapore did not lay out a clear timeline for North Korea's denuclearisation.Still, speaking at a news conference at the Capella Singapore hotel on Sentosa island, Mr Trump said Mr Kim gave\u00a0his \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d\u00a0to work towards denuclearisation\u00a0 and they are prepared to \u201cwrite a new chapter\u201d between their countries.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Kim said: \"Today we had a very historic meeting, overcoming our past history and embarking on a new beginning...the world will see a major change.\"Mr Trump, in turn, said a turning point has\u00a0been reached in the long fraught US-North Korea relationship. \"We're both going to do something, and we've developed a very special bond...we're going to take care of a very big and dangerous problem for the rest of the world.\"It worked out far better for both of us than anybody could have expected,\" he added.The two leaders signed the document\u00a0at an 80-year-old, 4.3 m-long teak wood table\u00a0once used by Singapore\u2019s Chief Justices and\u00a0on loan from the National Gallery.They sat side by side at the table and were flanked on either side by American and North Korean flags.\u00a0The day had started with a historic handshake between the two leaders at the hotel.At 9.04am, Mr\u00a0Trump and Mr Kim\u00a0strode into\u00a0the courtyard from separate sides, stood face to face for the first time and\u00a0shared a 12-second\u00a0handshake against a backdrop of American and North Korean flags.The\u00a0moment - tightly choreographed, with both men walking out at exactly the same time - was the culmination of weeks of uncertainty, false starts and finally, frenetic preparations on the part of the US, North Korea and Singapore.From that point forward, the superlatives flowed. When asked how he felt as they\u00a0sat down for talks,\u00a0Mr Trump said: \"I feel really great.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a great discussion and, I think, tremendous success. It will be tremendously successful.\u00a0And it's my honour.\u00a0And we will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt.\"Mr Kim said: \"It was not easy to get here.\u00a0The past worked as fetters on our limbs, and the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles on our way forward.\u00a0But we overcame all of them, and we are here today\".A 41-minute one-on-one meeting ended with the two leaders smiling and waving to the media from a balcony and Mr Trump saying the discussion was \"very very good\".Then\u00a0at the extended bilateral meeting, Mr Kim said he believed the summit was a \"great prelude to peace\", to which Mr Trump agreed. \"Of course there will be difficulties along the way, but as of today, a day that a good start has been made, I am determined to start a grand undertaking together,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0After the signing ceremony, Mr Trump told the media:\u00a0\"We had a terrific day and we learnt a lot about each other and our countries.\"\u00a0Calling Mr Kim \"a very worthy, very smart negotiator\", Mr Trump said:\u00a0\"He's a very talented man, I also learnt that he loves his country very much.\" He added:\u00a0\"We'll meet again, we'll meet many times\"When asked if\u00a0 he would invite Mr Kim to the White House, Mr Trump said: \u201cAbsolutely, I will.\u201dIt was a remarkable turnaround from last year when the two leaders traded insults and threats as Pyongyang conducted a series of ballistic missile tests.Mr Kim acknowledged the historic moment on Tuesday morning when he was heard telling Mr Trump through a translator: \u201cI think the entire world is watching this moment. Many people in the world will think of this as a scene from a fantasy... science fiction movie.\u201dThe two sides also had a working lunch. Before they sat down,\u00a0Mr Trump told the media to get a good photo. \"Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.\u201dLunch was a nine-course meal with both Western and Asian flavours, according to the White House. The starters included mango kerabu \u2013 a Malay salad \u2013 and oiseon or Korean stuffed cucumbers and the main dishes were beef short rib confit\u00a0and sweet and sour crispy pork with Yangzhou fried rice. Dessert included\u00a0dark chocolate tartlet ganache and\u00a0Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis.\u00a0The US delegation included\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly\u00a0and National Security Adviser John Bolton. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, US Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim, and National Security Council senior director for Asia Matt Pottinger\u00a0joined the working lunch.The North Korean delegation\u00a0included\u00a0vice-chairman of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, Mr Kim Yong Chol, party vice-chairman and director of North Korea's International Affairs Department Ri Su Yong, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote on his Facebook page after the summit: \"It is a crucial first move in the long journey towards lasting peace and stability on a denuclearised Korean Peninsula, which would benefit our region and the rest of the world.\"I wrote to Mr Kim and Mr Trump to congratulate them on a successful summit. Singapore is honoured to have played host. We join the international community in celebrating this outcome, and wishing both the US and DPRK success in implementing this agreement,'' said Mr Lee, referring to North Korea by its formal name -\u00a0Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.South Korean President\u00a0Moon\u00a0Jae In also hailed the summit, calling it a\u00a0\"historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy\".\u00a0Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the talks were an important first step.\u00a0\u201cI support this as a first step to the comprehensive resolution of issues concerning North Korea.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0China\u00a0praised the\u00a0summit and urged\u00a0 \u00a0full denuclearisation by North Korea.\u00a0\u201cThe crux of the peninsula nuclear issue is a security issue. The most\u00a0 difficult part of this security issue is for the United States and North Korea to sit down to find a way to resolution through equal talks,\u201d said\u00a0Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\u00a0\"At the same time, there needs to be a peace mechanism for the Korean\u00a0peninsula\u00a0to resolve North Korea\u2019s reasonable security concerns,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u00a0There was an unprecedented level of security around the summit venue and the two luxury hotels where the two leaders stayed after they arrived in Singapore on Sunday (June 10).\u00a0Roads and expressways leading from St Regis Singapore and Shangri-La hotel\u00a0were\u00a0locked down on Tuesday\u00a0morning as the\u00a0 leaders made\u00a0their way to the Capella hotel on Sentosa, with many people gathered at different spots along the route, trying to catch a glimpse of the leaders.Property agent Joe Tham, 48, and his wife, who had waited outside Paya Lebar Air Base on Sunday for Mr Trump's arrival, brought chairs for the wait for Mr Kim in\u00a0Tanglin Road.\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment... it's very important to Singapore, and we want to be a part of it, to witness it,\" he said.Housewife Gladys Tan, 55, who lives near Shangri-La Hotel, said it was her second time waiting for Mr Trump, but she still could not see him through the tinted car window.\"I tried very, very hard but the glass is so black, I couldn't see anything. Or maybe my eyesight is just poor...\u00a0I couldn't wave at him so I waved at the policemen on motorbike. Consolation prize!\" she said.The perimetre of the Capella hotel was fortified with road blocks on one side. Coast guard vessels patrolled the waters off the resort's beach.Some curious onlookers turned up early on Sentosa to catch a glimpse of the convoys. Among them were students Gideon Tan, 16, Aryan Singh, 16, and Joshua Tan, 17.\u00a0Joshua, a keen reader of politics and history, said it\u00a0would be ideal if Mr Kim could commit to immediate denuclearisation and he\u00a0 hoped\u00a0that Mr Trump can provide the security assurance that North Korea wants.\u00a0About 5,000 Home Team officers were deployed for the summit.All in, Singapore spent about $20 million to host the historic meeting, which included picking up the North Korean contingent's hotel bill.Prime Minister Lee\u00a0said that the significance of the meeting meant it was a price that Singapore was willing to pay.\"If you calculate the price of everything in this world, you will miss out on the real important things. And, in this case, what is important is that the summit is held, and we are hosting it, not extravagantly but with due consideration to costs, but making sure operational requirements are met,\" he said.\u00a0Mr Trump and Mr Kim thanked Singapore for hosting the summit during separate bilateral meetings with PM Lee at the Istana.\u00a0The US president left Singapore after the press conference at Capella hotel on Tuesday.\u00a0He departed from Paya Lebar Airbase on Air Force One at 6.25pm, slightly earlier than his scheduled 7pm departure time.\u00a0We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

He said he was also confident about the Summit with North Korea.\"Added Ms Kartika Johnson, 45, who attended the event as a relative of a US embassy staff: \"He made us feel appreciated.\"Mr Trump landed at Paya Lebar Air Base just the night before, after attending the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Canada. He retracted his endorsement of the major economic powers' joint communique\u00a0while on his way to Singapore.Meanwhile, diplomats from the US and North Korea met behind closed doors at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore hotel, in a\u00a0bid to narrow their differences ahead of the summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim on Tuesday morning.Former US special representative for North Korea policy Sung Kim, who has been leading the US in talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui in the border truce village of Panmunjom since last month, is said to be continuing the discussions with his counterpart in Singapore.Top of\u00a0the agenda is Pyongyang's complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. Mr Kim is likely to ask for a security guarantee and the easing of sanctions in return, say analysts. A peace treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean War may also be on the table.Before sitting down for talks on Tuesday, Mr Trump intends to meet one on one with Mr Kim, the White House said.\u201cWe can expect a one-on-one at the beginning,\u201d NSC spokesman Robert Palladino told\u00a0reporters in Singapore on Monday.Media reports earlier quoted sources as saying the two men will meet briefly, with just their interpreters but no aides in the room.Mr Trump on Saturday said he believes he would know \"within the first minute\" of meeting Mr Kim if the North Korean leader is serious about surrendering his nuclear arsenal.Top aides will join them for the formal talks later, and they will most likely include Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton, as well as Mr Kim's sister, Ms Kim Yo Jong, and top aide and former spy chief Kim Yong Chol.The summit is the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, and comes after a year of tension on the Korean peninsula stoked by Mr Kim's numerous missile tests and a \"maximum pressure\" campaign led by the US to curb Pyongyang.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

It is understood that less than $5 million went to media costs, including the international media centre, for some 2,500 journalists. The Government did not elaborate on other expenses.But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's tour of the Marina Bay area made the front pages of many newspapers, and the Singapore skyline appeared on many news bulletins, including that of late-night talkshow host Trevor Noah.Media intelligence firm Meltwater estimates that the advertising value, based on global online media mentions over the three days the leaders were here, added up to $270 million. But take into consideration the buzz generated since last month, and advertising value balloons to about $767 million, it said.The number would likely have been higher if the expected value of print, broadcast or social media mentions was also tracked.While different firms use different formulas to calculate the estimated media value, Meltwater said it arrived at its estimates by multiplying the number of people it reached by 0.025, which is the probability that someone will read an article, and then by 37 cents, which is the industry formula for the monetary value of someone reading an article.The hotels, in particular, gained the most from the attention. About half of online articles, or over 20,000, mentioned the Capella, where the one-day summit between United States President Donald Trump and Mr Kim was held. The hotels where Mr Trump and Mr Kim stayed in - Shangri-La and The St Regis, respectively - had a mention in a fifth of the articles each.Media monitoring firm Isentia said it was also meaningful to analyse the sentiments of such coverage, estimating that 69 per cent of the buzz generated by the summit was positive, compared with 24 per cent which was neutral and 7 per cent that was negative.Besides the media exposure, Singapore can expect at least $7.2 million from the three days based on tourism receipts, said Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior lecturer Michael Chiam. He arrived at this figure from the roughly 4,000 journalists and security personnel spending an average of $600 a day, including their accommodation, which would have formed the bulk of the costs.However, this short-term gain might be counterbalanced by visitors who stayed away because of the summit, said Singapore Polytechnic retail and marketing lecturer Lucas Tok.In fact, increased security measures on Sentosa and in Orchard may have deterred some shoppers, local and tourist, he said.However, all analysts pointed towards benefits that would be reaped further down the road.\"Where is Singapore?\" became one of the most-asked questions on Google and indicated an increased awareness of the country, they said.Mr Tok said: \"Usually, after a place has received some traction, visitor numbers tend to go up in the next few months.\"Mr Nicholas Fang, director of security and global affairs at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said the summit boosted Singapore's branding in a global competitive environment.\"The fact that a small country like Singapore could be the focal point of global attention for so many days will do no harm to the Singapore brand, and there will be flow-down benefits to Singapore companies and individuals on the international stage,\" he said.\u2022 Additional reporting by Seow Bei YiCorrection note: An earlier version of the article described Kim Jong Un as South Korean leader.

Asked to elaborate, he replied: \"If you calculate the price of everything in this world, you will miss out on the real important things. And in this case what is important is that the summit is held, and we are hosting it, not extravagantly but with due consideration to costs, but making sure operational requirements are met.\"Besides the security bill, another substantial part of the costs is from facilitating the 2,500-strong contingent of journalists here. A Ministry of Communications and Information source said that this - including the set-up of the international media centre at the F1 Pit Building - comes in at around $5 million.The $20 million bill for the summit is a fraction of the $150 million spent each year to host past editions of the Formula One race.The issue of cost has, however, raised questions among some Singaporeans, who have also chafed at having to contend with restricted access and road closures.Asked about this, Mr Lee said that what is important to keep in mind is the significance of the summit and also what hosting it successfully could mean for Singapore.It is, he said, not just a whole-of-government effort, but a \"whole of Singapore effort\", involving people ranging from press officers to bomb disposal unit experts.It also includes ordinary Singaporeans whose lives have been \"a little bit inconvenienced because roads have been cordoned off and traffic jams can happen - I hope you will understand this is for a good cause, it is a national effort, and I hope we will all be able to work together to show the world what Singapore can do\".On Sunday, Mr Lee also visited Singapore Armed Forces troops deployed at Palawan Kidz City on Sentosa, and the Home Team command post in Novena. \"The officers have done a good job under very pressed circumstances,\" he said, pointing to the short notice given. It was only two weeks ago that it was confirmed the summit was going ahead.It is not easy to find a suitable location to host such a meeting, observed Mr Lee, as both the Americans and the North Koreans must agree on a venue that meets their requirements and is politically and diplomatically acceptable to them.\"Therefore, when the two sides asked us to host the meeting, we cannot say no,\" he said. \"We have to step up... We can do a good job.\"The summit is a plus for Singapore, in terms of its reputation, its standing and \"how people look at us\", he added. \"It gives us publicity. The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting - we did not ask for it, but we were asked and we agreed - says something about Singapore's relations with the parties, with America, with North Korea, also our standing in the international community.\"Singapore is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with both sides. Mr Lee added: \"I think people will sit up and say, why is this meeting happening in Singapore, and they will draw their conclusions, and they will see how things are run. And I'm sure that we will be able to show what Singapore can do, so I think it's a plus for Singapore.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

The resort island was recently gazetted as a \"special event\u00a0area\" by the Government.Meanwhile, it is believed that Mr Trump will stay at the Shangri-La Hotel off Orchard Road. Mr Kim is likely to reside at the St Regis Singapore.As June 12 draws near, here's a look at the trio of venues where summit activity is likely to be the busiest.The luxury hotel is set in a tranquil 15-acre site off Orchard Road, and has 747 hotel rooms spread over three wings, including 26 suites for heads of states and distinguished guests.The area surrounding the hotel had been declared a \"special event area\" for the period June 10 to 14.This means that security restrictions will be imposed in the area, and people and vehicles who enter the demarcated area will see stricter security measures and may be subjected to spot checks.Earlier, some observers had said that the gazetting of the area around Shangri-La Hotel raised the likelihood of the hotel being the venue of the summit.But with Capella Hotel being announced as the official summit venue by the White House, it is now likely instead that one of the two leaders will be staying at Shangri-La Hotel.The hotel's presidential suite, called the Valley Wing Shangri-La Suite, is where some experts think Mr Trump might stay during his visit. It has a private entrance and lift.It has also hosted former US presidents Barack Obama and George H.W. Bush.The hotel, which is located away from Singapore's main shopping belt and within a residential area, guarantees privacy for its guests.Crucially, it has solid experience in hosting high-security events, such as the landmark meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and then Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, and the Shangri-La Dialogue which attracts dozens of defence ministers each year.The gazetted area around Shangri-La Hotel includes other high-end hotels, including The St\u00a0Regis Singapore.While previous reports had suggested that Mr Kim's preferred choice of lodging was the Fullerton, the hotel is not within any special zones gazetted by the Government for the summit.This increases the likelihood that Mr Kim will be staying at The St\u00a0Regis instead, which is a nine-minute walk away from Shangri-La Hotel.The St\u00a0Regis was the choice hotel for the Chinese delegation in 2015, when Singapore hosted a historic meeting between Mr\u00a0Xi\u00a0and Mr Ma.Located in\u00a0Tanglin Road, a block away from the bustling Orchard Road belt, the hotel may not be able to provide the same sense of privacy that Shangri-La boasts.The hotel features 299 rooms and suites, including the lavish presidential suite on the hotel's highest floor on the 20th storey.The suite includes a bedroom, living room, dining room, office and terrace, and features a private balcony, jacuzzi, a gym and a butler service.Each room in the suite is lined with gold, and accented with brass, onyx and silver metals. The walls are adorned with hand-painted silk panels, with custom-made Czech crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.This luxurious hotel on the resort island of Sentosa was confirmed to be the venue for the summit by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday (Wednesday morning, Singapore time).The announcement came after the Singapore Government issued a public order gazetting the entire island as well as waters off its south-west beaches as a \"special event area\" from June 10 to 14.Earlier, it was reported that some US officials have been staying at the hotel, led by White House deputy chief of staff for operations Joe Hagin.The American delegation has been staying at the hotel to plan for the summit, according to previous reports.Before the summit was confirmed to be back on by President Trump, Mr Kim's de facto chief of staff Kim Chang Son was spotted spending a few hours at the Capella Singapore on May 31.Mr Kim Chang Son is believed to have been involved in high-level meetings with the American delegation, ahead of the summit.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

However, marketing experts say the coverage generated from the event could be worth more than 10 times that.\"It places Singapore on the map for international audiences,\" said Oliver Chong, executive director, communications and marketing capability at Singapore Tourism Board.Tourism contributes around 4 per cent to Singapore's GDP per annum. Visitor arrivals hit a record 17.4 million last year boosted by China, its top market, and India.But just months ago, lifestyle magazine Time Out ranked Singapore among the world's least exciting cities.Andrew Darling, CEO and founder of communications agency West Pier Ventures, said it would cost more than US$200 million to generate the kind of publicity Singapore has received so far by hosting the summit.Media intelligence firm Meltwater said the coverage over the three days around the summit equated to US$270 million of advertising, while the month leading up to it was worth US$767 million.\"The Trump-Kim Summit has arguably been the single most important event that brought Singapore to the attention of the most people around the world,\" said Jason Tan of media advertising agency Zenith Singapore.\"For many Asians, Singapore as the choice of destination reinforces our image as an efficient and safe country. For Americans who might not be as familiar with Asia, the summit definitely brought Singapore into the global spotlight.\"Online travel agent Expedia said its data showed searches from global customers for trips to Singapore had risen by 58 per cent on Jun\u00a010 and Jun 11 relative to the same days in 2017, including a 220 per cent rise in searches by US-based customers.Still, even some who should know better struggled to accurately place Singapore - known as the Little Red Dot in reference to its depiction on a map.The US\u00a0State Department mistakenly made Singapore a part of neighbouring Malaysia in a note issued in connection with the summit, drawing a slew of snide comments on social media.(US$1 = 1.3363 Singapore dollars)(Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan and John Geddie.

Both Trump and Kim smiled\u00a0and exchanged pleasantries before posing for photographs.They then adjourned to a sitting room where both Trump and Kim fielded questions. Trump spoke first and said: \"It\u2019s my honour ... We will have a terrific relationship I have no doubt.\"Speaking in Korean, Kim said that \"it was not easy to get here\" and \"the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today\".The leaders then proceeded to have a one-on-one meeting with only their translators present, before stepping out after around 40\u00a0minutes to wave at the assembled media from a balcony.\u00a0The US president described his private meeting with Kim as\u00a0\"very good, very very good\".They were later\u00a0joined by their delegations for a series of meetings.\"Working together we will get it taken care of,\" Trump told Kim at the start of the wider meeting. \"We will solve it.\"Both sides proceeded to have a scheduled\u00a0working lunch after their meetings. Among the dishes for lunch were prawn cocktail, Yangzhou fried rice and beef short rib confit.\u00a0Oiseon, a Korean stuffed cucumber, was served for starters, and Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate tartlet ganache were served for dessert.\"A lot of progress, really very positive -\u00a0better than anybody could have expected,\" Trump told the media after his lunch meeting with Kim as they strolled out of the hotel side by side. \"Top of the line, really good.\"He then added that he and Kim would be signing a document at the Singapore summit.\u00a0The two leaders even spent a short moment without their translators as they tried to build rapport between themselves. Trump even showed Kim his presidential limo, dubbed The Beast.\u00a0\"THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR CHANGE\": KIMAt around 1.40pm, the leaders emerged along with key officials\u00a0to sign a document.\u00a0\"A lot of work and a lot of preparation went into this,\" said Trump. \"The meeting went better than expected and no one could've expected this.\"Kim expressed\u00a0thanks to the US president for the summit's success.\u00a0\"We had a historic meeting and we\u2019ve decided to leave the past behind,\" he said. \"The world will see a major change. I would like to express my gratitude to President Donald Trump for making this happen.\"Both leaders shook hands again at the signing table with Trump saying he had developed a \"special bond\" with his younger counterpart.\u00a0Asked by reporters if he would invite Kim to Washington, Trump said: \"Absolutely, I would.\"\u00a0As both leaders stood on the verandah before Kim's departure from the Capella hotel, Trump said:\u00a0\"We'll meet again. We will meet many times.\" The president added that he learned Kim is a \"very talented man\" and \"loves his country very much\".Trump said Kim was a \"worthy negotiator\", adding the North Korean leader had\u00a0a \"great personality\" and was\u00a0\"very smart\".TRUMP\u00a0SAYS WILL STOP \"WAR GAMES\" WITH SOUTH KOREAIn a post-summit press conference which began at around 4.15pm, Trump spoke to the international media where he said the US will stop holding military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.Washington and Seoul are security allies and hold joint exercises every year that infuriate Pyongyang.\"We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money,\" Trump told reporters, adding that \"at some point\" he wanted to withdraw US troops from the South.Trump also added that Kim was committed to destroy a missile engine testing site, but did not elaborate further, except to say that this was agreed after the pair signed their \"comprehensive agreement\" earlier in the afternoon.On the issue of human rights, Trump said he had raised it during his meeting with Kim.\"We did discuss it today, strongly\" Trump said. \"We will be doing something on it. It's rough. It's rough in a lot of places, by the way.\"On denuclearisation, Trump said\u00a0North Korea has \u201cvery substantial\u201d nuclear arsenal, but believes the time on denuclearisation will \u201cgo very quickly\u201d.Asked by Channel NewsAsia about the cost for denuclearisation for North Korea, Trump said he think South Korea and Japan will help them \"greatly\", says \"we won't have to help them\".Sanctions however, would remain on North Korea for now, but Trump said he wants to remove them as soon as possible.\"The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor,\" Trump said. \"I hope it is soon ... at a certain point I look forward to taking them off.\"A HISTORIC DAY UNFOLDSAnticipation had been building in the lead-up to the unprecedented summit, with crowds lining the streets of Singapore when they arrived on Sunday.Both leaders left their hotels in the Orchard area of Singapore shortly after 8am local time on Tuesday as they headed for Sentosa, which is off Singapore\u2019s southern coast.The route was lined by curious on-lookers and the media, with people standing three- to four-deep in some parts taking photos and waving as they craned to catch a glimpse of the leaders. \u00a0Trump, who left at around 8.05am from the Shangri-La Hotel, tweeted en route to the summit venue on a US Supreme Court ruling.Kim left the St Regis hotel shortly before 8.15am as his convoy \u2013 comprising about 20 security, North Korean state media and official vehicles \u2013 made its way to Sentosa.Crowds also camped out at VivoCity, outside the Sentosa Gateway, and on pavements in Sentosa to take photos and wave at the passing convoys of both leaders.Kim arrived for the meeting with his sister and confidante Kim Yo Jong and his trusted aide Kim Chang Son.As the two leaders met, Singapore navy vessels\u00a0and air force Apache helicopters patrolled, while fighter jets and an Gulfstream 550 early warning aircraft circled.TRUMP BEGAN DAY ON OPTIMISTIC NOTEThe extraordinary summit -\u00a0unthinkable only months ago -\u00a0comes after the two nuclear-armed foes appeared on the verge of conflict late last year as they slung personal insults and Kim conducted nuclear and missile tests.In a series of tweets early Tuesday morning Singapore time, Trump indicated that summit preparations were \"going well and quickly\".\"We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen,\" he tweeted -\u00a0before hitting out in a subsequent post at \"haters & losers\" who see the summit itself as a risky up-front concession to Kim.Pointing at the recent release of three American hostages and Pyongyang's pledge to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests, Trump charged that \"these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say!\"\"We will be fine!\" he tweeted.Trump had also said that he would use what he says are long-honed instincts to see whether Kim was bluffing, buying time or serious.Both Kim and Trump held bilateral talks with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday, when the US president also met with the American community in Singapore at the Shangri-La Hotel.Prime Minister Lee had on Sunday said that\u00a0Singapore will spend S$20 million on the summit, adding that he hoped the historic meeting would result in a positive outcome.Kim took in the sights of the city on Monday night as he visited Gardens by the Bay and walked along the Marina Bay waterfront.He was accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards and North Korean state media personnel, as well as Singapore\u2019s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung.Since becoming North Korea's leader in late 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jong Il, Kim had made only three known international\u00a0trips\u00a0before his Singapore trip. He travelled to China twice and to the South Korean side of the truce village of Panmunjom.DEAL REMAINS TO BE SEENOn the eve of the meeting, aides from both sides were still scrambling to narrow yawning differences over \"denuclearisation\", which means vastly different things to the two parties.\"The complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation\u00a0of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept,\"\u00a0US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the eve of the summit.Pompeo added that the US was willing to offer the regime \"unique\" security guarantees, to \"provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearisation is not something that ends badly for them\".We\u2019re live on YouTube with our comprehensive coverage on the Trump-Kim summit.

And according to marketing and hospitality experts Channel NewsAsia spoke to, the summit is a priceless opportunity\u00a0for Singapore to showcase itself to the world.Preparations are well underway for Tuesday\u2019s summit, which will be held at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island,\u00a0and in the lead-up, images of Singapore have been splashed across the front pages of newspapers and television broadcasts around the world.This, said founder of marketing consultancy Kepios Simon Kemp, can help raise valuable awareness about what the country can offer.\u201cWhen I go travelling around the world, I find that a lot of people know that we exist, but they have no idea where we are on the map, and have no idea that we\u2019re not part of China,\u201d said Mr Kemp. \u201cThey have no idea how clean it is, how vibrant the city is...and once they do\u2026I don\u2019t think anything more than simple awareness is needed for people to add Singapore to their list of destinations.\u201d\u201cThe Formula 1 race has done a wonderful job in projecting Singapore\u2019s landscape, image, and beautiful skyline on a global scale, and the upcoming summit will do the same,\u201d added Lars Voedisch, managing director of PRecious Communications. \u201cThis is something that a lot of countries would pay a lot of money for.\u201dAnd when the throng\u00a0of international media land in Singapore, they will experience, according to managing director of public relations firm Asia PR Werkz Cho Pei Lin, what she terms the \u201cSingapore DNA\u201d.\u201cFrom welcoming them at Changi Airport, to our garden city, connected infrastructure and transport network, a SMART Nation, clean and efficient, and the ability to put together the summit at short notice whilst ensuring safety and security for the two delegations and Singaporeans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is an opportunity like never before to showcase Singapore to the world.\u201d\u201cAs a Singaporean, I\u2019m very proud that we are trusted by the United States and DPRK to put this together on such short notice,\u201d she added.BENEFITS TO SINGAPORE GO BEYOND TOURISM DOLLARCiting high-level meetings Singapore has hosted in the past, such as the Shangri-La Dialogue and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, Mr Voedisch added that the summit will reinforce Singapore\u2019s reputation for being a go-to destination for such meetings.This, he said, could also have benefits in attracting more foreign companies to set up shop in Singapore.\u201cIf everything goes as planned, it will re-emphasise the image that Singapore is one of the safest places on Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich company, CEO or family wouldn\u2019t want that for their families and staff?\u201d\u201cThe fact that both the President of the US and the North Korean leaders have chosen Singapore also shows that it\u2019s easily accessible,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you think about why Singapore attracts so many global and regional HQs, it\u2019s because the CEOs and decision-makers feel that it\u2019s not only a good place for them, but safe and enjoyable for their families.\u201d\u201cSo it adds to the image that Singapore can not just attract tourists, but also the best of the international workforce.\u201dMr Kemp noted that the summit would also position Singapore as having a \u201crelatively inclusive\u201d culture and society. \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting that two countries that are, perhaps, at complete opposite ends of the spectrum around the world have chosen Singapore as the place where they both feel comfortable,\u201d he said.\u201cI think that says a lot about what Singapore means to political leaders around the world.\u201dMr Voedisch added that from a political standpoint, Singapore\u2019s reputation as a \u201cneutral and trustworthy\u201d player on the international stage will also be enhanced. \u201cSingapore can also play up the image of a positive peacemaker,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an added value that can come out of that.\u201dBENEFITS EXTEND TO SENTOSA, HOTELS AS WELLThe Singapore Tourism Board (STB) noted that as with all high-profile visits, the Trump-Kim summit \u201cplaces Singapore on the map for international audiences\u201d, and \u201cshowcases Singapore as an ideal destination, especially for businesses and meetings.\u201dAnd experts pointed out that this will benefit Sentosa in particular, which has largely been perceived and marketed largely as a tourist and leisure destination.\u201cSentosa is a tropical island off a tropical island,\u201d said Mr Voedisch. \u201cSo in terms of the images, you have the greenery, landscape, and maritime shots that add to the flavour of what it\u2019s known for.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s mainly known for being an entertainment and holiday destination for families, so the summit will help Sentosa to position itself as a great place to hold meetings and events.\u201d\u201cFrom a security perspective, you can see why Sentosa is attractive for such meetings,\u201d added Mr Kemp. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to manage a small place, and you could very easily cordon off the whole island.\u201cBesides that, the idea that there\u2019s a very serious political conversation going to take place there also gives Sentosa the opportunity to show off a whole new element to its image.\u201dAnd while hotels involved in the summit \u2013 whether host hotel Capella, or the hotels the foreign delegations will be staying at \u2013 will undoubtedly have their work cut out for them, hospitality experts noted that they will experience \u201cpriceless benefits\u201d.\u201cIf you are good enough for the President of the

your needs.\u201d\u201cThis sort of branding is priceless, which is probably why they\u2019re happy to go through all the work.\u201d\u201cImagine the President is making a speech at the podium, and

Temasek Polytechnic.\u201cThe value of that kind of publicity can\u2019t be measured.\u201dThe opportunity of hosting such an event also gives hotels the chance to put their culinary and banqueting

And of course, the dining that goes with the diplomacy becomes the subject of media interest too.In summary, summits are significant. And the one Singapore is prepared to host ranks among the biggest\u00a0that have altered the course of history.Even the recent Korean summit had a precedent just 18 years ago. But one between a\u00a0US and North Korean leader\u00a0has always remained an unlikely prospect since the Americans\u00a0left the unfinished Korean War.More than half a century of pent-up anger, sanctions, sabre-rattling and diatribes between 11 US administrations and three successive North Korean leaders, have stalled nuclear disarmament talks and exacerbated tensions across the globe.This precarious backdrop sets the scene for this once unimaginable summit. And it\u2019s precisely why there is a desperate optimism in some quarters for a watershed moment, even as questions remain as to whether hot button issues like the Korean War and denuclearisation will be addressed.Writing for The National Interest, Robert E Kelly, associate professor of international relations at Pusan National University, described the summit as \"one of America's strangest meeting\" where he expected\u00a0very little and yet hoped\u00a0for the best.\"Indeed at this point, it looks to be a\u00a0nothing burger of photos and short, \u2018get to know you\u2019 meetings that yield nothing. But, again, if this meeting must happen, then let America should (sic) pull for Trump given just how important the stakes. Prove your critics wrong, Mr\u00a0President,\" he said.TURNING POINTSWhile meetings between leaders are regular features of international relations, few can be perceived as significant turning points in human history.Hark back to the height\u00a0of the Cold War, and you come across\u00a0one of the most unexpected summits to have taken place in the last hundred years \u2013 the meeting between US President Richard Nixon and his Chinese counterpart Mao Zedong in Beijing.The balance of world power underwent a tectonic shift, as the leaders from opposite sides of the political spectrum shook hands and shocked the world in February 1972.US rapprochement with the Chinese dealt the Soviets a rude awakening in their\u00a0quest for\u00a0dominance in the bipolar conflict. While there were other factors that led to the eventual Soviet downfall, Nixon\u2019s visit to China\u00a0arguably precipitated the beginning of the end of the Cold War, opened China to the rest of the world and helped in the normalisation of its relations with its adversary, Japan.\u201cFor East Asia, the last most important summit was probably the Nixon-Mao summit that changed the course of the Cold War,\u201d associate professor Bhubhindar Singh, a Northeast Asia expert from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Channel NewsAsia.The world would head in a different direction from that moment.Not long after that momentous occasion, still within the theatre of the Cold War, another memorable summit drew global attention.The famous Geneva fireside chat between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in November 1985\u00a0was another significant step towards ending the bitter conflict and the beginning of a temporary period of d\u00e9tente between the world powers.This meeting set the wheels in motion for subsequent summits between the two leaders, eventually paving the way for the end of the Cold War.Recent history has also recorded such unlikely get-togethers.The meeting between former US President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro just three years ago, was the first between an American and Cuban leader in half a century that quickly unlocked the doors to diplomatic ties.Later in the same year, the world turned its attention to Asia, and specifically Singapore.Shattering nearly seven-decades of tension, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou shook hands for almost a minute. Shifting in synchronised fashion from right to left for every camera flash to capture the historic moment, their smiles sustained throughout the handshake as a signal of solidarity.A watershed moment in cross-strait relations, said Chinese media, although hindsight might suggest\u00a0otherwise. It was historic based on its symbolism, but not the impact it had on the future.That meeting, though, put Singapore under the global spotlight as host, bringing it valuable experience in the delicate task of accommodating leaders amid political sensitivities and security concerns that could have global ramifications.\u00a0What the island nation is about to handle over the next few days is, however, a different ball game altogether, not just because of the potential for a turning point of global magnitude.Putting the historical element aside, the Trump-Kim summit draws undue attention simply because of the leaders themselves.The protracted antagonism between Washington and Pyongyang is well-documented and has consistently manifested itself in the exchanges and statements under various administrations and leaders.But the language has never been more colourful and undiplomatic \u2013 \u201clittle rocketman\u201d, \u201cdotard\u201d and \u201cshort and fat\u201d come to mind - even as US allies, Japan and South Korea\u00a0observed the tit for tat with bated breath.However, the tense state of affairs was\u00a0suddenly assuaged, partly by an inexplicable\u00a0exchange of cordial letters over the course of a week. Suddenly, the interaction took a more measured tone - perhaps even presidential as some have observed.For now, it seems all is well and good.HOSTS OF HISTORYPreparations have been underway at frenetic pace with officials from both sides conducting high-level meetings and communicating directly with their Singaporean hosts.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis were crystal clear in their appreciation of Singapore\u2019s efforts in hosting the summit when they met their counterparts. \u00a0\u00a0Singapore\u2019s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said many officials have commented that without Singapore, preparations for the summit \u201cwould not have progressed so far\u201d.\u00a0It\u2019s a testament to the country\u2019s increasingly critical role in global politics.Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan was succinct in describing the hosts sentiment during a working trip to Washington earlier in the week.\"Happy to play (its) part for world peace,\" he said, as he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton.Just before welcoming the two leaders on Sunday, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted how this historic meeting gives the country publicity.\"The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting, we did not ask for it ...\u00a0it says something about Singapore relations with the parties ...\u00a0and our standing in the international community,\" he said.\u00a0When historic events take place, the cities that host them are entered into history as well.\u00a0The most famous capitals and even the most obscure towns become synonymous with epoch-making moments.The Versailles Treaty that ended World War I, the Potsdam conference of World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement that laid the foundation for the global economic system, and just two years ago, the historic Paris Climate Agreement \u2013 all among examples of significant turning points, named and remembered after their hosts.Singapore\u2019s place among them should not be determined by the outcome of this summit, one could argue, as questions remain as to whether the meeting between Trump and Kim will be\u00a0a watershed moment.\u201cFor Kim, this meeting is important for several reasons: To gain legitimacy for himself and his country. This meeting is also important for North Korea as it is in negotiation talks with the most important threat to its regime and national security,\"\u00a0associate professor Bhubhindar Singh\u00a0said.\u201cFor Trump, this meeting is to show his ability to \u2018resolve\u2019 the most difficult issue that other American administrations have failed to achieve. In more strategic terms, a deal here would reinforce America\u2019s advantage and military presence in Northeast Asia vis-\u00e0-vis China.\"Some believe this could be just the start of\u00a0a long drawn out process, especially in the sphere of denuclearisation.\"Kim is focused on the long game. If talks go forward after June, their differences over denuclearising Korea obviously won\u2019t be resolved in a day,\" wrote Kent Harrington, a former CIA senior analyst, in a commentary.Will the summit mirror the impact of the Nixon-Mao meeting? Or will it begin a process of d\u00e9tente as did the famous fireside chat? Will it quickly open doors to diplomatic ties? Or simply be written as an inconsequential historic event, as was the Xi-Ma meeting?All we know for now is that the magnitude of what\u2019s at stake cannot be overstated: The demands for North Korea\u2019s denuclearisation, the possibility of ending the Korean War and normalising relations on the Korean Peninsula, and the impact of all this on\u00a0the region and the rest of the world.The scheduled meeting between two eccentric world leaders, with the baggage of the past and present in tow, will draw all the attention from across the globe. Journalists and officials have already descended on the island in the thousands, casting a blinding spotlight on this tiny Southeast Asian country.According to associate professor Bhubhindar Singh: \u201cThe selection of Singapore says a lot of who Singapore is \u2013 an efficient, honest, neutral country that can be trusted to hold such an important summit.\u201dSingapore \u2013 known for its efficiency, infrastructure and organisational competency \u2013 has to pull out all the stops for this one.\u00a0 It\u2019s a mammoth task to be executed within a tight schedule.The world awaits the Singapore Summit on Jun 12, 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.Convinced that the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognizing that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following:1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.3.

So for all of those reasons in our own usual Singapore way, we've taken every precaution possible. And our police, our Home Team, our military, everything is deployed and ready,\" he said in an interview with BBC.Earlier on Monday, Dr Balakrishnan was part of the Singapore delegation led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that hosted US President Donald Trump and other officials to a working lunch at the Istana. Prior to that, both Mr Lee and Mr Trump had a\u00a0one-on-one bilateral meeting.\u00a0On Sunday, Mr Lee also met with North Korean leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un at the Istana, after he was received at the Changi Airport by Dr Balakrishnan.\u00a0Mr Trump and Mr Kim are set to meet on Tuesday at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island.\u00a0A SENSE OF \"REALISTIC OPTIMISM\"And while both leaders have tried to manage expectations that the meeting is just the first step towards getting North Korea to agree to denuclearise on terms that are acceptable to all parties,\u00a0Dr Balakrishnan said there is\u00a0a sense of realistic optimism in the air.\"Well, what we are witnessing, really, is a hangover of the Cold War, and it has been nearly 70 years,\" he said.\"This is not the way conventional diplomacy would have been conducted, but perhaps you need two very unconventional leaders to have brought us to this stage.\u00a0\"So, it\u2019s based on my interactions with their staff, as well as meeting them personally up front - both are supremely confident, both are hopeful. I think at an emotional level, both of them want something significant out of this summit.\"But can the world trust Kim, that he is committed to denuclearisation and ending the Korean War?Dr Balakrishnan said: \"My sense of it is that there is a real desire for change. He said that he now wants to focus on economic development.\u00a0\"And having had the advantage of actually visiting Pyongyang, and actually seeing how much they have been able to achieve despite the legacy of the war and the sanctions, there is no doubt that the North Koreans are a determined, proud, enterprising, disciplined people.\u00a0\"And that is why I left with that sense, supposing they were allowed to participate as a normal country, open up to the world, access the technology through trade, there is so much that they could do. So I think that he is also working on that hope that this is a new phase, a new opportunity.\"\"ENORMOUS STRATEGIC IMPACT\"Hosting the summit is set to cost around S$20 million, which Dr Balakrishnan\u00a0described as an \"investment in world peace\".\"The big difference between them and us is that Southeast Asia, particularly for the original members of ASEAN, which you must remember, was formed in 1967 at the height of the Cold War and Vietnam War, is that we had peace, we had time to prove that economic openness, integration, globalisation, free trade, worked,\" he said.\u00a0\"In a sense, Singapore is the ultimate example of that paradigm. Now if you can secure peace and development in North Korea, and if you can dial down the tensions which have prevailed there for seven decades, it is going to have an enormous strategic impact.\"Dr Balakrishnan also confirmed that Singapore is footing the bill for Mr Kim's stay at the St Regis hotel.\u00a0\"Well, it\u2019s hospitality that I would have provided for him anyway,\" Dr Balakrishnan said. \"And it\u2019s all within the budget that the Prime Minister has specified, anyway.\"Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

Accomplishing this objective, even with Kim\u2019s unlikely agreement, would take more than a decade, according to US nuclear experts.That makes the Singapore summit much more relevant as a ballast for Kim\u2019s dynastic rule. He has accomplished what neither his father nor his grandfather, the state founder, could achieve.READ: Trump-Kim summit is a win regardless what happens next. A commentary.READ:\u00a0A commentary on how Kim Jong Un may have outmanoeuvred Donald Trump in Singapore.\u00a0READ:\u00a0US-North Korea summit ends without marquee achievement, but wasn't a waste, a\u00a0commentary.His major challenge now is to use arms-control negotiations to bargain for economic aid, without sacrificing the integrity of his weapons capability. The United States and South Korea, targets of the North\u2019s nuclear arsenal, can only hope that a vision of peace and prosperity would entice Kim to choose a rational way out of the crisis for survival.As for rest of the world, it has added a ninth nuclear state, equipped with intercontinental ballistic capability and therefore much more dangerous than Pakistan.Pakistani nuclear black marketeer Abdul Qadeer Khan helped Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions by providing bomb designs and centrifuge technology.The thermonuclear device North Korea exploded last September was 15 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima and theoretically could be carried by the Hwasong-15 ICBM, tested in November, to targets within an estimated range of 10,000km.Trump may have awakened to the reality, apparent to analysts for decades, that defanging the Pyongyang regime risks starting a new war on the Korean Peninsula with casualties running into millions of people on both sides of the border.DIPLOMATIC FIASCOFor all that, Trump\u2019s amateurish talks in Singapore have brought diplomatic fiasco.A four-point joint statement issued at the end of the summit was vacuous, containing no detailed roadmaps leading to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, the so-called CVID formula pushed by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hours before the summit\u2019s opening.The joint statement, while talking about building a lasting peace regime and establishing new relations, merely repeated Kim\u2019s commitment to \u201cwork toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d a largely empty phrase devoid of details or binding clause.\u00a0The bland expression was described as \u201creaffirmation\u201d of Kim\u2019s earlier declaration signed at Panmunjom at separate talks in April with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. No mention was made of the North\u2019s aggressive missile programme.The statement amounted to an astonishing retreat for Trump who came to Singapore vowing he would \u201cwalk out\u201d of the conference if Kim showed any sign of rejecting the CVID formula.With Kim\u2019s negotiators adamantly refusing to accept the denuclearisation timetable, Trump was pushed into the corner of either cancelling the talks and walking away, as he had threatened, or swallowing his pride.\u00a0Surprisingly, Trump buckled, turning the talks into a show-business event, not a summit of war and peace.Trump\u2019s inept diplomacy exhibited his lack of preparation and haphazardness. When talks got tough, Trump folded.Inexplicably, he offered to suspend US\u2013South Korean military exercises while negotiations were underway. He threw away a major bargaining chip without reciprocal concessions.\u00a0The military exercises, held three times a year for the past two decades, have sent a powerful message to the North that they can expect a robust counterattack in case of invasion.Later in the middle of a rambling news conference summing up the talks, Trump justified suspension of war games in the name of economy; like North Korea, he called them \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cexpensive\u201d to boot. He delivered more shocks by suggesting he may eventually withdraw 28,500 US ground troops from South Korea, another demand pushed by the North since the 1953 signing of the armistice.The unexpected statements dropped like thunder strikes on Seoul, where the government fights a conservative opposition campaign against Moon\u2019s rapprochement policy with the North. The Korean currency\u2019s value dropped to 1,097 won to the\u00a0US dollar, as much as three per cent, after the summit.To calm market nerves in Seoul, Moon issued a statement that the matter of US forces in Korea is strictly bilateral between Seoul and Washington, thus separate from the North Korean nuclear issue.JAPANESE REACTIONS BORDERED ON PANICReactions in Tokyo bordered on panic as removal of US forces would make Japan the first line of defence in a potential war with the North or even China.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has held three sets of talks with Trump so far, each time advising a tough stance on Kim, was so shaken that he hurriedly asked Seoul and others to help arrange a summit with Kim for himself.Cancellation of military exercises has direct bearing on Japan\u2019s security interests as the Japanese Navy sometimes participates in these exercises, and Tokyo has vital intelligence-sharing deals with both Seoul and Washington.The Kim regime has already lobbed missiles over Japan\u2019s skies during test launches that Tokyo citizens are getting used to hearing emergency sirens urging them to seek shelter during missile tests.Reactions in Beijing, Kim\u2019s main source of support, were of\u00a0quiet elation.China emerged as the biggest beneficiary from Trump\u2019s new East Asian geopolitical vision that appeared destined to remove the United States as the security linchpin in the Western Pacific.China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the joint statement showed that China\u2019s formula of \u201cfreeze for freeze\u201d was correct, referring to his proposal calling for the US to reward Kim\u2019s nuclear and missile moratorium with suspension of US-Korean military exercises, and responding to Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearisation with regime security and a peace accord.CONFUSION OVER THE MEANING OF DENUCLEARISATION In this maelstrom of terrible initiatives, Washington\u2019s confusion over Kim\u2019s nuclear challenge isn\u2019t expected to end soon.Pompeo, visiting Seoul and Beijing on summit briefing tours, reportedly said he expected Kim to complete his denuclearisation process \u2013 a huge undertaking requiring locating more than 100 secret sites related to bomb-making operations \u2013 in 30 months.The timeframe was presumably calculated to match the timetable for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.Leading nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker of Los Alamos National Laboratory, who visited North Korean nuclear sites several times estimates that completing the disarmament process would require up to 15 years.Days after the summit, the Kim regime insisted it was sticking to its own formula of \u201cphased and synchronous\u201d denuclearisation \u2013 a process of the United States matching every step of the North\u2019s denuclearisation with political and economic rewards.Indeed, the North\u2019s state media have begun spelling out what the goal of \u201cdenuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\u201d means.According to Choson Sinbo, Pyongyang\u2019s propaganda voice published in Tokyo, the formula includes as an essential condition the removal of American troops and termination of US strategic commitments providing \u201cextended nuclear coverage\u201d or a \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d for South Korea and maybe Japan as well.Ultimately, this formula is unacceptable to\u00a0the United States, South Korea or even Japan as it would mean curtailing the US's superpower role responsible for keeping Asia\u2019s peace \u2013 a tall order indeed even if it comes from Kim Jong Un.Shim Jae Hoon is a journalist based in Seoul.

Mr Lee had described the amount spent as Singapore's \"contribution to an international endeavour which is in our profound interest\".Hosting the meeting was largely seen as a public relations coup\u00a0for Singapore, with more than 2,500 journalists on the island reporting on the landmark event.The Jun 12 meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the Capella hotel on Sentosa culminated in the North Korean leader reaffirming his \"firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\".This was stated in a joint document signed by Mr Trump and Mr Kim.Since then, the US and South Korea have suspended two military exercises, following president Trump's promise at the summit to halt the war games between the two countries.But senior US officials admit there is much work to be done as negotiators thrash out the details of what they hope will be Pyongyang's \"complete, verifiable and irreversible\" disarmament.Mr Trump's administration last\u00a0Friday extended decade-old sanctions against Mr Kim's regime, citing an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" from North Korea's nuclear arsenal.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "\nTrump arrives in Singapore for summit with Kim Jong Un \n", "classes": [], "content": "\n(Source: Xinhua)\n\nSCO leaders voice expectations of future cooperationXi chairs restricted session of SCO summitXi, other SCO leaders meet press at Qingdao summitXi greets leaders attending session of 18th SCO summitWeekly choices of Xinhua photoScenery of lotus flowers in Hefei, E China's AnhuiZongzi wrapping contest held to celebrate upcoming Dragon Boat Festival in MalaysiaScenery of Hulunbuir grassland in China's Inner Mongolia"}{"head": "\nTrump arrives in Singapore for summit with Kim Jong Un \n", "classes": [], "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump (1st L) arrives in Singapore on June 10, 2018.

(Xinhua/REUTERS)WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he will meet with the top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore as originally scheduled after recent twists and turns.  Trump made the remarks at the White House after his almost two-hour meeting with a senior official from Pyongyang who delivered a personal letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump.  Washington and Pyongyang are going to start a relationship and it will start on June 12, Trump told reporters after his talks with Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the DPRK's ruling Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee. The high-level DPRK official held a two-day meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York before heading to Washington on Friday. Trump also described the widely anticipated summit as a \"get-to-know-you\" situation, saying that it \"will be a process\" and he believed the DPRK \"wants to do the denuclearization.\" \"I think you're going to have very positive results in the end,\" said Trump, who also noted that probably more than one meeting was necessary \"after years of hostility\" and \"years of hatred\" between the two countries. Meanwhile, Trump also revealed that he talked about the sanctions imposed by Washington upon Pyongyang during his meetings with Kim Yong Chol. The White House host told reporters he did not want to use the term \"maximum pressure\" anymore as the two sides were getting along with each other. Washington has kept the maximum pressure campaign against the DPRK, including slapping severe economic sanctions on the Asian country. Trump talked to reporters after escorting Kim out of the Oval Office and posing for photos, along with Pompeo, before Kim's departure.

(Xinhua/Li Peng) by Chen JianSINGAPORE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a summit meeting in Singapore on Tuesday, the first between incumbent leaders of the two countries since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.Trump kept open the possibility of ensuing meetings with Kim following the one in Singapore, which he said will hopefully start \"something big.\"\"Meeting in Singapore with North Korea (the DPRK) will hopefully be the start of something big ... We will soon see!\" he tweeted on June 5.POSITIVE STEPWhen announcing the reinstatement of the June 12 U.S.-DPRK summit, Trump said, \"It will be a beginning. I think you're going to have a very positive result in the end.\"Lee Sang-man, professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies of Kyungnam University in South Korea, viewed the DPRK-U.S. summit as a positive step toward a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\"It contributes much to the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization and lasting peace settlement,\" he told Xinhua. \"Coexistence and co-prosperity will come based on peace. With peace on the Korean Peninsula, peace will naturally come in Northeast Asia.\"Richard Haass, president of Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, said that Trump \"appears to be embracing the idea of summit as the first step of gradual progress.\"In a tweet on June 1, the scholar said, \"This is the only way to advance if we are to avoid catastrophic failure of diplomacy or catastrophic success, ie, offering up too much to get a deal in Singapore.\"Acknowledging the wide strategic and ideological divisions between the United States and the DPRK, Robert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea's Pusan National University, said, \"My expectation is that the summit will result in some small improvements, and then lead to a process that takes six months or a year.\"To extend good faith and commitment, both countries have sent out positive messages recently. Washington, in particular, seemed to have toned down the expectations for a cure-all agreement through one meeting.\"President Trump has already started to say that CVID (complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization) is unlikely and that this will take some time. So I think they're beginning to manage expectations,\" Kelly said.Dan Mahaffee, senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of Congress and the Presidency, believes that the resumption of dialogue and clearer expectations could provide a path forward.\"Hopefully ... dialogue can continue to lessen tensions, but with a realistic understanding of what are likely outcomes,\" he said.STICKING POINTS REMAINIn an encouraging sign, the DPRK decided to suspend its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests on April 21. It also dismantled its nuclear test site in the northeastern part of the country in late May.But achieving the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be a daunting challenge given the deep mistrust between Pyongyang and Washington, as well as their differences over what denuclearization would entail, experts said.\"Denuclearization means CVID for the United States, but from the viewpoint of North Korea, denuclearization means the denuclearization of the entire peninsula,\" said Masahiro Kohara, professor at the University of Tokyo.Calling for phased and synchronous measures for denuclearization, requiring reciprocal actions by the United States, what Pyongyang also wants in return for its relinquishment of nuclear weapons is a security guarantee from Washington as well as the lifting of sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the Unites States.\"Without the lifting of sanctions, the DPRK cannot exist as a normal state that normally engages in global trade and financial transactions,\" said Lee from Kyungnam University. \"The United States must guarantee there will be no regime change in the DPRK,\" he said.In addition, experts have pointed out a number of obstacles that will have to be addressed during and after the Singapore summit.\"There are many issues to discuss, from denuclearization to international assistance for North Korea,\" Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said.\"The key thing will be to establish a process by which each side moves a bit and gets rewarded with a parallel action from the other side,\" he said, adding only a win-win agreement will last for long.Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believed the tangible outcomes of the June 12 summit would be \"big-sounding, but achievable.\"Paal expected the summit to achieve \"grand objectives worded ambiguously, a tentative timetable for achieving them, and the designation of envoys to continue the process.\"\"It (the meeting) will be made to look like steps in the right direction for both sides, with details to follow,\" he said.

It also allows deliberation about what steps to take prior to the summit and during the critical period afterward.On Monday, top Democrats in the US Senate told Trump not to make a deal that leaves the DPRK with nuclear weapons. They threatened to maintain or toughen sanctions on Pyongyang if that condition were not met.The White House also said on Monday that \"powerful sanctions\" will continue unless the DPRK denuclearized.Because denuclearization faces a long and bumpy road, it is time to think which is a better approach, an easing of sanctions only after full denuclearization, or having the DPRK getting step-by-step benefits in the course?Over recent weeks, Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, demolished a nuclear test site, released three American prisoners and conducted a second summit meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Trump's offer of holding off on imposing new sanctions is a good gesture.Mindful of the long-term goal and the effort to achieve it, it is important for both countries to continue meeting each other halfway, with sincerity, so that they can achieve what they and the international community hope for.Their efforts could ultimately usher in a new era for the peninsula, one of denuclearization, peace and prosperity.Contact the writer at huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com(China Daily USA\u00a006/05/2018 page2)\u00a0\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          DPRK-US summit a go in Singapore\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "Previous reportTalks supported by Foreign Ministry, which hopes for peace on peninsulaRepublic of Korea President Moon Jae-in confirmed on Sunday the willingness of Kim Jong-un, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and US President Donald Trump to hold the first-ever DPRK-US summit as scheduled next month.Moon delivered a nationally televised address at the presidential complex, saying both Kim and Trump \"wholeheartedly\" wished the success of their summit, originally scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Sunday that China firmly supports the DPRK and US leaders' willingness to hold the summit, expecting it not only to be held as scheduled but also to successfully bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.Lu said China always has believed that direct dialogue between the United States and the DPRK is the key to resolving issues of mutual concern on the Korean Peninsula and the ministry hopes both countries can cherish the recent progress achieved on the peninsula.On Saturday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he is looking forward to the summit in Singapore. \"It hasn't changed,\" Trump said, adding that talks were progressing well.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          Singapore confirms hosting Trump-Kim summit\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "SINGAPORE -

That makes Russia the hinge of the whole grouping, though the most powerful state represented in Ufa and the one that is busy forging the new economic linkages via the BRICS and the Silk Road initiatives that will underpin the whole emerging system is China.What we are seeing in Ufa is the coalescing of the new power centre that is challenging the historic hegemony of the US and the European states.At its core is the alliance (or \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d) of China and Russia, who are now busy forging a full spectrum relationship with each other covering all aspects of their relations: political, diplomatic, economic and military.Coalescing around this core are the Eurasian states (including Belarus and Iran) who are being drawn into a Eurasian system that integrates them politically, militarily and economically with the core. These together with the Russian-Chinese core will form the Eurasian heartland.Beyond the heartland there is a group of other states linked to the heartland by a web of political, economic and security linkages.\u00a0 Of these the giants are India, Pakistan and Brazil.The key security organisation is the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\u00a0 The key economic organisation is the BRICS, now being underpinned by the new financial institutions being forged by China.\u00a0 The inner political grouping will be the Eurasian Union of which China --- via its alliance with Russia --- is a not so secret partner. The economic and trade linkages tying together the Eurasian heartland are the Eurasian Union and the Silk Road.Whilst the West seems incapable of resolving a crisis in little Greece, in Ufa a new world is being made.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

But he claims without his harsh rhetoric, their summit may never have happened.\u00a0Trump is reflecting on his evolving rhetoric in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity in Singapore.Trump, who had threatened 'fire and fury' and called Kim 'Little Rocket Man,' said: 'I think without the rhetoric we wouldn't have been here.'He suggested that past administrations had what he called 'a policy of silence' and didn't respond when rivals 'said something very bad and very threatening and horrible'.Trump added 'That's not the answer.'\u00a0He said of his rhetoric: 'I hated to do it. Sometimes I felt foolish doing it. But we had no choice.'Dennis Rodman says his trips to Pyongyang 'opened doors' ahead of the meeting between Kim Jong-Un and President Trump.\u00a0Speculation is rife that Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize following Pyongyang's commitment to the 'complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.\u00a0However, experts predict, it could be South Korea's president and not Donald Trump who will receive the award.\u00a0Peter Wallensteen, a Swedish professor specialised in international relations, told AFT that South Korean President Moon Jae-in deserved to be included if ever a prize were awarded for peace in Korea.'Actually, Moon might be the one that deserves this the most, but that would be a slap against Trump!'Geir Lundestad, who served as secretary ot the Nobel committee between 1990 and 2014 said: 'Nobel is not a prize for saints. But you don't have to push this logic to the extreme either.'\u00a0Lundestad said the efforts of Trump and Kim were welcome but there are problems with both men.\u00a0He said: 'These two people have a lot of baggage: Kim is one of the worst dictators in the world and Donald Trump is in the process of tearing down the political and economic structures that the US set up after 1945 and that have benefitted everyone.'\u00a0The European Union also praised today's 'historic summit' between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said it was 'our strong conviction that diplomacy is the only way forward towards lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula'.She said: 'Pursuing the diplomatic track is often challenging, but it is always rewarding.\u00a0This Summit was a crucial and necessary step to build upon the positive developments achieved in inter-Korean relations and on the Peninsula so far, thanks to the leadership, wisdom and determination of the President of the Republic of Korea, Moon Jae-in.The ultimate goal, shared by the entire international community and as expressed by the United Nations Security Council, remains the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The Joint Statement signed by the U.S. and DPRK leaders today gives a clear signal that this goal can be achieved.'Europe's stocks markets faltered Tuesday as initial optimism faded over US President Donald Trump's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, dealers said.Frankfurt, London and Paris had shot higher at the opening bell, in tandem with gains across Asia, but ran out of steam as the morning progressed.Analyst Craig Erlam told AFP: 'The general reaction in the markets has been fairly muted.'While the outcome of the summit is generally positive and gives reason for optimism, there may also be an element of scepticism from investors in regards to what denuclearisation means, the timescale and whether the deal will be sustained.'\u00a0Global equity markets had rallied Monday as traders brushed off a chaotic Group of Seven meeting to focus instead on Trump's summit with North Korea.However, markets were unhappy with the vague nature of the Tuesday's agreement, according to Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.He said: 'The markets began to unravel the optimism that propelled them higher on Monday, investors seemingly unsatisfied with what the vagueness of what was agreed between the US and North Korea.'\u00a0The UN's nuclear watchdog today said it would help verify future agreements between the US and North Korea to dismantle Pyongyang's atomic weapons programme.\u00a0Yukiya Amano, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency said: 'The IAEA will closely follow the negotiations to be held between the two countries to implement the outcomes of the US-DPRK Summit.'The IAEA stands ready to undertake any verification activities in the DPRK that it may be requested to conduct by the countries concerned.'According to AFP, last week Amano said the IAEA would be ready to restart inspection work in North Korea 'at short notice, within weeks, not months' if a political agreement were reached, adding that the agency would be able to mobilise 'many' staff if needed.In 2009 Pyongyang expelled IAEA inspectors from its Yongbyon nuclear site and has since refused to allow IAEA inspections on its territory.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov approved of US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Interfax reported on TuesdayLavrov said: 'The mere fact of the meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea is positive ... We are following the comments that both sides are making but we have not seen the document yet, we'll see.'\u00a0Former NBA star Dennis Rodman said President Obama had dismissed his attempts to broker peace between the US and North Korea.\u00a0During an interview with CNN, he said: 'When I met Kim Jong-un, I didn't know what to expect...but once I got to know the culture over there I felt at home.\u00a0South Korea is to seek urgent clarity from the US State Department following Donald Trump's decision to suspend annual war games between the two nations.\u00a0Some 28,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea, however, Trump announced the training drills will be curtailed.\u00a0A spokesman for the South Korean government said: 'At this point, we need to find out the precise meaning or intentions of President Trump's remarks.'President Donald Trump says he really believes North Korea's Kim Jong-un is going to make good on his promise to denuclearise.During an hour-long press conference in Singapore, he said he may be wrong about Kim, but he'll never admit it. Trump joked that he 'may stand before you in six months and say, \"Hey, I was wrong.\"'I don't know that I'll ever admit that.'President Trump said he was going to cost Canada 'a lot of money' after Justin Trudeau criticised the billionaire businessman following last week's G-7 summit.\u00a0Speaking to reporters following his meeting with Kim Jong-un, Trump\u00a0 recounted his recent tough exchanges with Trudeau. He says the Canadian leader must not have realised that Trump had televisions on Air Force One, allowing him to monitor Trudeau's news conference at the end of the G-7 summit.\u00a0The president also recounted his discussions during the G-7 summit and his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the final document.Trump says the photo taken of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others standing before him was taken as they were waiting for changes he'd requested.Trump admitted it 'didn't look friendly' but it was 'very friendly'.\u00a0German news paper Spiegel compared photographs of the two summits, with the caption: 'One week, two photographs'.\u00a0The Iranian government has warned North Korea that Donald Trump could tear up today's nuclear deal without warning.\u00a0Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, spokesman for the Iranian regime told the semi-official Fars news agency: 'We are facing a man who revokes his signature while abroad.'\u00a0Nobakht's remarks are the first by an Iranian official after Trump and Kim concluded their nuclear summit. While flying for talks with Kim on Sunday, Trump rejected an agreement signed by the leaders of the G-7 countries at their summit in Canada. The US also pulled out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May. President Donald Trump says he thinks 'we'll probably need another summit'- or at least a second meeting - with North Korea's Kim Jong-un as they discuss Kim's commitment to denuclearisation.But Trump told reporters in Singapore on Tuesday that he and Kim were able to cover far more ground than he'd expected. He says, 'We're much further along than I would have thought.'\u00a0He told reporters following the meeting that North Korea has 'a substantial arsenal' of nuclear weapons and suggested today's meeting should have happened five years ago.\u00a0Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the joint statement signed by President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore as a first step in the denuclearisation of North Korea.He said: 'We see this as a step in a comprehensive resolution.'\u00a0Japan wants North Korea to agree to a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.In the joint statement Kim committed North Korea 'to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula'.Abe added that he 'would like to thank the president (Trump) for raising the abduction issue,' referring to Japan's demand that Pyongyang release any remaining Japanese people it abducted to train its spies.\u00a0China suggested on Tuesday that sanctions relief could be considered for North Korea if the country abides by United Nations resolutions, as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work for denuclearisation.China has signed up for increasingly tough UN sanctions against its isolated neighbour following Pyongyang's repeated nuclear and missile tests, but has always said sanctions should be accompanied by talks for a political resolution.Speaking in Beijing following Trump and Kim's signing of a joint statement at the end of their historic summit in Singapore, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China has always strictly abided by all UN resolutions on North Korea.He said: 'The UN Security Council resolutions that have been passed say that if North Korea respects and acts in accordance with the resolutions, then sanction measures can be adjusted, including to pause or remove the relevant sanctions.'\u00a0President Donald Trump says he had planned to place another 300 sanctions on North Korea recently, but he held off because it would be 'disrespectful' ahead of the meeting.Trump said Tuesday at a news conference in Singapore following his summit with Kim Jong-un that the U.S. will remove the sanctions already in place when they're assured that the nuclear weapons 'are no longer a factor.'He also says that it takes 'a long time to pull off complete denuclearisation' but that he will push for North Korea to remove its nuclear weapons as fast as it can 'mechanically and physically' be done. Trump has appeared largely unconcerned about the implications of feting an authoritarian leader suspected of ordering the public assassination of his half brother with a nerve agent, executing his uncle by firing squad and killing US college student Otto Warmbier.But Trump says without Warmbier's death, his meeting with Kim may not have happened. He says, 'Otto did not die in vain.'Trump says human rights did come up during the talks, albeit briefly.Trump says Kim Jong Un has accepted his invitation to visit the White House sometime in the future.The timing of the visit is not yet known.\u00a0Today's visit to Singapore was the furthest Kim Jong-un has travelled from North Korea since taking over from his late father.\u00a0Trump later said he was open to visiting the North Korean capital Pyongyang.\u00a0Donald Trump said he wants to halt ongoing war games with South Korea and believes in the future he might be able to pull US troops out of the region.\u00a0Speaking to the media after the US-North Korean talks, he announced the major policy shift.\u00a0The US has had a continuous presence in the Korean peninsula since the 1950s.\u00a0He also said he discussed the issue of human rights with the dictator.\u00a0Trump suggested halting the regular war games will save the United States 'a lot of money'.\u00a0He said: 'The war games are very expensive, we pay for the majority of them. Under the circumstances, that we're negotiating ... I think it's inappropriate to be having war games.'Trump says talks with Kim 'honest', 'direct', 'productive' after the North Korean dictator agreed to destroy a major missile engine testing site.\u00a0The US president was addressing the media following his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un.Trump said Kim want's to 'de-nuclearise' the Korean peninsula and the president admitted he 'trusts' his his North Korean counterpart.\u00a0He said he was 'prepared to start a new history' with the hermit state.\u00a0Kim Jong-un left Singapore without addresssing the international media.\u00a0Donald Trump has secured Kim Jong-un's agreement to return the remains of some 7,800 US troops who remain unaccounted for during the 1950-53 Korean War.\u00a0In a joint statement signed by the leaders Tuesday, the countries committed to the recovery of the remains and the immediate repatriation of those already identified.\u00a0The statement was otherwise filled with vague aspirational vows for peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Efforts to recover and return the remains have been stalled for more than a decade because of the North's nuclear development.North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has left the historic summit with US President Donald Trump to return to his hermit state.\u00a0Kim spent 45 minutes in a one-on-one meeting with Trump, with only a pair of interpreters in the room to help with the talks.\u00a0Commenting on the talks, President Trump praised his North Korean counterpart, claiming he was 'very worthy, very smart negotiator'.\u00a0Trump says Kim has a 'great personality' and is 'very smart. Good combination.'Trump also says he learned Kim is 'a very talented man' and 'loves his country very much.'Former professor, Michel Riesen, who taught Kim when he was around 14-years-old in Switzerland says he would have absolutely\u00a0learned basic English.\u00a0\u00a0'He was a good student, but he wasn't extraordinary,' Riesen told NBC's Keir Simmons.Former White House National Security Council China director Paul Haenle branded the solo meeting between Donald Trump and and Kim Jong-un as 'a bad idea'.\u00a0Mr Haenle, who served in the Obama and George W Bush administrations said: 'I could see Trump giving up a lot for very little in return.'Retired US Army general Barry McCaffrey was also concerned. He said the nature of the meeting was an 'unacceptable danger to U.S. national security.'He said: 'NSC should have TRANSCRIPT of all interactions with brutal, nuclear armed dictator.'Shanghai stocks recovered from early losses to end higher on Tuesday, as sentiment improved after US.President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a 'comprehensive' deal aimed at the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.The blue-chip CSI300 index ended 1.2 per cent higher at 3,825.95 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index ended up 0.9 per cent at 3,079.80 points, snapping a three-session losing streak.According to AP, there were no immediate details on the contents of the document, but Donald Trump said he expected the denuclearisation process to start 'very, very quickly'.\u00a0Some called it the \u2018bad hair summit\u2019 or branded it the \u2018hair conference' or \u2018hair battle spectacular'.\u00a0And thanks to the magic of Photoshop, social media was full of memes poking fun and mocking Trump and Kim for their unconventional hairstyles.The portly leaders are both known to enjoy their food. Kim reportedly has packed on weight so he could emulate his powerful grandfather.Trump notched just below obese in his first White House physical and is trying to lose 10 to 15 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0US President Donald Trump said the North Korean denuclearisation process would be starting 'very quickly', as he and Kim Jong Un signed an unspecified document.US president Donald Trump said his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un went 'better than anybody could have expected'.\n\t    Share what you think\n          The comments below have not been moderated.We are no longer accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}{"head": "Dennis Rodman arrives in Singapore for Trump-Kim nuclear summit", "classes": ["author-section", "byline-plain", "byline-section", "count-number", "count-text", "rc-title", "bdrgr2"], "content": "By\n\nDavid Martosko, Us Political Editor For Dailymail.com\n\n\nPublished:\n  18:28 BST, 11 June 2018\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  00:21 BST, 12 June 2018\n\n         473View  comments\n\t    Share what you think\n          The comments below have not been moderated.We are no longer accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"}{"head": "Trump begins Singapore summit with birthday cake at the palace", "classes": ["author-section", "byline-plain", "byline-section", "count-number", "count-text", "rc-title", "bdrgr2"], "content": "By\n\nFrancesca Chambers, White House Correspondent For Dailymail.com In Singapore\n\nPublished:\n  06:33 BST, 11 June 2018\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  21:43 BST, 11 June 2018\n\n        1.2kView  commentsGood Luck!

the bright city lights from its rooftop garden and infinity swimming pool.Surprised guests enjoying the relative cool of the tropical evening took pictures of a waving Kim with their cameraphones.On

"classes": [], "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (C) walks with his delegates as they visit the Jubilee bridge at the Esplanade in Singapore, June 11, 2018. US President Donald J. Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet at the Capella Hotel in Sentosa for a historic summit on June 12, 2018.Francesco Mancini is the Associate Dean, Co-Director, and Visiting Associate Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, as well as an Adjunct Associate Professor at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. New Europe\u2019s Federico Grandesso spoke in an exclusive interview with Mancini about the upcoming meeting in Singapore between US President Donald J. Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un.NE: First of all, why do you think Singapore was selected as the best location for the summit?\u00a0Singapore is truly a natural location for what we can call so-far the \u201csummit of the century.\u201d It is a friendly nation across the globe. It has had diplomatic ties with North Korea since 1975 and good relations with both the US and China. Singapore would not be a home turf for Kim, as opposed to anywhere near the DMZ, but he will still be in a friendly country.North Korea has an embassy in Singapore\u2019s central business district, which can help with the elaborate logistical and protocol requests that will be part of the summit. It is also an ideal venue for the US as it is a large trading partner, the second-largest Asian investor and a long-time supporter of US military presence in the region. Its prime minister, Lee, has already been received at Trump\u2019s White House. The Asian city-state can guarantee excellent security at the summit, due to the efficiency of its security forces and territorial control.Also, Singapore is closer than Europe for North Korea and allows for Kim\u2019s private jet to reach the summit without having to refuel, and is not near the US, which means that Kim does not have to travel a longer distance than Trump. Finally, Singapore already has experience in hosting unprecedented summits. In 2015, it hosted a meeting between China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, the first time the leaders met since 1949.NE: Who is going to benefit the most from this summit?I see already two clear winners. One is Singapore, as the host. It has put the country in the global news cycle and since this summit is more an event than an actual summit, Singapore has received a huge press exposure. News outlets are in Singapore for 4-5 days broadcasting their news from here, like they would do during the Olympics or a World Cup. That is quite extraordinary.Whatever happens after the summit, everybody will remember that the famous handshake happened in Singapore. The second obvious winner, even before going into the meeting, is Kim. He has managed to achieve three goals at once. First, he is not a pariah leader anymore. He has secured a summit with the US president, he has travelled to China and was visited by the Russians. He has basically legitimized North Korea as a nuclear state. And third, he has successfully loosened the grip on sanctions.As for Trump, he has secured a photo op of the century, even if nothing comes out of it. Notcoincidentally, the handshake should happen around 9 am Singapore time, primetime in the US.NE: What do you see coming out of the discussions?My expectation is that not much substance will be discussed at the summit. Trump might propose to move toward peace, not a full peace treaty (which requires US Senate approval and is politically difficult right now), but a pacification of the relations between the US and North Korea. He might even invite Kim to Mar-a-Lago to continue the conversation. But the details will not be there. These will be left to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former spy chief Kim Yong-chol to sort out.A long process is probably ahead.NE: How do you see the position of China in this regard?The fact is this is a long process that plays in favour of China. Today, the US may outshine China, but China will be the winner. A declaration of an agreement to end the Korean War is something that will undermine the rationale of keeping American troops in the Korean Peninsula. China\u2019s position will be much stronger in the future, while the US will be weaker.China will become the key guarantor for North Korea, as well as an economic investor. China has so far played their hand beautifully and will be able to play, but with far larger strategic consequences. The real loser here is Japan, who risks being left out of the whole process. Trump has indicated that he is likely going to insist that Kim give up his ICBMs, but not shorter range weaponry. A fact that remains a key issue for Japan.NE: Can we hope for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula in the future?Regarding de-nuclearisation, I think CVID is pretty much off the table now. Kim has no reason to give up his nuclear capacity and reason to. It remains his ace in the hole when he needs it. He might commit to a process toward no proliferation and no ICBM capability, which might be enough to get some economic help that he so desperately needs.Trump might be happy enough with getting rid of IBMs, because he\u2019ll look like he\u00a0ensured the safety of US territory and I don\u2019t think he cares about anything else. Again, it will be up to Pompeo to follow up on and to develop a plan for disarmament, and in this long process, China will, again, be a key influence due to its long-term strategy. In other words, the US and North Korea will have to start to playing the game of strategic reassurance. Credible assurance means both sides would have to forego their strategy of threat escalation. China and South Korea end up being key to this assurance game.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "North Korea Summit Yields Trump Political Victory But Not Binding Commitments", "classes": ["p1", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2", "p2"], "content": "South Korean newspapers show US President Donald J. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during their historic meeting in Singapore; June 13, 2018. \bDonald Trump and Kim Jong-Un signed a \u201chistoric\u201d document concluding the unprecedented summit between a US president and a North Korean leader. Trump described the agreement as \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and characterised it as embodying substantial commitments. Let\u2019s analyse the agreement to see what was actually agreed. The agreement recites \u201cPresident Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK,\u201d whilst Kim Jong-un \u201creaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Following this preamble, and a recognition that relations between the US and North Korea would be good for world peace, and confidence building can \u201cpromote\u201d denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the two leaders \u201cstated\u201d four matters.\u00a0 These are: first, the two sides committed to establish \u201cnew \u2026 relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity;\u201d second, they will \u201cjoin their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula;\u201d third, North Korea reaffirms the \u201cApril 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration \u2026[and] commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula;\u201d and fourth, they \u201ccommit to recovering POW/MIA remains\u201d and repatriate already identified remains. The agreement closes with a commitment \u201cto implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously,\u201d and hold further talks. This is not a legal agreement. It is merely a political agreement \u2013 both sides are making promises that cannot be enforced legally. A legal agreement \u2013 a treaty \u2013 is qualitatively different to this agreement signed by Trump. Under article 2, section 2, clause 2 of the US constitution, the president \u201cshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.\u201d This is an executive agreement \u2013 concluded solely by the president of the US. And he can terminate it when he pleases. Notably, the Iran nuclear deal or JCPOA was also an executive agreement. It was terminated solely by the president. So, Trump or his successor can rip this agreement with Kim to bits. If Kim was seeking a meaningful deal, based on the recent experience with JCPOA, he would have been safer with a treaty. To be sure, a treaty was unlikely because there was insufficient time to secure agreement on key matters. Then, the text shows the parties have not made substantial commitments. The first promise says \u201cPresident Trump\u201d \u2013 as distinct from the United States \u2013 \u201ccommitted to provide security guarantees to the DPRK.\u201d This is significant. The president committing to provide a security guarantee is arguably different from the US making such a promise. What kind of \u201csecurity guarantee\u201d can Trump provide? He can promise to abstain from regime change as long as he is in office. No more. Even if the US had entered into a non-aggression pact \u2013 a legal agreement \u2013 with DPRK, it would not mean much. History proves great powers rarely tie their hands and eliminate aggression when it is in their self-interest. Notably, the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact concluded between Hitler and Stalin in 1939 pledged non-aggression against each other. It was meaningless in the end. Similarly, the security guarantee would be worthless if North Koreans revolt against Kim or if North Korea threatens the US. No US president would be able to justify protecting a dictator suppressing his own people. The political cost would be too high. Obviously, if Kim threatens the US, the \u201csecurity guarantee\u201d would also be rendered nought. The commitment to \u201cdenuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u201d despite its \u201cunwavering\u201d and \u201cfirm\u201d nature, is similarly meaningless. As noted previously, \u201cdenuclearization\u201d has not been defined, and the US and DPRK disagree on its meaning. Turning then to the four statements, the first three are anodyne promises that don\u2019t entail any significant change. Neither party is giving up anything. The fourth promise \u2013 to recover and repatriate POW/MIA remains is meaningful. It represents a good gesture by Kim. If the promises are not legally binding, what do they tell us about the parties\u2019 intentions?Given that the commitments are non-legal, the context helps to understand intentions and forecast future developments.While we don\u2019t know much about Kim\u2019s perspective, the KCNA reports that \u201cKim Jong-un clarified the stand that if the US side takes genuine measures for building trust in order to improve the DPRK-US relationship, the DPRK, too, can continue to take additional goodwill measures of the next stage commensurate with them.\u201d In other words, not yielding much. We have good contextual information about Trump\u2019s views from his press conference post summit. Trump believes that Kim recognises the \u201ctremendous potential for North Korea.\u201d There is \u201cno limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up nuclear weapons,\u201d and \u201cthese are truly gifted people.\u201d Second, echoing Kim, the president said \u201cthe past does not have to define the future\u201d and \u201cadversaries can indeed become friends.\u201d This de-couples future initiatives from the previous failed record. Third, Trump said \u201conly the most courageous can make peace\u201d \u2013 seeming to break from his previous aggressive posture. Fourth, the agreement evidences an \u201cunwavering commitment to complete denuclearization,\u201d \u201cit will be verified,\u201d and \u201cthe language is very strong.\u201d Fifth, he accepted that \u201cit takes a long time to pull off denuclearization \u2026scientifically it takes time \u2026\u201d but \u201cwhen you hit a certain point you can\u2019t go back.\u201d Sixth, in a gesture of goodwill, Trump promised to \u201cstop the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money plus \u2026 it is very provocative.\u201d Again, making a significant departure from past practice, Trump diplomatically stated it is \u201cinappropriate to be having war games\u201d when \u201cwe are signing a comprehensive agreement.\u201d This is a sign of goodwill. Seventh, \u201csanctions will remain\u201d until \u201cthe menace of nuclear weapons \u2026[are] removed.\u201d Trump claimed that he looks \u201cforward to taking them off.\u201d Eighth, human rights issues were \u201cdiscussed relatively briefly,\u201d but \u201cwill be discussed more in the future.\u201d\u00a0Ninth, Trump seems to recognise the dangers of military conflict and the severe risks of massive casualties. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be threatening,\u201d \u201cSeoul has 28 million people \u2013 its right next to DMZ\u201d and \u201cyou could have lost 20 million people, 30 million people.\u201d Tenth, Trump thinks North Korea is to be trusted this time because Kim \u201cdid not have confidence in a president previously\u201d and \u201cbecause it is a different president.\u201d Comparing the two positions, the agreement represents a first step in a long journey. In the final analysis, this is probably the best outcome in a bad situation. A major opening up of North Korea is unlikely because of entrenched doctrines of juche and songun (self-reliance and military-first). The regime\u2019s Ten Principles also firmly set out Kim Jong-un-ism as the non-negotiable and foundational attribute of the country. In such circumstances, a major transformation would be suicide for Kim \u2013 if North Koreans are told to revise their views about the US and embrace capitalism they might topple Kim and seek justice for past wrongs. Therefore, Trump could only secure an agreement that may provide the foundation for a legal agreement in the future. It is a minor victory.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Singapore says founding father Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s condition has worsened", "classes": [], "content": "    Singapore founding father Lee's condition worsens     Associated Press - 17 March 2015 05:17-04:00      SINGAPORE  (AP) \u2014 Singapore's government says the condition of the country's 91-year-old founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, has worsened.\n    Lee has been at Singapore General Hospital since Feb. 5, when he was admitted for severe pneumonia and was later put on life support.\n    The Prime Minister's Office said in a statement Tuesday that Lee's \"condition has worsened du...This story is part of New Europe's Premium content.\u00a0\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "EU and Singapore successfully on Trade and Investment Protection Agreements", "classes": ["p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1"], "content": "European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom (L) and AEM Chairman and Singapore Trade Minister Lim Hng Kiang (R) walk past the flag of the European Union for a press conference after concluding the 16th ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM)-European Union Trade Commissioner Consultation meeting at the Shangri-La hotel l in Singapore, 02 March 2018. The European Commission has given the green light to clear\u00a0an EU-Singapore trade and investment agreements that aim to take\u00a0bilateral relations to a new level and comes\u00a0on the heels of the recently signed EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement,The speed by which Brussels moved to wrap-up both agreements is being seen as an effort to\u00a0send a strong message to US President Donald J. Trump\u00a0about the EU\u2019s approach to fair and rules-based international trade.The EU-Singapore pacts are the first bilateral trade and investment agreements concluded between the EU and a Member State of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and will serve as a reference point for other trade and investment agreements,\u00a0including negotiations between the EU and Malaysia\u00a0that were launched in 2010, as well as similar ongoing talks between the EU, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia that began in 2012.The EU-Singapore deal is the most significant as the wealthy city-state is by far the EU\u2019s largest ASEAN partner, with total bilateral trade in goods at \u20ac53.3 billion in 2017 and services at \u20ac44.4 billion in 2016.Unlike past agreements, the EU-Singapore trade agreement is one of the first \u2018new generation\u2019 bilateral agreements that not only remove customs duties and non-tariff barriers for trade in goods and services but also includes important provisions on intellectual property protection, investment liberalisation, public procurement, competition, and sustainable development.According to the European Commission, the day the trade agreement enters into force, over 80% of all imports from Singapore will enter the EU duty-free.\u00a0European tariffs will be removed within three or five years for the remaining 20%, depending on the product category.Electronics, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and processed agricultural products will be prioritised, as the deal removes technical and non-tariff barriers to trade in these specific goods.The EU and Singapore have also agreed to base their technical and safety regulations\u00a0on international standards. Both sides also agreed to promote international safety and manufacturing standards for cars and car parts, outside of the electronics industry.Both Brussels and Singapore\u00a0will conform to international standards and guidelines for pharmaceutical products and medical devices, particularly those developed by\u00a0global standard-baring bodies.Enhanced customs cooperation will simplify and modernise trade procedures\u00a0and cut transaction costs for businesses. Singapore will make it easier for EU companies working in the fields of telecommunications, environmental services, engineering, computing, and maritime transport to operate in the country, a move that was reciprocated by the EU, which ruled that European commercial banks will, under specific conditions, be able to increase their number of customer services locations.Singapore has agreed to strengthen its existing geographical indications (GI) regime by setting up a system to register GIs in Singapore. Around 190 GIs for wines, spirits, and certain agricultural products including Bordeaux wines, Parma ham, Champagne, and Bayerisches Bier will be treated as being within the EU Member States.The agreements will first have to be approved by the European Council and sent to the European Parliament before possibly coming into force before the mandate of the Juncker Commission ends in May 2019.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Singapore and Europe: 50 Years of relations", "classes": [], "content": "Singapore: The 2015 marks the 50th year of Singapore\u2019s independence.\u00a0 This is a chance to reflect on how far we have come as a nation since independence was suddenly thrust upon us in 1965.\u00a0 Singapore had to contend with high unemployment, low education levels, a shortage of housing and poor living standards.\u00a0 We needed to build a military and diplomatic service from scratch, and above all foster a new national identity.\u00a0 Against the odds, Singapore managed to not only survive but prosper, lifting itself from third world to first.\u00a0 We now consistently rank as one of the most liveable places in the world; the unemployment rate has not exceeded 6% for over 25 years (it currently stands at 2%); more than 90% of Singaporeans own their homes; and half of our labour force has tertiary education.\u00a0 A Singaporean born today can expect to live to 82, 16 more years than the average life expectancy of a citizen born five decades ago. \u00a0As a small country, Singapore has always understood the importance of international connections and an open economy.\u00a0 Since the founding of modern Singapore, usually dated to Sir Stamford Raffles\u2019 establishment of a trading post on our island in 1819, Singapore has served as a major hub connecting Asia and Europe.\u00a0 Landmarks in Singapore such as Waterloo Street and the Fullerton Hotel bear witness to these early links.\u00a0 Many European firms, including Siemens and Shell, have long histories in Singapore spanning more than a century.\u00a0 Their enduring presence is a reminder of the synergistic nature of Singapore-Europe relations.\u00a0 Europe has also been instrumental to Singapore\u2019s post-independence success. Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK were among the first to recognise Singapore as a sovereign state.\u00a0 Our navy\u2019s first gunboats were jointly-produced by German and British firms, while our first military pilots were trained in the UK.\u00a0 On the economic front, the late Dutch economist Dr Albert Winsemius was a key architect of our export-driven development strategy.The Singapore-Europe relationship has blossomed into a deep and comprehensive\u00a0partnership that is based on enduring mutual interestsThe Singapore-Europe relationship has blossomed into a deep and comprehensive partnership that is based on enduring mutual interests.\u00a0 At the political level, Singaporean and European leaders regularly exchange visits.\u00a0 At the people-to-people level, over 1.5 million Europeans visited Singapore in 2013. The 60,000-strong European community in Singapore has greatly enriched our society.\u00a0 As for economic links, the EU is the largest investor in Singapore, while Singapore is the EU\u2019s second-largest Asian investor.\u00a0 Bilateral trade amounts to over \u20ac60bn per year.\u00a0 Defence relations remain strong, with equipment purchases flowing in both directions.\u00a0 Cultural ties are similarly flourishing \u2013 2015 will see a number of cultural events held in various European cities to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Singapore\u2019s independence.\u00a0 These include the Singapore Festival in France 2015 and Singapore\u2019s return to the Venice Biennale.The Singapore-Europe relationship will undoubtedly continue to evolve, in no small part due to the important changes taking place in the world today.\u00a0 Propelled by the rapid growth of emerging economies such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam, the 21st century will make the Asia-Pacific a dynamic region.\u00a0 The 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (\u201cAPEC\u201d) economies represent 55% of the world\u2019s GDP and conduct 44% of its trade.\u00a0 The Asian Development Bank further predicts that, by 2050, Asia could account for more than half of global GDP, trade and investment.\u00a0 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (\u201cASEAN\u201d), comprising ten Southeast Asian countries (including Singapore), lies at the heart of the dynamic Asia-Pacific region.\u00a0 In 2015, the ASEAN countries are due to form an ASEAN Economic Community, a single market and production base with 600 million consumers and a strong economic outlook.\u00a0 The ASEAN economy will be one of the top ten economies in the world today.Europe\u2019s long-term prosperity will be enhanced if it fully taps into the economic vibrancy of ASEAN. The EU is in a good position to step up its engagement through fora such as the ASEAN-EU Dialogue Partnership, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the Asia-Europe Meeting. I welcome the EU\u2019s decision to appoint its first dedicated Ambassador to ASEAN.\u00a0 The EU has also embarked on bilateral trade negotiations with Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, all of which will serve as building blocks for deeper region-to-region economic collaboration.\u00a0 Against this backdrop, the recently-concluded EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (\u201cEUSFTA\u201d) and EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cESPCA\u201d) take on special significance.The EUSFTA will bring substantial benefits to both parties.\u00a0 The EU enjoys a \u20ac11.6bn trade surplus with Singapore, and will benefit from the tariff-free access and recognition of Geographical Indications.\u00a0 European companies in Singapore, which currently number 10,400, will benefit from ASEAN cumulation and Singapore\u2019s network of FTAs to increase their exports to rapidly-growing markets.\u00a0 It is estimated that the EUSFTA will boost EU exports to Singapore by \u20ac1.4bn and EU real GDP by \u20ac550m over 10 years. \u00a0 The EUSFTA will also stimulate green growth by removing obstacles to trade and investment in environmentally-friendly technologies.\u00a0 Strategically, the EUSFTA \u2013 the EU\u2019s first such agreement with a Southeast Asian country \u2013 will enhance the EU\u2019s engagement of Asia, and serve as a springboard to an eventual EU-ASEAN FTA.\u00a0 It is therefore vital that the EU ratifies the EUSFTA as soon as possible and send a strong signal that Europe remains open for business.\u00a0 Such bilateral initiatives, along with mooted region-to-region agreements like the EU-ASEAN Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement, will augment connections, boost growth and create jobs to the benefit of the EU\u2019s and ASEAN\u2019s 1.1 billion citizens.Even as we celebrate Singapore\u2019s 50th birthday, we are not resting on our laurels; we are now looking forward to the next 50 years.\u00a0 We are investing in our people by providing rigorous and broad-based education up to the university level and implementing bold social policies.\u00a0 In particular, we are focussing extensively on ensuring that our young people can access skills-based education, and not just focus on getting a university degree, so that they can compete in the modern world economy.\u00a0 We are also enhancing our physical infrastructure by doubling our train network and expanding our airport.\u00a0 In the next 50 years, we hope to become an exceptional global city with a thriving economy, where Singaporeans have good jobs whilst enjoying a high-quality life with families and friends.\u00a0 In realising this vision, we remain committed to the values that have underpinned our success \u2013 incorruptibility, meritocracy, multi-culturalism, democracy and openness to the world \u2013 values that Europe shares.

She said Washington was in continuing communication with the North Korea government and added: \"We look forward to them following through on their commitments and agreements that they made last week at the summit.\"At the Singapore summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, Kim reaffirmed a commitment to \"work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\", while Trump said he would end \"provocative\" joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises.Although Trump has hailed the Singapore summit as a success, sceptics have questioned whether he achieved anything new, given that Pyongyang, which has rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament, appeared to make no new concrete commitments.The United States has led an international sanctions drive to press North Korea to abandon development of nuclear weapons capable of reaching the United States and Trump has expressed concern that China may be easing up on its enforcement of these steps.South Korea and the Pentagon announced they would halt the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian military drill scheduled for August.At the summit, Trump also said North Korea had agreed to return remains of U.S. soldiers missing from the 1950-53 Korean War and U.S. officials said on Tuesday that that process could start within the next few days.While not formally billed as a state visit, China gave Kim most of the trappings of one, including a welcome ceremony with honour guard in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.Xi greeted Kim warmly, in images carried on state television. The two men were accompanied by their wives.Xi said he was pleased to see North Korea's decision to promote economic reforms, adding that China's own reform and opening up process had meant the Chinese people's eyes had been open to the world. North Korean state media had not mentioned Kim's visit by early evening.A Kim trip to China to discuss his summit with Trump had been widely anticipated in diplomatic circles. China is North Korea's most important diplomatic and economic backer but has been angered by its nuclear and missile tests.South Korea's foreign ministry spokesman said South Korea and China shared the strategic goal of completely denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\"Our government hopes China will play a constructive role in resolving this problem,\" ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-deok told a regular briefing. \"We hope Chairman Kim Jong Un's visit will contribute to that.\"'DUAL SUSPENSION'China has welcomed the warming of ties between the United States and North Korea, and offered to help. It has been particularly pleased by Trump's decision to suspend military drills with South Korea. It has long proposed a \"dual suspension\", whereby North Korea stops weapons tests and the United States and South Korea stop military drills, to encourage talks.\"South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom Guardian military drill scheduled for August,\" South Korea's defence ministry said in a statement. The Pentagon confirmed the suspension, adding that the secretaries of defence and state as well as Trump's national security adviser would meet on the issue this week.Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops joined the Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills, although the exercise is mostly focussed on computerized simulations rather than field exercises.The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.The decision to halt military exercises in South Korea has bewildered many current and former U.S. defence officials, who only learned about it when Trump announced it in Singapore, after the summit with Kim.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which regularly practise to deter North Korea. \"The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations' defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan,\" Suga told a regular briefing.Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said the decision to suspend the U.S.-South Korean exercises was made to support the diplomatic effort between the United States and North Korea but added it was \"important to be wary of North Korea actions\".\"Our view of the threat has not changed. Joint training is an important in maintaining peace and stability in the region,\" he said.

The president announced Saturday that he was pulling the U.S. out of the Group of Seven's official statement of common values and accusing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host of the conference, of \"false statements.\"But with the G-7 in his rearview mirror, Trump seemed ready to focus on North Korea. At a minimum, he said, he wants to begin a relationship and, he predicted, it won't take him long to figure out whether Kim is genuinely interested in a making a deal that includes denuclearization.\"I think within the first minute, I'll know \u2014 just my touch, my feel,\" he said."}{"head": "Final preparations under way for historic summit", "classes": ["submenu-tv-live-text", "submenu-tv-live-text"], "content": "Watch Euronews live streamWatch Euronews live streamFinal preparations under way for historic summitFinal preparations are being made for the historic summit between US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim-Jong-un.Delegations from both sides were working behind the scenes to smooth the process ahead of the meeting, with both leaders announcing they would leave immediately after the summit.While Trump was optimistic about its prospects, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo injected a note of realism, urging caution.\"The ultimate objective we seek from diplomacy with North Korea has not changed,'' he said.

He flew in his personal Ilyushin-62M jet accompanied by a cargo plane that people with knowledge of North Korean affairs say is believed to have carried his limousine.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"It looks very much like the trip to Dalian was a dry run,\" said Andray Abrahamian, a research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS and formerly with Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group that trains North Koreans in business skills.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At 4,700 km from Pyongyang's Sunan airport, Singapore is easily in the range of the Il-62M aircraft. The Soviet-era narrow-body jet with four engines was first introduced in the 1970s and has a maximum range of 10,000 km.But the Ilyushin-76 cargo plane cannot fly more than 3,000 km without refuelling if carrying a full load. It will therefore have to stop off at a friendly location like Vietnam\u2019s capital on the way to Singapore or fly with a reduced load.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Il-76, originally designed for moving heavy machinery to remote parts of the Soviet Union, is big enough to fit a school bus or two shipping containers inside it, according to passenger and cargo flight operator Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But the cargo plane has had some safety issues. In the latest incident last month, a crash killed 257 people on board after takeoff from an Algiers air base.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike his father Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011 and who travelled by armoured train on his rare trips abroad because he feared being shot down, according to a North Korean defector familiar with his security details, the younger leader is not known to be averse to flying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But air travel of this distance does pose a significantly greater challenge in transporting communication and security equipment and personnel needed to back up a summit meeting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUITE FIT FOR A LEADER\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lee Yun-keok, a defector who had worked for the North's government and now heads the North Korea Strategic Information Service Center in Seoul, said the trip will involve dozens of security personnel and equipment including possibly a personal toilet for the leader.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It will also mean burning a large quantity of jet fuel, a refined oil product sharply limited by U.N. sanctions targeting North Korea\u2019 imports. Kim's two planes will need around 50 metric tons of jet fuel per aircraft for the flight from Pyongyang to Singapore. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0China, the main source of fuel for the North, exported just 3 tons of jet fuel in March and made no official exports the two previous months, according to Chinese customs data. But the North's planes can pick up extra fuel when they fly to China and Russia for commercial operations, and international security experts believe the North may have been stockpiling the fuel which it has also used for its missile programme. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe United States had preferred Geneva,\" the South Korean presidential official told reporters, requesting anonymity to discuss the arrangements for the summit meeting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"But Singapore was selected as it was the most realistically viable destination Kim Jong Un could probably travel when considering the travel time and flight distance.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two sides initially considered meeting in the Panmunjom truce village straddling the Korean military border, the scene of the third inter-Korea summit attended by Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month, the official said. The official said the South did not know the reason why Panmunjom was dropped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was no confirmation on the specific location for the meeting between Kim and Trump although there are a number of sites in Singapore that can guarantee security protection, including hotels that have experience hosting high-security events, Singapore media and a Singapore government official said.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the country was \"honoured to host it, and would do our best to facilitate a smooth and successful meeting,\" in a telephone call with Trump on Friday. Trump said the summit would contribute to resolving the long outstanding issue of securing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, Singapore's foreign ministry said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The meeting is scheduled for one day on June 12, but if either or both of the leaders decide to stay overnight, there is only one hotel room in all of the city that meets \u201csecurity protocol\" for the U.S. president, according to a source with knowledge of previous U.S. presidential visits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That is the 348-square meter Shangri-la Suite in the Valley Wing of the hotel of the same name, at a current rate of S$10,000 ($7,500) a night for June 12.

Americans will sweep for bugs in rooms at the Capello Hotel that could be used for side discussions, and could erect tents inside hotel meeting rooms to block any concealed cameras from viewing classified documents.Chinese intelligence agencies have shown the ability to penetrate mobile phones even when they are off, and U.S. officials are now told to take their batteries out when they are concerned about eavesdropping, according to a U.S. intelligence official.\"Chinese intelligence collection could be amped up around the summit,\" said Jeremy Bash, an NBC News analyst who was chief of staff to CIA Director Leon Panetta. \"They have prioritized surveillance in recent years and their technical prowess has really advanced.\"For years, the Chinese have engaged in a massive effort to recruit human spies in the West, and can call on an army of skilled hackers to gather intelligence from the web.But recently Chinese intelligence agencies have grown more creative and adept, U.S. officials say, posing an increasing threat to America's secrets.\"China remains a particularly aggressive espionage actor and is using increasingly sophisticated technological platforms to carry out its objectives,\" said Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the DNI's new counterintelligence agency.According to three U.S. officials, in one recent case a top U.S. official working in China repeatedly had trouble with his hotel key card. He had to replace it several times at the front desk because it wouldn't open his door.He brought one of the key cards back to the U.S., where security officials found a microphone embedded inside, according to the U.S. officials.The Chinese have placed listening and tracking devices in chips embedded in credit cards, key chains, jewelry, and even event credentials, the officials said, often with the intent of capturing secret conversations among American officials.In advance of Chinese President Xi Jinping's 2017 meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's south Florida estate, White House officials received detailed briefings on how the Chinese would try to spy on them during the visit \"in every possible way,\" said an official who was part of the visit.And U.S. officials \"swept all of our phones afterward\" to check if they were infiltrated by the Chinese, the official added.Seven months later when Trump traveled to Beijing, White House officials were given more extensive briefings, according to officials who were on the trip, in which they were told to assume the Chinese would be tracking, taping and watching them the entire time they were in the country.During the visit, the officials say the Chinese gave the U.S. delegation pins that the Americans called their friendship pins. But members of the delegation were not allowed to wear the pins into a secure area because security officials warned they likely had embedded listening devices.The officials said their belongings were rifled through while they were not in their hotel rooms, as happened to U.S. officials during previous presidential trips to China. Some senior members of Trump's delegation packed carry-on bags with anything they didn't want the Chinese to see and took the bags wherever they went, including out to dinner in restaurants, according to officials.\"All\u2019s fair in love, war and espionage.\"Even inside the U.S., the surveillance can be brazen. During a meeting between senior U.S. military officials and a Chinese military delegation several months ago at the Pentagon, one of the Chinese generals didn't hide his efforts to record the meeting, pointing his large watch in the direction of the Americans whenever they spoke, according to two officials familiar with details of the meeting.That story is among the anecdotes detailed in a recent internal report by the Defense Department and the intelligence community about the threat of surveillance inside the Pentagon.Defense Department spokesman Chris Sherwood declined to discuss the report, saying, \"We don't comment on intel nor on specific threat reports.\"According to Daniel Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, \"all's fair in love, war and espionage.\"Russel, who is now vice president at the Asia Society, added:, \"There's an awful lot that the Chinese do to us that we do, or try to do, to them. But as technology improves, the capabilities of the Chinese to collect become increasingly sophisticated.\"The real story is the incredible acceleration of technology, artificial intelligence, data gathering and monitoring.\"Cellphones can also be vulnerable. After President Barack Obama's first trip to China in 2009, one of his national security advisers had to throw away a Blackberry device because the Chinese had penetrated it, a former administration official said.Trump's reported use of non-secure cell phones in the White House is a massive security risk, experts say. Because smart phones can be turned into bugs and location tracking devices, Obama was not allowed to have one until 2016, and even then, he joked about how little functionality it had.It's been widely reported that Trump has rebuffed efforts by security officials to get him to use a secure mobile device, and he has been using standard-issue smart phones for Twitter and to place calls.The Washington Post reported this week that the Department of Homeland Security has found evidence of the use of sophisticated technology to intercept cell phone calls outside the White House, a type of technology that is available commercially and U.S. officials say Chinese and other foreign intelligence agencies regularly use.One former senior U.S. official said the Chinese have good intelligence collection operations in Singapore.\"What they would want to get is to know what people in the meetings said and what happened,\" the official said, and to get inside U.S. government officials' phones and computers.During other trips to China during the Obama administration, U.S. officials took increasingly strict steps to minimize any intelligence gathering from their meetings or devices. The Chinese would put microphones in U.S. officials' hotel rooms, credentials and the friendship pins featuring each country's flag, officials said.Officials were not allowed to bring those items into any meetings or secure area, instead leaving them outside those rooms, and always leaving them behind in China. U.S. officials also would leave any personal electronic devices on a government plane while in the country. The Chinese would similarly spy on reporters traveling with the president.U.S. government employees based in China are now told to presume their residences are wired for sound and video, and that the Chinese have recorded what they say or do at home, according to officials. Cabinet and other government officials are briefed on China's spying techniques, including the possibility that their hotel rooms could be wired.U.S. officials said the presumption on any visit to China or any interaction with Chinese officials outside the country is that Beijing would be trying to collect intelligence on the Americans or otherwise compromise them.Just this week, two U.S. intelligence officials appeared in court to face charges of spying for China, and a third suspected Chinese agent, former CIA officer Jerry Lee, faces trial next year.American officials fear the Chinese are making use of a massive trove of federal personal data they stole in 2015 to identify and target vulnerable intelligence officers, two U.S. officials told NBC News.\"China poses the most sophisticated counterintelligence threat to the U.S. of any other country right now,\" said Bash. \"And their intelligence gathering is probably at its highest peak in a long time.\""}{"head": "Trump offers US visit to Kim Jong-un if Singapore summit a success", "classes": ["submenu-tv-live-text", "submenu-tv-live-text"], "content": "Watch Euronews live streamWatch Euronews live streamTrump offers US visit to Kim Jong-un if Singapore summit a successPresident Donald Trump and Japan's Shinzo Abe say they are in lock step over sanctions against North Korea.Trump repeated meeting with Kim Jong-un would need results.\"I am totally prepared to walk.

A security perimeter will cover Sentosa Island as well as the shoreline of the mainland and will extend about 650 feet out to sea. Singapore\u2019s airspace will also be tightly restricted in the days surrounding the summit.Heightened security checks of people and vehicles will be in effect near the summit location and a wide range of items are banned, including drones and firearms as well as anything that could be used to make public statements or protests, such as aerosol paint cans, loudspeakers and any flag or banner larger than roughly three feet by three feet.\u00a0In Washington, the White House continues to prepare and the agenda for the meeting remains fluid.

Reuters reported that Kim may leave Singapore at 2 p.m. Tuesday, five hours after the start of the meeting with Trump. Trump had been scheduled to leave Singapore on Wednesday morning, but that departure was moved up to Tuesday night. The president is likely to take questions before heading back to the USA.Other topics that may surface at the summit\u00a0include negotiations for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, which technically still exists under a cease-fire reached in 1953.In making final preparations for the Kim summit,\u00a0Trump spoke by phone Monday with interested parties in the region,\u00a0South Korean President Moon Jae-in\u00a0and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\u00a0Abe\u00a0visited Trump at the White House last week.The South Korean government said in a statement that Moon offered his assessment of Kim and wished the U.S. president an early happy birthday. Trump turns 72 Thursday.A successful summit \"would be a big present for the world, as well as a good present for President Trump's birthday,\" the South Korean statement said.Trump and aides said they do not expect to sign a major denuclearization agreement at this summit.

The American president expressed confidence that Kim will take him up on this \"one-shot opportunity\" to help improve North Korea's standard of living.During the run-up to the summit, Trump said he would be able to determine quickly whether or not Kim is sincere when it comes to denuclearization.\"I think within the first minute I'll know,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0"}{"head": "Trump-Kim summit is theater that's worth playing out", "classes": ["video-desc", "speakable-p-1", "p-text", "speakable-p-2", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text-last"], "content": "\n    Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un's meeting face-to-face was historic and unprecedented. Here's a look at what we can expect in the coming months.\n    USA TODAYThe world has\u00a0certainly come a long way since last year, when North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (the \"little rocket man\")\u00a0threatened an atomic\u00a0attack on the United States, and President Trump (the \"dotard\")\u00a0responded by saying that his nuclear button was a lot bigger than Kim\u2019s.Their just-concluded summit in Singapore was great theater, and a welcome relief from all the warmongering. The imagery of a U.S. president standing side-by-side with a North Korean despot\u00a0was an astonishing sight that few would have predicted just months ago. The agreement signed by\u00a0Kim and Trump was historic and potentially groundbreaking.\u00a0The sense of hopefulness emerging from the summit, however, has to be leavened with a heavy dose of skepticism.Kim committed \"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d but\u00a0the details are murky and indefinite. So far, there is\u00a0no timetable and no plan for verifying\u00a0that the brutal regime is\u00a0unwinding its\u00a0cherished nuclear program.The world has\u00a0been down this road before. In 1994, for example,\u00a0Kim Jong Il, father of the current leader, agreed with President Clinton to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, the main producer of fissile material. That agreement lasted for all of two years.Will this one be any different? Hard to say.Perhaps most troubling about the Kim-Trump agreement is how much the United States has already given up. This includes the U.S. pledge to halt what Trump called \"provocative\" military exercises in the region\u00a0and, more significant, Trump\u2019s willingness to legitimize Kim on the world stage by appearing with him\u00a0and buttering up\u00a0the totalitarian ruler\u00a0as a \"very talented\" and trustworthy leader.\"He\u2019s a funny guy, he\u2019s very smart, he\u2019s a great negotiator. He loves his people,\u201d Trump told Voice of America contributor Greta Van Susteren\u00a0\u2014 words of flattery\u00a0that, if spoken by a Democratic president, would have Republicans howling.\u00a0The Singapore summit\u00a0came about largely because of Trump\u2019s eccentric and highly egocentric approach to foreign policy. Prior presidents started negotiations with North Korea at a relatively low level and allowed them to rise only as progress was made.\u00a0It's possible that Trump\u2019s top-down approach might prove more effective.But it is just as likely to be an impediment. Trump\u2019s agree-first, negotiate-later approach carried\u00a0an air of desperation. Having angered many of America\u2019s longtime allies and facing difficult midterm elections, Trump needed a diplomatic\u00a0victory. Kim, too, was looking to enhance his standing back home.One of the great ironies is that a successful Korea deal\u00a0\u2014 the dismantling of a nuclear program in return for economic security\u00a0\u2014 would look a lot like President Obama's Iran agreement, which Trump recently trashed.Whether the Singapore agreement\u00a0represents\u00a0sustainable progress toward reducing the risk of nuclear war,\u00a0or just more of the same, might not be known for months or even years. For now, it's\u00a0worth letting the process play out, as there remain no good military options on the Korean Peninsula.\u00a0USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Here's a look at what we can expect in the coming months.\n    USA TODAYLast fall, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were trading personal insults and threatening nuclear war. Fast-forward to the Singapore summit, and the two men are smiling and talking on the Island of Tranquility. Just like that, peace broke out.The two leaders signed a joint statement that marked the beginning of a process for North Korea\u2019s complete, verifiable\u00a0and irreversible denuclearization. Progress on other issues may follow, such as improvement in human rights and political reform, economic openness\u00a0and perhaps reunification with South Korea. We will see. But the two men have given birth to a new world of possibilities that\u00a0no thoughtful person can see as anything but good.Naturally, there has been no lack of criticism of the summit. But anti-Trump mania drives most of the critical narrative, rather than a reasoned analysis of strategic opportunity. The president was mocked for being overconfident, even as he approached the summit with repeated cautions that perhaps nothing would result.More: Donald Trump's off-the-cuff summit with Kim Jong Un might succeed. Here's why.More: Donald Trump should think again before North Korea summit in SingaporeHe was scoffed at for being an amateur in foreign policy, a reality TV star in over his head and ill-prepared. But as Dilbert creator Scott Adams pointed out, Trump has spent his entire 50-year career making deals, while young dictator Kim has never had to negotiate anything.We saw a preview of the power dynamic when the president walked away from the table two weeks ago and North Korea blinked.Now the supposed experts, pundits, former officials and other naysayers will have to eat their words. Trump the diplomatic novice \u2014 with an assist from eccentric former basketball great Dennis Rodman \u2014 is achieving what the cream of Ivy League-educated Washington swamp-dwellers could not.So is this just Big Mac diplomacy, trading a McDonald's on every corner for an end to Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions?Not at all. The Singapore summit was the product of the politics of power and interest. President Trump\u2019s most important diplomatic move came over a year ago when he explicitly linked the North Korean issue to trade negotiations with China, which no previous president had attempted. This was the key point of leverage, bringing Beijing to understand that it could not continue to support its North Korean ally without cost.Pyongyang\u2019s growing nuclear ballistic missile capabilities potentially threatened the U.S.\u00a0mainland and thus presented an unacceptable risk. Washington\u00a0asserted a credible threat of force against this threat. Beijing\u2019s choices were to pressure Kim to negotiate, or to suffer not only trade consequences but also the probability of direct U.S. military action against North Korea. It was an easy choice\u00a0for Beijing, which suspended iron, coal and lead imports from North Korea,\u00a0and cut off Pyongyang\u2019s access to Chinese banks.With his meager economic lifelines being cut, Kim had no other realistic choice but to meet with Trump. This alignment of interests was the art of the deal in action.More: Don't let Donald Trump erase Otto Warmbier from the Singapore summit with Kim Jong UnPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, mediaMaybe Kim understands the strategic disutility of nuclear weapons for developing nations\u00a0and wants to shift what little resources he has back to economic development. There is literally nowhere to go but up for his backward country. In return for ending its nuclear program North Korea will see an end to sanctions, be given access to international markets, and enjoy security guarantees from the United States.Kim may also agree to expose North Korea\u2019s illicit transnational nuclear and missile network, which includes Iran and Syria. That would be another counterproliferation coup for our \u201camateur diplomat\u201d president.In signing this agreement,\u00a0Kim has torn up the traditional Pyongyang playbook. Of course, we must recognize North Korea\u2019s track record of cheating on previous agreements. It is possible that this is all a ruse, but it is unlikely that Kim is pulling a fast one.He has too much to gain by sticking to the agreement\u00a0and everything to lose by breaking it. The emerging diplomatic process with North Korea will move forward because it is in everyone\u2019s interest for it to succeed. If this is \u201cseat of the pants negotiating,\u201d as Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says, maybe we need more of it.James S.

Many Singaporean Chinese who were suspected of acting against Japan\u00a0were also executed there.\u00a0The island was renamed\u00a0Sentosa \u2014\u00a0Malay for \"peace and tranquility\"\u00a0\u2014 in 1970, following a competition to come up with a new moniker. Its previous name was\u00a0Pulau Belakang Mati, meaning\u00a0\"Island After Death.\"The island earned the name because of its reputation as a rendezvous point for pirates during the 18th and 19th centuries. Sentosa is midway between China and India, so the island was an ideal trading port for the British. However,\u00a0pirates would take advantage of cargo\u00a0ships docked on its coast, making the area notoriously\u00a0dangerous, according to the BBC.White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders tweeted the location of the summit\u00a0 Tuesday. \"We thank our great Singaporean hosts for their hospitality,\" she added.Trump and Kim\u2019s summit is scheduled to start Tuesday at 9 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET Monday), after it was thrown into uncertainty when Trump abruptly canceled it, before negotiations put it back on track.A U.S. advance team was spotted at the Capella Hotel last week meeting with North Korean officials to prepare for the summit.Workers were putting a fresh coat of paint on the fa\u00e7ade Tuesday evening.

The Singapore Mint unveiled three commemorative coins, in gold, silver and nickel, featuring clasped hands under the North Korean and American flags on the front and the inscription \u201cWorld Peace\u201d on the reverse.Local businesses have been getting in on the act as well: Several restaurants spotted around town were offering summit-related promotions. The Royal Plaza on Scotts, a hotel near the Shangri-La where Trump is staying, \u00a0was selling a Trump-Kim burger featuring\u00a0kimchi, the spicy fermented dish that is a staple of Korean food.And the Trump and Kim impersonators who captured media attention at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February turned up in Singapore for an event where fans could take selfies with them for a price.Still, some locals took a bigger-picture perspective on Singapore\u2019s role in the historic summit.\u201cIt\u2019s very great to host such a big event,\u201d said D.M.

On Friday,\u00a0after meeting with the North's Vice Chairman\u00a0Kim Yong Chol, the president\u00a0appeared to tamp\u00a0down expectations for next week's meeting, calling it \"a get-to-know-you kind of a situation,\" and \"a process\" that starts with building relationships.Trump said the U.S. and North Korea may agree in Singapore to formally end the Korean War, which has been frozen with an armistice agreement since 1953. He said he no longer wants to speak of \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea, and\u00a0said\u00a0South Korea, Japan and China are expected to provide economic assistance to the North if the summit goes well.\u00a0He implied that U.S. sanctions\u00a0could\u00a0be lifted at a later point, which would allow\u00a0business relations between the North and the United States\u00a0for the first time.\u00a0But he is likely to hear from Kim that the North seeks more than a deal on nuclear weapons or a peace treaty.

The United States\u00a0offered to\u00a0arrange energy assistance from petroleum producers, build two light-water nuclear reactors that would be difficult to use\u00a0for producing\u00a0weapons, provide food assistance and lift sanctions.April's meeting of the rival Korean leaders ended with South Korean President Moon Jae-in's\u00a0promise\u00a0to connect and modernize railroad lines and roads.To keep that pledge, the South would need waivers from United Nations\u00a0Security Council sanctions on North Korea, something Trump appears ready to agree to provide to the South, China and Japan.\u00a0Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the United States\u00a0would not provide any benefits until the North completely dismantled its nuclear program.More: Donald Trump, North Korea's Kim Jong Un will likely save the details for after the summitMore: Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un: Still fighting the Korean WarMore: Kim Jong Un's fires top military leaders: What does it mean?North Korea has made agreements while still advancing\u00a0its nuclear program\u00a0and can be expected to continue doing\u00a0the same, said\u00a0Richard Fisher, a Korea and China analyst at\u00a0the\u00a0International Assessment and Strategy Center.While Kim negotiates\u00a0with Trump, his\u00a0engineers are probably\u00a0perfecting a weapon that can strike the U.S. mainland, Fisher said.\"They tested two\u00a0ICBMs\u00a0(intercontinental ballistic missiles) capable of reaching the United States,\" Fisher said. \"They have not yet demonstrated that the missile could\u00a0carry a warhead that would survive re-entry with some level of accuracy. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working day and night to develop a viable warhead.\"Kim's negotiations with Trump and Moon\u00a0\"allowed this megalomaniac leader to seem reasonable on the world stage,\" and furthers a shared North Korean and Chinese goal to\u00a0reduce U.S. influence in northeast Asia, Fisher said.\"Prior to these negotiations, Kim Jong Un was seen as a missile-rattling rocket boy threat to the world.

Here's a look at what we can expect in the coming months.\n    USA TODAYI supported President Trump\u2019s decision to meet with Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. From my own experience in negotiating with the North Koreans, I know that their leaders believe only they can make consequential decisions for their country. This makes sense since North Korea lacks a free press, an effective legislature\u00a0and any sense of \"we the people.\"\u00a0Although the United States is a democracy, President Trump has said that he feels that only he makes decisions for our country. I thought, then, that perhaps these two leaders might develop a framework that would authorize negotiating teams to move forward with a plan to dismantle North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program and ballistic missiles in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way.More: Don't let Donald Trump erase Otto Warmbier from the Singapore summit with Kim Jong UnMore: Donald Trump's off-the-cuff summit with Kim Jong Un might succeed. Here's why.Instead, the Singapore summit wasn\u2019t much more than bluster and balloons. It was a celebratory summit where Kim publicly received the respect and recognition he and his predecessors have long sought, and Trump didn\u2019t get much more than a vague promise. Optics were arranged to portray Kim as the equal of a U.S.\u00a0president. Flags of both countries were hung side-by-side, photo ops were arranged, and the leaders signed an official statement that was far weaker than at least three previous documents signed by North Korea in years past.Unlike the agreements negotiated in 1992, 1994\u00a0and 2005,\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s joint statement includes no verification requirements or framework to guide negotiations.To further complicate matters, President Trump announced that the United States would cease joint military exercises with South Korea and indicated that he hopes to withdraw all U.S. troops from the peninsula \u2014 removing from the start an important tool in our diplomatic toolbox, in this case deterrence of the North\u2019s large conventional military.To make matters worse, the president used North Korea\u2019s talking points, calling the exercises \"war games\"\u00a0and \"provocative\"\u00a0when they are defensive in nature. And, apparently, the announcement was made without South Korea\u2019s knowledge.This announcement underscores the president\u2019s predilection to act bilaterally and on his own without regard to alliances and partners. He appears to have forgotten about our unified command with the Republic of Korea, which serves our security as well as South Korea\u2019s, and he doesn\u2019t\u00a0seem to understand that any potential agreement would be durable only if South Korea, Japan, China\u00a0and Russia are on board.More: Donald Trump should think again before North Korea summit in SingaporePOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, mediaKim no doubt returned home to cheering crowds, organized by his government, heralding him as a great leader who successfully made the United States treat North Korea as an equal. President Trump, too, has turned on the media machine, organizing a political campaign-like rally to herald his summit. It would be better for everyone if these leaders and their teams simply got down to work.I hope the much-hyped personal touches of the summit lead\u00a0to a personal best in peacemaking for each leader and, more important, for our countries, our partners and the world.To get there, however, will take more than a vague summit statement. It will take hard work, a robust and capable team, technical detail, patience\u00a0and persistence. It will demand verification and monitoring. It will require the engagement of all our allies and partners \u2014 along with the U.S. Congress and the American people. The real celebration will be years down the road, if at all.Nonetheless, dialogue and diplomacy are certainly a better path than fire and fury.Wendy R.

denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and his plans to invite the North Korean leader to the White House.This live briefing has ended. See our main story on the North Korea summit here.President Trump, after a daylong historic summit with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un on Tuesday, announced plans to suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula and said he expected Mr. Kim to move \u201cvery quickly\u201d to dismantle his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.The summit meeting was the first of its kind between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader, and it ended in a joint statement that opened the door to ending seven decades of hostility between the two countries.Mr. Trump said at a news conference that the United States would stop \u201cthe war games,\u201d in what appeared to be a concession to the North. He said the exercises were expensive and \u201cvery provocative,\u201d though both the Pentagon and South Korean military were caught off guard by the announcement.In a joint statement after the leaders\u2019 first face-to-face meeting, the United States \u201ccommitted to provide security guarantees\u201d to the North. In exchange, Mr. Kim \u201creaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d But Mr. Trump said economic sanctions against North Korea would remain in place.Here\u2019s what happened:\u2022 The two leaders first met privately for less than an hour in a one-on-one session with interpreters present, before breaking off for a larger meeting and then a working lunch with aides.Advertisement\u2022 The leaders signed their joint statement, in which the United States committed to providing guarantees of security to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization.\u2022 \u201cWe had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,\u201d Mr. Kim said as he and Mr. Trump signed the joint statement, adding, \u201cThe world will see a major change.\u201dMr. Trump was similarly optimistic saying, \u201cWe are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world.\u201d\u2022 Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim departed Singapore hours after their meeting. See photos from the summit.In the joint statement, Mr. Trump \u201ccommitted to provide security guarantees\u201d to North Korea. Mr. Kim \u201creaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201dBut the statement was short on details and did not lay out potential next steps or a timetable. It was not immediately released to reporters, but was legible in a photo of Mr. Trump holding it up at the ceremony.The statement said the two nations would hold \u201cfollow-on negotiations\u201d led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a high-level North Korean official \u201cat the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes\u201d of the summit meeting.AdvertisementThe statement also said the two nations would \u201cjoin their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime\u201d on the divided Korean Peninsula, meaning talks to reduce military tensions that could eventually lead to a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War.During a meeting in Singapore, Donald Trump presented Kim Jong-un with a short video depicting the prosperity that could come with peace. James Poniewozik, The Times\u2019s chief television critic, tells us the video\u2019s cartoonish, idealized aesthetic was no accident.Mr. Trump presented Mr. Kim with a short video depicting the prosperity that could come with peace. The video, which was shown to journalists before Mr. Trump\u2019s news conference, was a hyperbolic movie-trailer-style montage of many, many images, both positive and dire.Among them: airplanes, bridges, skyscrapers, smiling children, American armaments, missile launches, postwar devastation, high-speed trains, a basketball player dunking a ball and horses running through water.\u201cThere comes a time when only a few are called upon to make a difference, but the question is: What difference will the few make?\u201d intones a narrator in the English-language version of the video.\u201cThe past doesn\u2019t have to be the future. Out of the darkness can come the light.\u201dAmerican and South Korean officials were surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to end \u201cwar games\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. Lt. Col. Jennifer Lovett, a United States military spokeswoman in South Korea, said in an email that the American command there \u201chas received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises \u2014 to include this fall\u2019s schedule Ulchi Freedom Guardian.\u201d\u201cWe will continue with our current military posture until we receive updated guidance from the Department of Defense,\u201d she added.Mr. Trump\u2019s statement that he was suspending joint military exercises with South Korea also stunned many South Koreans. The annual exercises have been an integral part of the alliance with the United States that forms the bulwark of South Korea\u2019s defenses against the North.Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncement raised fears that Washington was making concessions before North Korea had actually dismantled its nuclear weapons.AdvertisementThe South Korean Defense Ministry issued a curt statement saying that it was trying to determine Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions.Despite the uncertainty, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea celebrated the meeting\u2019s outcome, calling it \u201ca historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on earth.\u201d\u201cI pay my high compliments for the courage and determination of the two leaders, President Trump and Chairman Kim, not to settle for that outdated and familiar reality but to take a daring step toward change,\u201d Mr. Moon said.\u201cOnce again, I would like to pay my respects to President Trump, who achieved a feat that no one else has ever delivered,\u201d he said.At the end of their meeting, Mr. Kim pledged to destroy a missile-engine testing site, Mr. Trump told reporters, in what he characterized as a last-minute decision that was not included in the joint agreement.\u201cI got that after we signed the agreement,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the concession. \u201cI said, \u2018Do me a favor; we\u2019ve got this missile-engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you.\u201dThe death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was detained in North Korea, helped precipitate the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the president said on Tuesday at a post-summit meeting news conference.\u201cI think without Otto this would not have happened,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cOtto was someone who did not die in vain.\u201dAdvertisementMr. Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea in 2016. He was repatriated to the United States in a coma after 17 months in detention and then died.\u201cThe United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement at the time of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death.Mr. Trump, who was a developer before he became president, focused on one particular economic prospect for North Korea: real estate.\u201cAs an example, they have great beaches,\u201d he said during a news conference after his meeting with Mr. Kim. \u201cYou see that whenever they\u2019re exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, \u2018Boy, look at that view. Wouldn\u2019t that make a great condo?\u2019\u201d\u201cYou could have the best hotels in the world right there,\u201d Mr. Trump continued. \u201cThink of it from a real estate perspective. You have South Korea, you have China and they own the land in the middle. How bad is that, right? It\u2019s great.\u201dFor Americans who never got to bury loved ones killed in the Korean War, the summit meeting offered new hope.The joint statement signed by both leaders said their two countries were committed to recovering and repatriating the remains of soldiers who were designated captured or missing at the end of the conflict in 1953.Of the 82,000 American service members still missing from the wars of the past century, 7,702 are from the Korean War, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is responsible for recovering missing personnel from around the world.AdvertisementAn estimated 120,000 South Korean troops and police officers are also unaccounted for in the Korean War.Mr. Trump, in his post-meeting news conference, said he had received \u201ccountless calls and letters\u201d from family members asking him to discuss the issue with Mr. Kim.\u201cThe remains will be coming back,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to start that process immediately.\u201dChina welcomed the news from Singapore and patted itself on the back.\u201cI think nobody can doubt the extremely unique and important role China has played,\u201d said Wang Yi, the foreign minister.Mr. Wang may have been so pleased because of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.China floated that idea last year, suggesting that the North suspend its weapons program in exchange for an end to American military exercises.Chinese experts on North Korea, however, were underwhelmed by the summit meeting\u2019s outcome.\u201cWell below my expectation,\u201d Cheng Xiaohe of Renmin University said of the joint statement. \u201cFull of empty talk that has already been said before. So far Trump has failed to prove himself a dealmaker.\u201dFormer Vice President Joe Biden criticized the president\u2019s seemingly cozy relationship with North Korea and said the declaration signed by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was \u201cvery light on details\u201d in a statement hours after the meetingAdvertisement\u201cTalking to dictators is one thing; embracing them is another,\u201d Mr. Biden said. While Mr. Trump gained little from the meeting, the North Koreans had much to gain, he said.Mr. Biden urged the president to remember the \u201chorrendous human rights abuses North Korean leaders perpetrate against their own people\u201d and called Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that preparation for the meeting was unimportant \u201cinexcusable and irresponsible.\u201d\u201cNorth Korea gained the legitimacy of a meeting with the American president; the easing of the international economic and sanctions pressure, carefully built over the last two administrations; and the suspension of our military readiness exercises with South Korea \u2014 a decision apparently made without consulting our ally,\u201d Mr. Biden said in his statement.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim departed Singapore just hours after their meeting. Mr. Trump flew out ahead of schedule, leaving just before 6 p.m. local time on Tuesday. He had initially planned to leave early Wednesday, but said his plans had changed.\u201cThere was nothing more we could have done. We had the agreement done,\u201d Mr. Trump said when speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the flight, according to pool reports.\u201cI think he wants to get it done,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kim\u2019s willingness to denuclearize, adding that he trusted the North Korean leader.When asked how he planned to verify that North Korea would follow through on these promises, Mr. Trump provided little detail.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to check it, and we will check it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll check it very strongly.\u201dAdvertisementPresident Trump\u2019s plane touched down in Guam early Wednesday to refuel.Mr. Kim departed Singapore around 11 p.m. on an Air China flight, according to Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Communications and Information. The ministry shared photos of a smiling Mr. Kim shaking hands with Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore\u2019s minister of foreign affairs.Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim filed into a working lunch with their expanded entourages, and hamburgers were not on the menu.Mr. Trump, you may remember, famously said early in his campaign that he was willing to sit down with Mr. Kim and perhaps have a hamburger with him.Instead, their first meal together at the Capella on Sentosa Island in Singapore included beef short rib confit, Korean stuffed cucumber and sweet and sour crispy pork with Yangzhou fried rice. According to the menu released by the White House, dessert included a dark chocolate tartlet ganache \u2014 perhaps in honor of Mr. Trump\u2019s preference for chocolate cake. The White House did not indicate whether it had been flown over from Mar-a-Lago. When Mr. Trump played host to President Xi Jinping of China, he boasted about serving \u201cthe most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dIn deference to Mr. Kim, there was also another Korean dish, Daegu jorim, described as soy braised cod fish with radish and Asian vegetables.Reporting was contributed by Russell Goldman from Hong Kong, Mark Landler and Motoko Rich from Singapore, Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea, Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Michael Wolgelenter from London, Eric Schmitt from Washington, Megan Specia from New York and Jose A.

A potentially important event. The meaning of it is still to be seen. Apparently, the U.S. has agreed to suspension of exercises, which isn't as much of a giveaway as it seems. Asking for de-nuclearization while engaging in wargames at their border is a tough sell. Holding back on that this long was a good move. If N.K. shows ill will, it will be easier to resume military exercises. Sanctions remain. The test now is whether N.K. is serious. Trump has removed objections without compromising the main things. Now we must wait to see if Kim is not playing games. As much as legitimacy for the N. Korean gov't this action also brings them out of the shadows. Again, we will see if the N. Koreans are serious. If they aren't it will be on them, not us, not Trump. This could even work against China. Who knows? I'm willing to see what happens and not bash Trump in knee-jerk fashion. You can't make this up.  Key quotes - the remarks about the condo prospects. Always an angle, Donnie J.  Seriously?  When you think about it, that's his orientation to everything. Not surprising, really. He should just go live there and never come back.  It's 'his peeps' he is developing, lately - a real band of bro's - Donnie and the World Crime Mob with Zhynah, Pootin, and lil' Kim...  'World Toasted', their upcoming No. 1 hit...I suspect this will diminish America\u2019s clout in the region, and it\u2019s the second time in less than a week we sold out our allies. North Korea will likely pull out at the last minute, benefitting from easing sanctions while preserving nuclear capability (it wouldn\u2019t be the first time North Korea reneged).  Japan and South Korea will likely no longer depend on us for protection, and to hedge their bets, they may directly reach out to North Korea and China to make their own agreements.Trump should have prepared.With regard to selling out our allies, they were already selling us out. Trump merely retook the momentum. The concerns regarding S. Korean and Japanese security would be valid if the President had not worked to regain momentum. I wish folks would stop attacking everything about this President and not put me in the position of defending him. Attack the substance. Here we really don't know how things will play out. \u201cStick with me, Kim baby, and you\u2019ll be driving Cadillacs.\u201dIf Trump wasn\u2019t afflicted with those nasty bone spurs of his, he could have gone to Vietnam and made a 5-Star hotel out of the Hanoi Hilton and changed the course of history.  It can\u2019t get any easier than that.  Just like the kids game of Monopoly - not much thinking, roll the dice, hope you land on the right spot, buy more hotels till you get tired of winning.Sure, North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons.I've got a bridge that I'd like to sell to President Trump.Trump would have done better not to mention Otto Warmbier, who was detained, tortured and died at the hands of the North Koreans.  This bogus agreement is bad enough without reminding us of the cruelty and ruthlessness of the dictator he was playing pals with.It was a mighty fine show, The Kardashians could have not done much better. Well, maybe they could. This made for Fox News summit is as phony as everything else about Trump.\" The Presidential Apprentice: Dictator Summer \".  A VERY special episode.Trump made a \u201cpromise\u201d - Big deal!  Two dictators met.  Both liars. What\u2019s new?Sure sounds like an appeasement concession to Kim.Trump is a fascist.  I'm sure the CIA and FBI have had secret meeting in case this does not end well.  And it won't.....for anyone.Did the video included a pitch for Trump Hotel in Pyongyang, or a Trump resort in the mountains?I have a bad feeling about this episode of OUR DAILY REALITY SHOW.Maybe because the the 2 who signed this meaningless agreement are lying dirt bags with hidden agenda's, one is a brutal but clever Dictator and the other is a grifter conman who would sell his mother for a nickel.Extra, Extra, Trump sells out South Korea!! Read all about it. Another Republican Victory!Oh wait- this is a Trump deal. It may or may not be real. Only Kelly Conway knows. Trump has accomplished 4 significant things:1.  Demonstrate to the world that there is a payoff for developing the capability of hitting the United States with nuclear weapons, never mind if there is any possibility of actually using them without committing suicide.  The \"crisis\" thus created in the U.S. will lead to a shower of free goodies.  Iran is no doubt taking notes.2.  He has exchanged for a vague promise by NK to give up nuclear weapons which are militarily worthless because they are not usable for offensive strikes (as every nuclear power already knows) for giving NK for free a specific promise by the U.S. to eliminate its most important real military deterrent against it, namely maintaining battle-ready troops on the Korean peninsula.  The deterrent value of 30,000 U.S. troops in SK is much if they are not allowed to maintain combat readiness by performing joint exercises with SK troops.3.  He has brought Kim one important step closer to his overarching goal of dominating the Korean peninsula through conventional military means.4.  He has pleased China, which has long wanted American forces removed from the Korean peninsula, or the next best thing, rendered unprepared for combat.    Reasonable concerns are expressed here, but let's keep it all in perspective. The S. Koreans have long wanted to reunite with the North. President Moon is part of that school of thought. The S. Korean President was already working around the U.S. and undermining our efforts. There is no stomach in S. Korea's admin to take a hard line with Kim. Trump's action may help S. Koreans decide what they actually want. Trump may have done more to bring down the N. Korean gov't by engaging it. Kim has thrived in a hermit kingdom, but once in the real world he may find coping a lot harder. As far as nukes are concerned, Trump is obstructing nuclear proliferation--a laudable goal. Regarding China, if Korea is drawn closer to the U.S., then it will be that much further from China--a future competitor. The U.S. is unilaterally dropping South Korea\u2019s largest assurance of peace on the peninsula. Without warning. Do you want a nuclear armed South Korea? Because, Mr. Trump, this is how you get one. One con man meets another.Classic.Trump: unprepared in 2016, unprepared in 2018.What did 18 months of presidency teach Trump? Nothing. Bad teachers? No, bad student.If I was in Tokyo or Taipei, I would be seriously nervous.  Based on trumps actions toward our enemies vs our allies, it seems pretty clear that Russia, China, and NK coordinated this dog and pony show for maximum effect. Alienating friends and dropping military readiness in S Korea is something all three of our new best friends would welcome.So, what's Trump's NEXT move with the military going to be?   Training to invade Canada?  It's shocking that a president would just fling away such a vital aspect of our defense posture as military training exercises with our ally.  What kind of foreign policy is this?  Breaking up with long term democratic allies and going all kissy-kissy with despotic and murderous adversaries?  Don't cry for me, America!  For I've elected Trump as my Loathsome Leader. Trump totally ignored the issue of \"human rights\" in NK, which is and always has been an American value. Kim Jung Un assassinated his half brother and uncle. He has been recommended in a report by a UN commission in 2014  for crimes against humanity and was recommended for accountability for these crimes by the International Criminal Court. But Trump said he purposely didn\u2019t bring it up. But Trump closed Cuba to Americans due to \"human rights\" issues after Obama had opened it up in order to allow US business opportunities to compete with Russian influence. So now Russia is investing in Cuba and has a geopolitical advantage. The point is......\"human rights\" is really not important to Trump.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/world/americas/cuba-trump.htmlIn addition, Otto Warmbier's parents were on CNN today, recounting the horror of having their son returned to them as a deaf and blind vegetable. \"I think about Otto every day,\" his mother said, \"I think about Otto every minute of every day.\" The idea of Trump inviting his new pal to the White House is sickening. The only reason this meeting took place is because putin wanted it to.DJT works for putin not the American people, so it\u2019s easy to understand his disdain for the G7 but he meets with one communist dictator (Un)and proposes that another (putin) should be readmitted to the G7.His actions are treasonous and his very words are not close to believeable! DJT has no interest in the well being of this nation and its peopleI will support any and all candidates that seek his removal from office.Readers shared their thoughts on this article.The comments section is closed.

They are protecting against a literal info dump.\u201cThe leader\u2019s excretions contain information about his health status so they can\u2019t be left behind,\u201d Lee Yun-keol explained.Similar travel considerations are reportedly made whenever the North Korean leader conducts on-site inspections of military bases and state-run factories across the country.In fact, according to the South Korean news agency, Daily NK, there is a customised bathroom built into Kim\u2019s convoy of vehicles at all times.\u201cThe restrooms are not only in Kim Jong Un\u2019s personal train but whatever small or midsize cars he is traveling with and even in special vehicles that are designed for mountainous terrain or snow,\u201d a source in South Pyongan Provincefamiliar with Kim\u2019s Escort Command told\u00a0the DailyNK\u00a0in 2015. \u201cThere are multiple vehicles within the convoy so that people cannot tell which one he is in, and there is a separate car that acts as his restroom.\u201dSo, in this respect at least, it seems this historic summit is no different than Kim\u2019s other excursions.He simply always uses a personal, highly guarded toilet in \u201cloo\u201d of public facilities.\u00a0Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres...\u00a0Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that \u201cthe nation\u2019s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

Two days before the summit, he had a verbal brawl at the G7 Summit with some of America\u2019s closest allies; the trusting\u00a0 but miffed Germans, the\u00a0 exasperated French and traditional ally,\u00a0 Canada.An angry Trump refused to sign the G7 Communique and accused Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of stabbing America in the back. In turn, the\u00a0 countries accused America of insulting them.\u00a0 As the meeting with Jong-un\u00a0 got underway, the question was if brother Canada is beginning to find the Americans\u00a0 unreliable, is it the North Koreans who would trust them?Following\u00a0 his fight with trusted allies, Trump arrived Singapore, a man that appeared isolated.In\u00a0 contrast, Jong-un\u00a0 took strolls with Singaporean officials,\u00a0 appeared at ease and enjoying\u00a0 the international focus on him and his country. It was a sharp contrast; here is the leader\u00a0 of the \u2018Free World\u2019 looking isolated and the leader of\u00a0 North Korea, a country that has faced isolation for 68 years, appearing friendly, free and relaxed.For North Korea, the meeting was a good public relations and it had every reason to appear confident. Its food crises, is over, its possession of nuclear weapons, meant that Trump cannot\u00a0 afford to display the kind of arrogance he had exhibited to the Canadian and German leaders. Also, for the first time in nearly 70 years, the government in South Korea was not anti-North, wants peace and reconciliation and is keen to ensure that its territory will not be used as a theatre of war.The North and South Korea conflicts are a\u00a0 Cold War product. Both sides went to war on June 25, 1950. On the North Korean side were China and\u00a0 the defunct Soviet Union, on the South Korean side were\u00a0 21 countries including Great Britain with the US providing 90 per cent of the foreign troops under the United Nations flag.It was a stalemate, and by the time the ceasefire agreement was signed in July, 1953, over five million people had lost their lives. The US alone lost almost 40,000\u00a0 troops\u00a0 with over 100,000 injured. Technically, the war has\u00a0 not ended and it was only in April, 2018 that Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to sign a treaty formally ending the war, by the end of the year.It is clear that if the US has the capability and military strength, it would be dictating and not holding a meeting with Jong-un; but\u00a0 North Korea with its nuclear weapons has become like a needle which the rotund American cock, cannot swallow.The meeting itself was more of drama than substance. President Trump said his country is committed to providing\u00a0 security guarantees for North Korea, a promissory note which the North Koreans know is not cashable. In return,\u00a0 Jong-un \u201creaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The same commitment he had made to the South Korean President and to the world 46 days earlier.The twosome signed a vague four-point communique in which both sides committed themselves\u00a0 to establishing\u00a0 new\u00a0 relations for peace and prosperity. They also agreed to\u00a0 build \u201ca lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The third point was a reiteration of North Korea\u2019s commitment \u201cto work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The last,\u00a0 was\u00a0 a\u00a0 commitment to\u00a0 recovering the remains of Prisoners Of War\u00a0 and those Missing In Action and\u00a0 the immediate repatriation of those already identified.Both sides also\u00a0 agreed\u00a0 to hold follow-up negotiations, led by the American\u00a0 Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a high-level North Korean\u00a0 official. The timeframe for this is an equally vague \u201cearliest possible date\u201d to implement the outcomes of the\u00a0 summit.President Trump hailed the vague agreement as \u201ccomprehensive.\u201d While Jong-un returned home apparently satisfied that his country had exacted some commitments from the US and shown itself to the world that contrary to widely held beliefs, it is not a warmongering state,\u00a0 President Trump\u00a0 addressed a press conference seeking to provide some flesh to the bony agreement and provide some details.He said the US would stop its military exercises with South Korea because: \u201cWe will be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, it is very provocative.\u201dHe is also looking forward to bringing the 32,000 American troops home. Both promises, apart from being confidence-building measures, are also economically sensible.\u00a0 The rising annual cost of maintaining American troops in South Korea as at 2016, was $1.1 billion. Although the South Koreans pick up about half the bill, Trump has been complaining about it being a financial burden to cash strapped US. Additionally, the South Koreans spend $10 billion annually to provide support personnel services to the American military. It also makes huge arms purchases from the Americans which in the last 10 years came to over $32 billion. The South Koreans would rather want to spend such huge resources developing their country.America would certainly want to reduce the cost of maintaining foreign bases in countries like Germany, Japan, Qatar, Djibouti, Australia, Bahrain,\u00a0 Kenya, Colombia,\u00a0 and Bulgaria.The Trump promise of America gradually easing sanctions will be sweet to North Korean ears, but I am not sure how much store they can\u00a0 put in another Trump promise to assist in the massive\u00a0 development of\u00a0 their\u00a0 country, when America itself needs cash. As\u00a0 at May, 2018,\u00a0 the US official debt was $21.15 trillion\u00a0 while its former Comptroller-General\u00a0 (Director of American Government Accountability Office), Mr. David Walker says in reality, the American debt exceeds $65 trillion.While Trump appears anxious\u00a0 to negotiate a nuclear deal with North Korea, he is not hesitating in smashing\u00a0 the Iranian Nuclear deal with the United Nations because he knows\u00a0 the former has a stockpile of nuclear weapons while he believes the Iranians can be stopped from developing\u00a0 nuclear weapons.China should be happy about the easing of tension in the Korean Peninsula, stoppage of war games\u00a0\u00a0 and the possibility of America drastically reducing its troops there. But it should realise that the Americans may shift attention to the disputed South China Sea.If peace were to return, the immediate winners would be the two Koreas who will spend less on arms, work towards reconciliation and if possible, unite. But let me conclude by stating that the Talks are not irreversible especially if they are tailored primarily to achieve unilateral North Korean denuclearization. The North Koreans will not entrust their security and lives in the hands of the Americans.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres...\u00a0Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that \u201cthe nation\u2019s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

The diplomacy of disarmament is invariably risk-laden, complex and long.\u201cIt\u2019s too early,\u201d Asle Sveen, a historian who specialises in the Nobel prize, said of the prospects for a Kim-Trump award.\u201cBut if (the agreement) were to lead to real disarmament on the Korean peninsula, it would be very difficult to not award them the prize. It would be a bizarre situation, but that\u2019s happened in the past, that people with a pretty violent past have received the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d he said.Even before the Singapore summit, several people, including South Korean President Moon Jae-in, former US president Jimmy Carter and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, suggested Trump could deserve the Nobel.One fake Nobel Peace Prize nomination for Trump has already been invalidated after a case of identity fraud was uncovered earlier this year. But 18 Republicans have nominated him for 2019 in recognition of \u201chis tireless work to bring peace to our world.\u201dTen years after it awarded the Peace Prize to the newly-elected Barack Obama in a move that was widely mocked as being premature, the Nobel committee does not want to repeat past mistakes.And in 2000, the Nobel was awarded to then South Korean president Kim Dae-jung for his reconciliation efforts with the North, which turned out to be little more than \u201ca public relations campaign,\u201d said Henrik Urdal, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (Prio).\u201cI think they\u2019ll probably wait to see some pretty significant results before giving another prize in that direction,\u201d Urdal said.Dan Smith, the head of Stockholm peace research institute SIPRI, agreed the Nobel would be premature.\u201cToday\u2019s agreement is a good first step but the journey is long and complicated. Other things President Trump has done \u2014 most notably withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, which is crucial for global security, and destabilising the Iran nuclear deal, which is crucial for Middle East regional stability \u2014 are much less positive for peace.\u201d\u2013 \u2018Blood on their hands\u2019 \u2013\nIf real progress were to be made on the Korean peninsula, the Nobel committee would find itself in a bit of a dilemma, given the track record of the two main actors.\u201cMany of those who have received the Peace Prize have had quite a bit of blood on their hands,\u201d noted Urdal.\u201cThe question is whether they did enough good that it washes out the blood. Neither Trump nor Kim Jong Un have done enough this year to win the prize.\u201dGeir Lundestad, who served as the influential secretary of the Nobel committee between 1990 and 2014, used to say that the \u201cNobel is not a prize for saints.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to push this logic to the extreme either,\u201d he said on Tuesday.He hailed the Singapore summit but expressed scepticism about the possibility of a Nobel at this stage.\u201cThese two people have a lot of baggage: Kim is one of the worst dictators in the world and Donald Trump is in the process of tearing down the political and economic structures that the US set up after 1945 and that have benefitted everyone,\u201d he said.Urdal meanwhile pointed to the paradoxes in Trump\u2019s diplomacy.\u201cThe thing that damages Trump\u2019s chances the most is that he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal,\u201d Urdal said.\u201cAt the same that he\u2019s choosing the path of peace on the Korean peninsula, he\u2019s stoking a conflict in the Middle East and is putting an entire region in danger.\u201dPeter Wallensteen, a Swedish professor specialised in international relations, said South Korean President Moon Jae-in deserved to be included if ever a prize were awarded for peace in Korea.\u201cActually, Moon might be the one that deserves this the most, but that would be a slap against Trump!\u201dAFPAlso in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres...\u00a0Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that \u201cthe nation\u2019s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

We also see lots of evidence that suggests that many of the low skill jobs will be taken over by technology.\u201cNow, there\u2019s also tremendous hope for technology. I think there\u2019s tremendous hope that technology could help some African countries, many African countries we hope leapfrog and go forward and find new ways of driving economic growth.\u201cBut that there\u2019s no getting away from the need to invest much more and much more effectively in health and education. When we say rates of childhood stunting over 30 percent, meaning these children their brains are simply not as well-developed as their non-stunted peers, and that they were learn less and they will earn less in the future.\u201cWe have good date on that. That when stunting rates are over 30 percent, sometimes close to 50 percent that that group of young \u2014 of children will not be prepared to compete in the digital economy in the future. So human capital is a huge, huge issue.\u201cAnd I think, you know, if you look at all of the difficulties in terms of, you know, of increasing their resources for hard infrastructure, things like roads and energy, and also the need to increase investments in human capital. Every African country has to look much more seriously at how it improves its own domestic resource mobilization.\u201cSo in other words, they should be better at collecting taxes, you know, to just provide the basic services we think countries should collect at least 15 percent of GDP in taxes. Many countries don\u2019t reach that level.\u201cAlso, if African countries were to remove fossil fuel subsidies that are often very regressive, in other words, they help the rich more than they help the poor. Even agriculture subsidies, there are many agricultural subsidies that are also very regressive.\u201cThey don\u2019t help the small holder farmers, but they help others in the value chain.

They then moved into a roughly 40-minute one-on-one meeting, joined only by their interpreters, before including their advisers.For all the upbeat talk, it remained to be seen what, if any, concrete results the sit-down would produce.\"We are going to have a great discussion and I think tremendous success. We will be tremendously successful,\" Trump said before their private session.Kim said through an interpreter: \"It wasn't easy for us to come here. There was a past that grabbed our ankles and wrong prejudices and practices that at times covered our eyes and ears. We overcame all that and we are here now.\"Aware that the eyes of the world were on a moment that many people never expected to ever see, Kim remarked that many of those watching \"will think of this as a scene from a fantasy ... science fiction movie.\"In the run-up to the meeting, Trump had predicted the two men might strike a nuclear deal or forge a formal end to the Korean War in the course of a single meeting or over several days. But on the eve of the summit, the White House unexpectedly announced Trump would depart Singapore by Tuesday evening, raising questions about whether his aspirations for an ambitious outcome had been scaled back.The meeting was the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.Critics of the summit leapt at the handshake and the moonlight stroll Kim took Monday night along the glittering Singapore waterfront, saying it was further evidence that Trump was helping legitimize Kim on the world stage as an equal of the U.S. president. Kim has been accused of horrific rights abuses against his people. During his stroll, crowds yelled out Kim's name and jostled to take pictures, and the North Korean leader posed for a selfie with Singapore officials.Trump responded to that commentary on Tuesday on Twitter, saying: \"The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters & losers.\" But he added \"our hostages\" are back home and testing, research and launches have stopped.Trump also tweeted: \"Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly ... but in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!\"Addressing reporters on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to keep expectations in check, saying: \"We are hopeful this summit will have set the conditions for future successful talks.\"The summit capped a dizzying few days of foreign policy activity for Trump, who shocked U.S. allies over the weekend by using a meeting in Canada of the Group of Seven industrialized economies to alienate America's closest friends in the West. Lashing out over trade practices, Trump lobbed insults at his G-7 host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump left that summit early and, as he flew to Singapore, tweeted that he was yanking the U.S. out of the group's traditional closing statement.As for Singapore, the White House said Trump was leaving early because negotiations had moved \"more quickly than expected\" but gave no details. On the eve of the meeting, weeks of preparation appeared to pick up in pace, with U.S. and North Korean officials meeting throughout Monday at a Singapore hotel.The president planned to stop in Guam and Hawaii on the way back to Washington.Trump spoke only briefly in public on Monday, forecasting a \"nice\" outcome. Kim spent the day mostly out of view \u2014 until he embarked on the late-night sightseeing tour of Singapore, including the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, billed as the world's biggest glass greenhouse.Less than a year ago, Trump was threatening \"fire and fury\" against Kim, who in turn scorned the American president as a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\" As it happens, the North Korean and the American share a tendency to act unpredictably on the world stage.Beyond the impact on both leaders' political fortunes, the summit could shape the fate of countless people \u2014 the citizens of impoverished North Korea, the tens of millions living in the shadow of the North's nuclear threat, and millions more worldwide. Or, it could amount to little more than a much-photographed handshake.U.S. and North Korean officials huddled throughout Monday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, outlining specific goals for what the leaders should try to accomplish and multiple scenarios for resolving key issues, a senior U.S official said, adding that the meetings were also an ice breaker of sorts, allowing the teams to get better acquainted after decades of minimal contact between their nations.As Trump sought to build a bridge with Kim, he was smashing longtime alliances with Western allies with his abrasive performance at the G-7 and angry tweets directed at Trudeau and sent from aboard Air Force One as Trump flew from Quebec to Singapore.Trump advisers cast his actions as a show of strength before the Kim meeting.Alluding to the North's concerns that giving up its nuclear weapons could surrender its primary deterrent to forced regime change, Pompeo told reporters that the U.S. was prepared to take action to provide North Korea with \"sufficient certainty\" that denuclearization \"is not something that ends badly for them.\"He would not say whether that included the possibility of withdrawing U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, but said the context of the discussions was \"radically different than ever before.\"\"I can only say this,\" Pompeo said. \"We are prepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique, than America's been willing to provide previously.\"The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pompeo held firm to Trump's position that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes \u2014 and said they would even increase if diplomatic discussions did not progress positively.Experts believe the North is close to being able to target the entire U.S. mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep skepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the U.S. and the North.While advisers say Trump has been reviewing briefing materials, the president insists his gut instincts will matter most when he gets in the room with Kim. He told reporters he thinks he will know almost immediately whether a deal can be made, saying: \"I will know, just my touch, my feel. That's what I do.\"APRelated TagsHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Kim Jong Un arrives in Singapore for historic summit with Trump", "classes": [], "content": "Singapore - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un landed in Singapore on Sunday ahead of his historic summit with US President Donald Trump, local media reported.\u00a0Kim landed at Singapore Changi Airport at 2.38 pm (0638 GMT) on an Air China flight and was to be taken to the St Regis hotel, where his delegation is expected to stay, Channel NewsAsia reported.There was no footage of the leader's arrival.Trump was due to arrive several hours later from Quebec, where he attended the G7 summit with other world leaders.\u00a0The Trump-Kim summit, which will be held at the Capella Hotel on Tuesday morning, will mark the first time a North Korean leader has met with a sitting US president.\u00a0The talks will focus on reaching an agreement on the denuclearization of North Korea in exchange for the easing of economic and diplomatic sanctions.\u00a0As he departed on Saturday, Trump said he was on a \"mission of peace\" but also warned that the face-to-face talks were a \"one-time shot.\"\"I feel confident Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people,\" Trump said, adding that \"he won't have this opportunity again.\" He also insisted he would know within the \"first minute\" whether North Korea was serious about peace, using \"my touch, my feel\" to figure out the situation.

No, no, say others, you need to manage your expectations. This is just an elaborate get-to-know-you session, albeit between the two most famous leaders in the world, and nuclear armed at that.Actually, says another group, there will indeed be disarmament, a peace treaty ending the Korean War and North Korea's emergence as a contributing member of the international community - but just not right now.Whatever the results, it will be one of the more unusual summits in recent history as a flamboyant, often erratic U.S. president gets a close-up look at a hereditary socialist despot who sits on a nuclear weapons program.Here's a look at how Tuesday's first-ever meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the United States might turn out:WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE?Success in Singapore would see Kim making a bold decision to exchange his nukes for economic support and security assurances, according to Ryan Haas, an Asia expert at the John L. Thornton China Center. Both leaders would offer \"clear, specific, unequivocal statements\" outlining a dismantlement of North Korean weapons, an inventory and removal of all nuclear fuel and an opening up to U.N. nuclear inspectors.Trump has faced intense pressure to win something similar to this.A group of opposition Democratic lawmakers in the United States said in a statement that if Trump, a Republican, wants approval for a deal that allows an easing of sanctions on North Korea, he needs to get the permanent dismantlement and removal of \"every single one of North Korea's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,\" end all military nuclear fuel production and missile and nuclear tests, and persuade Pyongyang to \"commit to robust compliance inspections including a verification regime for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\"This is a very high bar and probably unrealistic after one meeting. Laboriously negotiated past nuclear deals, considered breakthroughs at the time, broke down on North Korea's extreme sensitivity to allowing in outsiders to look at whether they're dismantling their nuclear facilities, many of which are thought to be hidden.READ: Trump vs Kim insults: War of words between two leaders\"While a summit between Trump and Kim would be historic, it is unlikely to be decisive. This is not the fault of either Trump or Kim, but rather a reflection that intractable, decades-long strategic challenges rarely-if ever-get resolved in single encounters,\" Haas writes.SHOULD WE LOWER OUR EXPECTATIONS?Probably. In fact, Trump has been doing quite a bit of this lately.What was initially portrayed by the White House as a summit meant to completely rid the North of its nuclear weapons is now being cast as a chance to \"start a dialogue\" and for Trump the dealmaker to look into the eyes and take the measure of his nuclear-armed antagonist.Ferial Saeed, a former State Department official, writes that the summit will be a \"getting to know you meeting, 'plus.' That means, lower your expectations, and that the president is likely to lean toward keeping his own counsel and eschew a script. The 'plus' refers to discussions on ending the Korean War.\"China, both Koreas and the United States would have to sign off on any legally binding treaty, so it is unlikely Kim and Trump will do more than express an intention to end the war.Trump, after meeting recently with a North Korean envoy at the White House, said the summit will likely be part of \"a process.\"\"I told them today, take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly,\" Trump said.\"That is an extraordinary offer of flexibility, considering (North Korea) poses a direct security threat to the United States,\" according to Saeed.In part, these lowered expectations are a reflection of the extreme skepticism among many that the North can be persuaded to give up a nuclear program it has stubbornly built over the decades, often in secrecy and despite intense sanctions, international condemnation and widespread suffering among its people.\"There is no chance to make North Korean leaders ... surrender their nuclear weapons,\" Andrei Lankov, a Korea expert at Seoul's Kookmin University, wrote recently on a Washington-based Asia newsletter. \"They see denuclearization as a collective suicide (and they are probably right). However, now there are good chances to push North Korean nuclear/missile program back, for many years perhaps, and keep it that way for some time.\"WHAT IF THE SUMMIT FAILS?If things fall apart, it could be because \"Trump presents Kim with a hard-and-fast binary choice: relinquish nuclear weapons and live in peace and prosperity, or cling to them and risk the impoverishment of your people and the safety of your regime,\" Haas said.But a failure Tuesday doesn't necessarily mean a return to the animosity of 2017.That's in part because of South Korea's diplomatic outreach to the North, which was highlighted by two summits this spring between the rivals' leaders.If Trump and Kim fail in Singapore, \"the result may be to enhance North Korean dependency on Seoul and Beijing as safety valves against the prospect of renewal of U.S.-(North Korea) confrontation,\" according to Scott Snyder, a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.\u00a0\"This circumstance in and of itself provides a new buffer against the prospect of military escalation in Korea that was not present at the end of 2017.\"APHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

The world will see a major change.\u201dTrump said the process of denuclearisation would happen \"very, very quickly\", adding that he had formed a \"special bond\" with Kim and the relationship with North Korea would be very different.\u201cThis is going to lead to more and more and more,\u201d Trump said.Asked whether he would invite Kim to the White House, Trump said: \"Absolutely, I will.\"\u00a0He called Kim \"very smart\" and a \"very worthy, very hard negotiator.\"\"I learned he's a very talented man. I also learned that he loves his country very much.\"During a post-lunch stroll through the gardens of the Singapore hotel where the summit was held, Trump said the summit had gone \"better than anybody could have expected\".Kim stood silently alongside, but the North Korean leader had earlier described their meeting as a \"a good prelude to peace\".Both men walked to Trump's bullet-proof limousine, nicknamed \"The Beast\", and looked in at the rear seat, with Trump apparently showing Kim something inside. They then resumed their walk.Both men had appeared cautious and serious when they first arrived for the summit at the Capella hotel on Singapore's Sentosa, a resort island with luxury hotels, a casino, manmade beaches and a Universal Studios theme park.But, with cameras of the world's press trained on them, they displayed an initial atmosphere of bonhomie as they met on the verandah of the Capella, a refurbished 19th century British regimental officers' mess.After a handshake, they were soon smiling and holding each other by the arm, before Trump guided Kim to the library where they held a meeting with only their interpreters. Trump had said on Saturday he would know within a minute of meeting Kim whether he would reach a deal.Inside, they sat alongside each other against a backdrop of North Korean and U.S. flags, with Kim beaming broadly as the U.S. president gave him a thumbs up.The combatants of the 1950-53 Korean War are technically still at war, as the conflict, in which millions of people died, was concluded only with a truce.After initial exchanges lasting around 40 minutes, Trump and Kim emerged, walking side-by-side through the colonnaded hotel before entering a meeting room, where they were joined by their most senior officials.Kim was heard telling Trump through a translator: \"I think the entire world is watching this moment. Many people in the world will think of this as a scene from a fantasy...science fiction movie.\"Asked by a reporter how the meeting was going, Trump said: \"Very good. Very, very good. Good relationship.\"Kim also sounded positive about the prospects of peace.\"We overcame all kinds of scepticism and speculations about this summit and I believe that this is good for the peace,\" he said. \"I believe this is a good prelude for peace.\"The dollar jumped to a 3-week top on Tuesday and Asian shares rose on the news.Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and John Kelly, White House Chief of Staff, for the expanded talks, while Kim's team included former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and Ri Su Yong, vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party.As the two leaders met, Singapore navy vessels, and air force Apache helicopters patrolled, while fighter jets and an Gulfstream 550 early warning aircraft circled.Body language expert said both men tried to project command as they met, but also displayed signs of nerves.After the meetings, the two teams and other senior officials met for a working lunch, where beef short ribs, sweet and sour pork and \"Daegu Jormin\", or Korean braised cod, were served for the main course, according to the menu. That was to be followed by dark chocolate tarts, pastries and vanilla ice cream for dessert. The North Korean leader's sister and close confidante Kim Yo Jong was among the lunch party.As the cameras captured the moment, Trump quipped: \"Very nice. Getting a good picture everyone, so we all look nice and handsome and thin...perfect\".In the hours before the summit began, Trump expressed optimism about prospects for the first-ever meeting of sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders, while Pompeo injected a note of caution whether Kim would prove to be sincere about his willingness to denuclearise.Pompeo said the summit should set the framework for \"the hard work that will follow\", insisting that North Korea had to move toward complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.North Korea, however, has shown little appetite for surrendering nuclear weapons it considers vital to the survival of Kim's dynastic rule.Sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until that happened, Pompeo said on Monday. \"If diplomacy does not move in the right direction ... those measures will increase.\"The White House said later that discussions with North Korea had moved \"more quickly than expected\" and Trump would leave Singapore on Tuesday night after the summit, rather than Wednesday, as scheduled earlier.Kim is due to leave on Tuesday afternoon, a source involved in the planning of his visit has said.One of the world's most reclusive leaders, Kim visited Singapore's waterfront on Monday, smiling and waving to onlookers, adding to a more affable image that has emerged since his April summit with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in.Trump spoke to Moon and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, both key allies of Washington in the region, to discuss developments ahead of the summit.\"I too, got little sleep last night,\" Moon told his cabinet in Seoul as the summit began in Singapore.\"I truly hope it will be a successful summit that will open a new age for the two Koreas and the United States and bring us complete denuclearisation and peace.\"Related TagsHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Trump upbeat, Kim visits Singapore sites ahead of N.Korean summit", "classes": [], "content": "SINGAPORE - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday his historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore could \"work out very nicely\" as officials from both countries sought to narrow differences on how to end a nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula.Kim, one of the world's most reclusive leaders, made an evening tour of sites on Singapore's waterfront, on the eve of the summit that is due to get underway on Tuesday morning at a nearby resort island.While Trump was optimistic about prospects for the summit between the old foes, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo injected a note of caution ahead of the first-ever meeting of sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders, saying it remained to be seen whether Kim was sincere about his willingness to denuclearise.Officials from the two sides held last-minute talks aimed at laying the groundwork for a meeting that was almost unthinkable just months ago when the two leaders were exchanging insults and threats that raised fears of war.But after a flurry of diplomatic overtures eased tension in recent months, the two leaders are now headed for a history-making handshake that U.S. officials hope could eventually lead to the dismantling of a North Korean nuclear programme that threatens the United States.Offering a preview to reporters, Pompeo said it could provide \"an unprecedented opportunity to change the trajectory of our relationship and bring peace and prosperity\" to North Korea.However, he played down the possibility of a quick breakthrough and said the summit should set the framework for \"the hard work that will follow\", insisting that North Korea had to move toward complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.North Korea, though, has shown little appetite for surrendering nuclear weapons it considers vital to the survival of Kim's dynastic rule.Sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until that had happened, Pompeo said. \"If diplomacy does not move in the right direction ... those measures will increase.\"\"North Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearise and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere,\" he said.The White House later said discussions with North Korea had moved \"more quickly than expected\" and Trump would leave Singapore on Tuesday night, after the summit. He had earlier been scheduled to leave on Wednesday.Kim is due to leave on Tuesday afternoon, a source involved in the planning of his visit, said on Sunday.Kim was not believed to have left his hotel since a meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong soon after his arrival in the city on Sunday, but he ventured out on Monday evening.The Swiss-educated leader, who is believed to be 34, has not left his isolated country since taking office in 2011 other than to visit China and the South Korean side of the border Demilitarised Zone, which separates the two Koreas.His first stop was a waterfront park with futuristic installations, Gardens by the Bay, which boasts the largest glass greenhouse and tallest indoor waterfall in the world.He joined Singapore's foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, who took a selfie, before stopping at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which resembles a giant surfboard perched on three tall columns, for a look out over the bright lights of the city from its rooftop garden and swimming pool.On the way back to his hotel, Kim walked along a promenade near the Merlion, a giant statue, and fountain, of a mythical creature, half lion, half fish - Singapore's unofficial mascot.The rare public appearance of Kim, waving and smiling to onlookers, adds to the more affable image of the young leader that has emerged since his summit in April with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in.Just a few months ago, Kim was an international pariah accused of ordering the killing of his uncle, a half-brother and scores of officials suspected of disloyalty.'INTERESTING MEETING'Trump arrived in Singapore on Sunday after a blow-up over trade with other members of the Group of Seven major industrialised nations that cast a cloud over his efforts to score a major foreign policy win in the nuclear talks.Although gaps remain over what denuclearisation would entail, Trump sounded a positive note in a lunch meeting with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee.\"We've got a very interesting meeting ... tomorrow, and I just think it's going to work out very nicely,\" Trump said.It was a far cry from last year when Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" and mocked Kim as \"little rocket man,\" and Kim denounced the U.S. president as the \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\"Trump and Kim are staying in separate hotels less that a kilometre apart in the famous Orchard Road area of Singapore, dotted with high-rise luxury apartment blocks, offices and glittering shopping malls.Commenting for the first time on the summit, North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said the two sides would exchange \"wide-ranging and profound views\" to re-set relations. It heralded the summit as part of a \"changed era\".Discussions would focus on \"the issue of building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula, the issue of realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern\", KCNA said.In the lead up to the summit, North Korea rejected any unilateral nuclear disarmament, and KCNA's reference to denuclearisation of the peninsula has historically meant it wants the United States to remove its \"nuclear umbrella\" protecting South Korea and Japan.RISKThe White House said Trump would hold a one-on-one meeting with Kim on Tuesday on the small island of Sentosa. The two will later be joined by officials and have lunch together.Many experts on North Korea, one of the most insular and unpredictable countries in the world, remain sceptical Kim will ever completely abandon nuclear weapons. They believe Kim's engagement is aimed at getting the United States to ease the crippling sanctions that have squeezed the impoverished country.Kelsey Davenport, director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, said there were signs that the gaps between the two sides were narrowing but there was also risk.\"Trump is likely to declare the summit a victory irrespective of the outcome, but if the two sides fail to reach a common understanding of denuclearisation it will put at risk any process that the summit kicks off,\" he said.\"The process could be doomed before it begins.\"Trump initially touted the potential for a grand bargain with North Korea to rid itself of a nuclear missile programme that has advanced rapidly to threaten the United States.But he has since lowered expectations, backing away from an original demand for North Korea's swift denuclearisation.He has said the talks would be more about starting a relationship with Kim for a negotiating process that would take more than one summit.

The summit is a meeting of two strongmen of 21st century politics.Trump and Kim will meet in front of the world\u2019s media at around 9am local time. Any progress will have to be swift - the North Korean delegation is reportedly scheduled to leave Singapore as early as five hours later.Trump has previously said that nothing short of a commitment to total denuclearisation by the reclusive state will be good enough. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, said Kim travelled to Singapore with the intention of meeting the US leader and \u201cmeet the changing demands of the new era\u201d.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, on the other hand, has expressed hope the summit will lead to a declaration to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. But a spokesperson said it\u2019s unlikely that such a declaration would take place while Trump and Kim were still in Singapore. Trump has raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.Whatever the outcome of today\u2019s summit, it is unquestionable that the world - and especially the Korean peninsula - will be a safer place if Kim curtails his nuclear ambitions and Trump stops his sabre-rattling.Still, it remains to be seen whether the Singapore summit will achieve anything in itself. Even if it doesn\u2019t, it is not the end of the process, but merely a significant historic moment at its beginning. The chance to agree to a process of denuclearisation with Pyongyang is in itself a remarkable breakthrough.The MercuryHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "N.Korean official lands in Singapore as summit preparations advance", "classes": [], "content": "TOKYO/SEOUL - A top aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday night, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Tuesday, the latest indication that the on-again-off-again summit with U.S. President Donald Trump may go ahead.Kim Chang Son, Kim's de facto chief of staff, flew to Singapore via Beijing on Monday night, the report said.At the same time, a team of U.S. government officials, including the White House deputy chief of staff for operations Joe Hagin, left U.S. Yokota Air Base in Japan for Singapore on Monday, NHK said.The White House said a \"pre-advance\" team was traveling to Singapore to meet with North Koreans.The reports indicate that planning for the historic summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead after Trump called it off last week. A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details.When Kim Chang Son was asked by a reporter at the Beijing airport if he was flying to Singapore for talks with the United States, he said he was \"going there to play,\" according to footage from Nippon Television Network.Meanwhile, North Korea's Kim Yong Chol, a senior official dealing with inter-Korean affairs was scheduled to fly to the United States on Wednesday after speaking to Chinese officials in Beijing, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said citing an unnamed source.Due to sanctions against him, Kim Yong Chol is banned from visiting the United States normally. His visit to the United States would indicate a waiver was granted.The United States and South Korea blacklisted Kim Yong Chol for supporting the North's nuclear and missile programmes in 2010 and 2016, respectively.Yonhap added Choe Kang Il, a North Korean foreign ministry official involved with North America issues, was also spotted at Beijing Capital International Airport. Yonhap did not say whether Choe would be accompanying Kim Yong Chol.In a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend, Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a surprise meeting on Saturday at the border village of Panmunjom, during which they agreed the North Korea-U.S. summit must be held.And on Sunday, the U.S. State Department said American and North Korean officials had met at Panmunjom. Sung Kim, the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and current ambassador to the Philippines, led that American delegation, an American official told Reuters.Moon said on Monday that there could be more impromptu talks between the two Koreas in the lead-up to the summit.In Kim and Moon's first, upbeat meeting on April 27, they agreed to seek the \"complete denuclearisation\" of the Korean peninsula - but didn't define what that meant, or how that would proceed.Since then, North Korea has rejected U.S. demands for it to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons programme that experts say could threaten the United States.Pyongyang also demanded the United States halt future joint military drills with South Korea if it truly wishes for talks with North Korea, the North's Rodong Sinmun said on Tuesday.\u00a0In response to reporters' questions regarding the report, South Korea's defense ministry said it does not have plans to change joint exercise schedules with the United States military.Analysts believe Washington is trying to determine whether North Korea is willing to agree on sufficient steps towards denuclearisation to allow a summit to take place.North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programmes as a deterrent against perceived aggression by the United States, which keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.It has long said it is open to eventually giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and ends its \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d alliance with Seoul.Heated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Trump may still meet North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un", "classes": [], "content": "US President Donald Trump said a planned summit with North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un could still take place on June 12 as scheduled, although just days ago he cancelled the meeting citing Pyongyang\u2019s \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility\u201d.

Trump is expected to hold talks with Lee on Monday.On the US side, joining Trump was a delegation of high-level officials,\u00a0 including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton.Before boarding the Air Force One flight to Singapore, Trump said: \u201cAt a minimum, I do believe we will have met each other.\u201d\u201cWe will have seen each other.\nHopefully we will have liked each other and we\u2019ll start that process. I would say that would be the minimal.\u201dThe summit comes after months of speculation and disputes between Washington and Pyongyang that led Trump to briefly cancel the June 12 meeting on May 24.READ MORE: North Korea threatens to cancel US summitAfter a flurry of diplomatic efforts, including a White House meeting between by Kim\u2019s right-hand man Kim Yong-chol and Trump, the proposed summit was put back on.Al Jazeera\u2019s James Bays, reporting from Singapore, said Trump has been sending \u201cmixed messages\u201d to Kim ahead of their meeting.\u201cPresident Trump last month briefly called off this summit and he has repeatedly threatened to walk out if he doesn\u2019t believe the negotiations are serious. That\u2019s a tough position.\u201dAuthorities in Singapore imposed tight security around the summit venue and related luxury hotels, including installing extra pot plants outside one contender for Kim\u2019s accommodation to obstruct reporters\u2019 views.At stake at the summit are North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and peace on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea spent decades developing nuclear weapons, culminating in the test of a thermonuclear device in 2017. It also successfully tested missiles that had enough range to reach the US mainland.The tests came amid a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure,\u201d led by Washington, that tightened economic sanctions against Pyongyang and raised the possibility of military action.In a New Year\u2019s address, Kim said his country had completed development of its nuclear programme and would focus on economic development, suggesting a meeting with South Korea.After a flurry of contacts between the two Koreas , South Korean officials suggested to Trump in March that Kim would be willing to meet face-to-face.The talks will focus on reaching an agreement on the denuclearisation of North Korea in exchange for the easing of economic and diplomatic sanctions.Victor Teo, professor at the University of Hong Kong, believes \u201cNorth Koreans are upbeat, but careful at the same time\u201d.He told Al Jazeera: \u201cA meeting where the optics are positive, meaning Trump gets a handshake with Kim Jong-un and they both go home agreeing to some kind of denuclearisation deal would go a long way domestically for President Trump as much as it would for the chairman of the state committee.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Al JazeeraGet the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)Plans for a landmark summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un are moving \u201cvery nicely\u201d, US President Donald Trump said Sunday, as the South\u2019s leader said Kim told him the talks would be a historic opportunity to end decades of confrontation.The latest conciliatory declarations capped a turbulent few days of diplomatic brinkmanship on the Korean Peninsula that had sent tensions soaring.Trump rattled the region on Thursday by cancelling a planned June 12 meeting with Kim in Singapore, citing \u201copen hostility\u201d from Pyongyang.But within 24 hours he reversed course, saying it could still go ahead after productive talks were held with North Korean officials.\u201cIt\u2019s moving along very nicely,\u201d Trump told reporters late Saturday when asked for an update. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at June 12 in Singapore.\nThat hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dTrump\u2019s unpredictability sparked a sudden and surprise meeting on Saturday between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in \u2014 only the fourth time leaders from the two countries have ever met \u2014 as they scrambled to get the talks back on track.Pictures showed them shaking hands and embracing on the North Korean side of the Demilitarised Zone separating the two nations.Moon said Kim reached out to him to arrange the hasty meeting \u201cwithout any formality\u201d. There the North Korean leader described the Singapore summit as a landmark opportunity to end decades of confrontation.\u201cHe\u2026 expressed his intention to put an end to the history of war and confrontation through the success of the North-US summit and to cooperate for peace and prosperity,\u201d Moon told reporters in Seoul on Sunday.Pyongyang\u2019s state-run KCNA news agency said Kim \u201cexpressed his fixed will on the historic DPRK-US summit talks\u201d, using the official abbreviation for North Korea.Kim said the two Koreas should \u201cpositively cooperate with each other as ever to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations and establish mechanism for permanent and durable peace,\u201d KCNA added, saying South and North Korea would hold another round of \u201chigh-level\u201d talks on June 1.Trump\u2019s original decision to abandon the historic summit initially blindsided South Korea, which had been brokering a remarkable detente between Washington and Pyongyang and is desperate to avoid conflict breaking out.However, there was a further signal of progress Saturday as White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed a team of US officials was leaving for Singapore \u201cin order to prepare should the summit take place\u201d.Last year, Trump and Kim were trading war threats and insults after Pyongyang tested its most powerful nuclear weapon to date and missiles it said were capable of reaching the US mainland.Tensions were calmed after Kim extended an olive branch by offering to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, sparking a rapid detente that led to Trump agreeing to hold direct talks with Pyongyang.Moon won the election last year partly by vowing to be open to dialogue with the North and finding a solution to a Cold War-era sore that continues to blight the region.The flurry of diplomatic backslapping and bonhomie disappeared in recent weeks as the summit was thrown into doubt by increasingly bellicose rhetoric from both top US administration officials and Pyongyang.There are still stark differences between what the two sides hope to achieve.Washington wants North Korea to give up all its nukes in a verifiable way as quickly as possible in return for sanctions and economic relief.Pyongyang has a different view of what denuclearisation might look like and remains deeply worried that abandoning that deterrent would leave the country vulnerable to regime change.\u201cKim stressed again that he had a firm determination towards complete denuclearisation,\u201d Moon told reporters Sunday.\u201cThe thing he was uncertain about was not denuclearisation but concerns on whether he could trust that the US would end its hostile policy and guarantee the security of his regime when the North denuclearises itself.\u201dSaturday\u2019s meeting between Moon and Kim took place on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, a heavily fortified village that lies between the two countries where the 1953 armistice was signed.Only last month, the two leaders met in the same village, with Kim famously inviting Moon to step briefly into the North before they both held talks in a building on the South\u2019s side.Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korea studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said Moon and Kim moved quickly to defuse the crisis after Trump\u2019s shock cancellation.\u201cMoon essentially helped relay messages from Trump to Kim and vice versa, to further smooth the process and to resume negotiations,\u201d he told AFP, saying the Singapore meeting was \u201cclearly back on track\u201d.Unlike last month\u2019s summit, which was held in front of live TV cameras, Saturday\u2019s meeting took place in utmost secrecy, with reporters only told later that the face-to-face had taken place.Footage released by the Blue House on Twitter, accompanied by a dramatic orchestral score, showed Moon arriving in a convoy of cars and first shaking hands with Kim\u2019s sister Kim Yo Jong, who has played a major public role in recent talks with the South.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(Reuters)Donald Trump dangled the carrot of foreign investment in front of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at their nuclear summit, but analysts say few will want to put money into one of the highest-risk business environments in the world.The US president showed Kim a movie of bright lights, high-speed trains and soaring tower blocks \u2014 pitching a future that could be possible if Pyongyang gives up its weapons.Optimists say that with mineral wealth, cheap labour, and a helpful geographical location, the North has huge potential.But the history of overseas firms who have tried to set up operations in the isolated, impoverished country is a long and sorry one.Rules that can change on a whim, bills that are never paid, and the threat of expropriation hang over foreigners who step into the wildest of wild east investment destinations.For now, dozens of restrictions apply under the various sanctions regimes imposed on the North over its nuclear ambitions.Joint ventures are banned by the UN Security Council, the European Union blocks financial transfers of more than \u20ac5 000, and US regulations mean international banks are loath to enable transactions of any kind \u2013- so much so that even humanitarian organisations struggle to fund their activities.READ MORE: History and handshakes \u2014 Five key takeaways from the Korea summitAnd even if they are lifted, there are major challenges to working in the North.Infrastructure is poor, and analysts say corruption is widespread.Crucially, said a diplomatic source in Pyongyang, \u201clegal guarantees for business are very weak\u201d.During the Sunshine Policy, a previous period of warmer ties, South Korean conglomerate Hyundai poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a tourist resort for Southerners to visit the scenic Mount Kumgang.But the trips came to an abrupt halt when a North Korean soldier shot dead a woman from the South who strayed into a forbidden zone.Many South Korean firms set up operations in the joint-venture Kaesong Industrial Complex where they employed cheap labour from the North, but Seoul closed the project in 2016 over Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programmes.Egyptian telecom firm Orascom poured hundreds of millions of dollars into setting up the North\u2019s first mobile phone network, Koryolink, only for the government to set up a rival operator of its own.The company was also unable to get its money out.\u201cI am taking all the hits,\u201d Orascom\u2019s billionaire owner Naguib Sawiris told Bloomberg last month. \u201cI am being paid in a currency that doesn\u2019t get exchanged very easily, I have put a lot of money and built a hotel and did a lot of good stuff there.\u201dConstruction giant LafargeHolcim last year disposed of its stake in a North Korean cement plant for an undisclosed sum, nursing significant losses.\u201cGovernance is weak, information is lacking and there are huge cultural gaps with local partners,\u201d said Geoffrey See, founder of Choson Exchange, a non-profit that trains entrepreneurs and economic policymakers in the North.The most successful foreign firms in the North, he added, focus on trading activities to avoid having assets in the country that are vulnerable to seizure.Kim undoubtedly wants to make his country better off.\nHe declared earlier this year that having completed the development of his nuclear arsenal, \u201csocialist economic construction\u201d was now his top priority.State media\u2019s coverage of the Singapore summit included extensive pictures of the prosperous city-state, a port, and even Kim\u2019s motorcade passing a Cartier advert \u2014 images that would not have been shown in the past.It was an indication of \u201cpermissible aspiration\u201d, said an Asia-based diplomat.The highly secretive North has been quietly bringing in reforms for several years, allowing private traders to operate in informal markets, giving state-owned enterprises some freedoms to operate, and turning a blind eye to private company operations.The moves are reminiscent of China\u2019s \u201creform and opening\u201d under Deng Xiaoping, which propelled the country from a basketcase to the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Foreign firms have also begun to make inquiries since Pyongyang\u2019s recent diplomatic thaw, says Michael Spavor of Paektu Consulting, who has been working with the country for 20 years.\u201cOur organisation has had much interest recently from investors interested in market research as well as face-to-face matchmaking with potential DPRK ministries and future partners,\u201d he told AFP, using the official acronym for North Korea.But the North has not officially embraced the market. At the last ruling party congress, Kim decried the \u201cfilthy wind of bourgeois liberty and \u2018reform\u2019 and \u2018openness\u2019 blowing in our neighbourhood\u201d.China has taken North Korean officials on study tours of Beijing, Shanghai and its coal-rich provinces to try to encourage them to follow its example, and diplomats say it is offering detailed development planning.But they add that Pyongyang is wary of being too dependent on Beijing, and prefers to look to Vietnam for an example of how a smaller Communist country has been able to adopt capitalism while not weakening the authorities\u2019 hold on power.READ MORE: Big Brother capitalism for North KoreaNorth Korea does have some advantages, says Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist for Capital Economics, pointing out natural resources including zinc, magnesite, iron and copper, low-cost labour, and an advantageous location.But even if sanctions are lifted, he said, \u201cit\u2019s basically a police state and you have a long way to go to North Korea becoming a normal economy\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a very brave investor to venture in again.\u201d\u00a9 Agence France-PresseGet the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

But so far the North has not given any public indication of what concessions it is offering, beyond euphemistic commitments to denuclearisation of the \u201cKorean peninsula\u201d. Pyongyang had \u201cmade clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearisation is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States\u201d, minister Kim said. In the past, Pyongyang has demanded the withdrawal of the US troops stationed in the South to protect it from its neighbour, and an end to Washington\u2019s nuclear umbrella over its security ally. The minister also blasted US National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s talk of a \u201cLibyan model\u201d for North Korean denuclearisation. It was a \u201csinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq\u201d, he said.\n\u201cI cannot suppress indignation at such moves of the US, and harbour doubt about the US sincerity.\u201d The North has long said it needs nuclear weapons to protect itself against a US invasion. After giving up his atomic programme, Libyan leader Moamer Khadafi was killed in an uprising backed by NATO bombing. Minister Kim also dismissed offers by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 who has visited Pyongyang twice in recent weeks, coming back the second time with three released US detainees \u2014 for US economic aid if the North denuclearises. \u201cWe have never had any expectation of US support in carrying out our economic construction and will not at all make such a deal in future,\u201d Kim said. In recent weeks, as well as an eye-catching summit with the South\u2019s leader last month in the Demilitarized Zone, Kim has twice met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pyongyang has announced it will destroy its nuclear testing site next week. Analysts said Pyongyang was now trying to redefine the terms of the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a diplomatic tactic,\u201d Kim Hyun-wook, professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told AFP, calling it \u201cbrinkmanship to change the US position\u201d. \u201cIt looks like Kim Jong Un was pushed into accepting US demands for \u2018denuclearisation-first\u2019 but is now trying to change its position after normalising North Korea-China relations and securing economic assistance,\u201d he added. \u201cThe classic North Korean tightrope diplomacy between the US and China has begun.\u201d US officials have repeatedly claimed credit for Washington\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy for bringing Pyongyang to the negotiating table. Joshua Pollack of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies said Pyongyang had been irritated by the \u201ctriumphalist tone\u201d. \u201cThe North Koreans aren\u2019t happy with what they\u2019re seeing and hearing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is still a yawning gulf between expectations for diplomacy in Pyongyang and Washington, DC.\u201d Earlier KCNA denounced the Max Thunder joint military exercises being held between the US and South Korea as a \u201crude and wicked provocation\u201d, and Seoul said it had received a message cancelling planned high-level talks \u201cindefinitely\u201d. The two-week drills started last Friday and involves some 100 aircraft from the two allies, including F-22 stealth fighter jets. Pyongyang\u2019s move was \u201cregrettable\u201d, said unification ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun, adding it \u201ccontradicts the fundamental spirit and purpose of the Panmunjom Declaration\u201d. Hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War stopped with a ceasefire, leaving the two halves of the peninsula divided by the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and still technically at war. The North has spent decades developing its atomic arsenal and missiles capable of reaching the US, earning itself multiple rounds of UN Security Council resolutions, while Trump and Kim traded personal insults and threats of war last year. Relations underwent a sudden turnaround as Moon used February\u2019s Winter Olympics in the South to broker talks between Washington and Pyongyang. Washington said it will continue to plan the meeting in Singapore on June 12, with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert telling reporters it had received \u201cno notification\u201d of a position change by North Korea. The exercises were \u201cnot provocative\u201d and would continue, she added.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

According to custom, the khukri must draw blood every time it is unsheathed.\u201cThey are among the best Singapore can offer, and I am sure they will be involved (in the summit),\u201d said Tim Huxley, an expert on Singapore\u2019s armed forces at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).\u201cThey remain very much a substantial and front line force, and the demands of this kind of event are precisely the sort of special operation that the Gurkhas are trained to handle,\u201d he said.A spokesman for the Singapore police declined to comment on the deployment of the Gurkhas or their numbers.The IISS Military Balance says 1,800 Gurkhas serve in the Singapore police, across six paramilitary companies.A legacy in part of the British colonial era and more recent pragmatic Singaporean leadership, Singapore\u2019s Gurkhas are linked to a British tradition that has recruited and paid for elite regiments of soldiers from Nepal for more than 200 years.Beaten back by the Gurkhas in the 19th century Anglo-Nepalese War and admired for their valour and fighting skills, the colonial British then began to recruit them. Now Gurkhas serve in the British, Indian and Nepalese armies, as well as in Brunei and Singapore.They have fought in both world wars as well as the Falklands conflict and, more recently, in Afghanistan.\u2018Tough, vigilant and steadfast\u2019Huxley said the Gurkhas had long proven to be an asset to Singapore\u2019s leadership, providing a neutral force within an ethnically diverse city-state, including VIP and anti-riot protection.At times of regional tension, they have protected international schools, and are often seen at the Malaysia-Singapore border crossings.The Singapore Police website describes the group as \u201ctough, vigilant and steadfast\u201d that operates \u201cacross the spectrum of paramilitary operations to help safeguard Singapore\u201d.They live with their families in the secure Mount Vernon Camp outside the city, an enclave that ordinary Singaporeans are not allowed to enter.A woman married to a Gurkha who lived in the camp said life there was restricted.\u201cWe have a curfew of 12 midnight,\u201d she said. \u201cFor women, we can let them know if we have a genuine reason to stay out, for men, there is no excuse.\u201cOne of the rules we have is that we have to be in bed by 10.30pm every night. This means no music, no nothing. Even if we have a party, we need to stop. If not, there will be some form of enforcement by the people patrolling.\u201d Typically recruited at 18 or 19 before being trained in Singapore, the Gurkha soldiers retire at 45 when they are repatriated. While their children attend local schools, Gurkhas are not allowed to marry local women.A handful of ex-British Army officers serve as sworn-in Singapore police in senior leadership, training and organisational roles.\u201cAlthough they are police, the links between the contingent and the British Army remain deep and strong,\u201d one British Army officer said. \u201cThey are part of a fine tradition.\u201dKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTrump offers condolences to SaudisWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAE'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown Dubai traffic, transport plans during Eid rushGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

That\u2019s what I do.\u201dTheir meeting is scheduled for 9am Singapore time (5am UAE).\u00a0APFor the better part of an hour, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will square off one on one, alone but for a pair of translators. That\u2019s raising concerns about the risk of holding such a monumental meeting with barely anyone to bear witness.Trump and Kim will meet on Singapore\u2019s Sentosa Island for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.The huddle will come before a larger meeting and a working lunch attended by top advisers to the president and their North Korean counterparts.Word of the private meeting unleashed a torrent of criticism on social media from national security veterans who worry the lack of a transcript will create a he-said-he-said showdown that could turn into a major headache for Trump.\u00a0AFPSingapore: Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will make history on Tuesday, becoming the first sitting US and North Korean leaders to meet, shake hands and negotiate to end a decades-old nuclear stand-off.The extraordinary summit \u2014 unthinkable only months ago \u2014 comes after the two nuclear-armed foes appeared on the verge of conflict late last year as they slung personal insults and Kim conducted nuclear and missile tests.Trump called on the international community to exert \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to buckle Kim\u2019s regime and threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if Pyongyang continued to threaten the US.For his part, Kim called Trump a \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d and said he would \u201ctame\u201d him, \u201cwith fire\u201d.That will seem a distant memory later Tuesday amid the palms and whitewashed walls of Singapore\u2019s ultra-exclusive Capella Hotel, where the two men will walk towards each other and then sit down for an initial half-day of meetings with ramifications for the entire world.It is a historic meeting for both men \u2014 perhaps comparable to president Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 visit to China, or Ronald Reagan\u2019s summit 1986 with Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik.It is potentially legacy-defining \u2014 as long as they can disprove critics\u2019 fears that the meeting will be more about drama than detail.The North has promised to give up its weapons in the past, while a long history of previous agreements have ultimately foundered.\u201cIf there is no statement of intentions to move toward a peace treaty, if there\u2019s no statement from the North Korean side on denuclearisation, we\u2019re going to find ourselves very quickly in a very hollow summit,\u201d said Ryan Hass of the Brookings Institution.If that happened, he added, \u201cquickly we\u2019ll move into a space of mutual recrimination and finger-pointing about whose fault it was\u201d.On the eve of the summit, Trump \u2014 who is due to leave Singapore on Tuesday evening \u2014 said optimistically: \u201cI just think it\u2019s going to work out very nicely.\u201dHugely symbolic talksThe pair \u2014 Kim in his thirties and consolidating his dictatorship, Trump in his seventies and struggling to bend Washington to his impetuous will \u2014 are unlikely protagonists, both instantly recognisable and larger-than-life.But their work this week is deadly serious.Washington and Pyongyang are still technically at war, even if the mortars, carbines and gunships of the bloody 1950s conflict have long since fallen silent.And the totalitarian regime has made rapid progress towards marrying nuclear and missile technology that would put Los Angeles, New York and Washington within striking distance of a nuclear holocaust.The United States says that is unacceptable and will be dealt with, one way or another.But for North Korea the mere fact of the talks is a hugely symbolic advance.For its leader, standing as an equal beside the US president in front of a phalanx of cameras is a goal the pariah state has sought for decades, with critics charging that it legitimises one of the most ruthless regimes.On Monday evening Kim \u2014 accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards and his personal television crew \u2014 took a night-time stroll on the Singapore waterfront, even posing for grinning selfies with the city-state\u2019s foreign minister.\u2018Brighter future\u2019Yet it remains far from clear that Pyongyang is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, which it says it needs to defend itself against a US invasion.On the eve of the meeting, aides from both sides were still scrambling to narrow yawning differences over \u201cdenuclearisation\u201d, which means vastly different things to the two parties.Trump will use what he says are long-honed instincts to see whether Kim if bluffing, buying time or serious.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the United States was willing to offer the regime \u201cunique\u201d security guarantees, to \u201cprovide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearisation is not something that ends badly for them\u201d.Kim and Trump will first meet one-on-one in a closed session, before a larger meeting with key advisers, US officials said.But Pompeo signalled that the summit was likely to be the start of a longer process of negotiation, and warned the United States would not be \u201cduped\u201d, with nothing less than complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation considered.Max - 24 \u00b0CMin - 20 \u00b0CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged

And while the summit was heavy on pointed moments, it has \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 offered the prospect of a Korean peninsula that is committed to peace.On his part, Kim committed his nation to the complete demilitarisation of the Korean peninsula, while the US offered a security pledge that would eliminate the threat of conflict. One immediate effect of this was that Washington has cancelled its military exercises with South Korea. Both Kim and Trump have also committed themselves to the peace overtures agreed between Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea when they met in a historic meeting at the Demilitarised Zone in April. Indeed, this aspect of the Singapore summit serves as a timely reminder that North and South remain technically in a state of war with the Korean War ending nearly 65 years ago in a cessation of hostilities.It is always hard to fathom the immediate results of any much-anticipated meeting between adversaries. The very fact that both Trump and Kim met is a success in itself, given that the summit seemed as if it would be cancelled \u2014 a threat that underlined the distrust between Washington and Pyongyang. Yes, there is a commitment to denuclearisation on the peninsula, but that is one that both the US and North Korea have signed before in 2005. Certainly, the fact that both men met within six months of threatening to unleash nuclear devastation from their atomic arsenals shows that progress has been made.There is a reality too, however, that the regime in Pyongyang has a long and chequered history of promising concessions and then reneging on them \u2014 and that 2005 agreement is a casualty of Korean convenience in that regard. It ought to be remembered that it has taken the imposition of severe economic and financial sanctions against Pyongyang to get it to the table \u2014 along with the threat of military action. Yes, the Singapore summit marked an opportunity to reset relations. But real progress can only be measured by verifiable and unfettered inspections, and by adherence to specific targets and goals. The threat of those sanctions must remain a presence now moving forward. It\u2019s one thing to commit to denuclearisation, another to adhere to that commitment away from the pomp and circumstance of summitry.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedTrump: McGahn allowed to cooperate with MuellerTrump increasingly takes aim at ChinaFuture political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...For balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTrump offers condolences to SaudisWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAE'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown Dubai traffic, transport plans during Eid rushGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Trump said he thinks the summit went \"better than anybody could have expected.\"As they began the summit, Trump said he thinks he and Kim will have a \"terrific relationship,\" and Kim, through a translator, said North Korea had to overcome a number of \"obstacles\" to get to this moment.Trump and Kim participated held a one-on-one meeting, with translators only, followed by an expanded meeting including their top advisers, and a working lunch.This is the Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit, as published by international media.President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new US-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.Convinced that the establishment of new US-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognising that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following:The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.The United States and DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean PeninsulaThe United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.Having acknowledged that the US-DPRK summit \u2014 the first in history \u2014 was an epochal event of great significance in overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening up of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un commit to implement the stipulations in the joint statement fully and expeditiously.The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-on negotiations, led by the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the US-DPRK summit.President Donald J.

And how can anyone be sure that North Korea is really denuclearising? A look at some of the questions.1. Between Trump and Kim, who got the better deal? Both Trump and Kim got things they want. Trump appears to have resolved the immediate threat of war and cast himself as a peacemaker. But Kim\u2019s wins \u2014 suspended US military drills, new international status, improved relations with China and South Korea and talk of easing sanctions \u2014 are more substantial.2. What are the chances that the Koreas will actually be united as one nation?They\u2019re better now than they were a year ago. But reconciling the two political systems is daunting. More likely is decades of economic and cultural integration before anything that could be described as unification is possible.3. How will this change relations between the US and South Korea, particularly the presence of US troops?So far, Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are pretty much in line. There are still few details about Trump\u2019s decision to suspend US \u201cwar games\u201d in South Korea, which could fuel discussion about a weakening of the alliance. While Trump has talked about lowering overseas troop deployments, he says that\u2019s not on the table for South Korea right now.4. What do we now know about Kim that we didn\u2019t know before, based on his presence at the summit?We know that Kim is far less cautious about his public appearances than many had surmised. He didn\u2019t look exactly comfortable strolling around Singapore\u2019s tourist spots surrounded by a phalanx of guards, but he spent more than two hours out on the town, and seemed happy to have those images published back in Pyongyang.5. How can anyone be sure that North Korea is really denuclearising? And how can the US make sure Kim will keep his commitments?That\u2019s perhaps the biggest of the many questions left unanswered by this joint statement yesterday. Not only was there no mention of verification and inspection, but the two sides didn\u2019t establish what denuclearisation means. Asked about this yesterday, Trump said: \u201cI think he wants to get it done. I really feel that very strongly.\u201d6. Apart from denuclearisation, could you give a quick recap of what was agreed to at the summit and what we need to watch for in the coming months?There are four main points of the joint statement: establishing new US-North Korea relations, building a lasting and stable peace regime, reaffirming North Korea\u2019s commitment to \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d and repatriating American war dead. There\u2019s also Trump\u2019s decision to suspend military exercises.7. Did Trump or Kim say anything about the human rights record of North Korea? How will this rapprochement affect ordinary North Koreans?This question led to some of the most interesting exchanges during Trump\u2019s sprawling news conference after the signing with Kim. First, Trump acknowledged that human rights was not a major topic during the meeting, saying it \u201cwas discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearisation.\u201d When pressed later about whether he had betrayed the political prisoners in North Korean gulags, Trump suggested that improving relations would help them.8. Who made this summit possible, and why wasn\u2019t South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited?A lot of people can claim credit for making the summit happen, Kim and Trump, obviously. But Moon played a key role in opening the dialogue and getting things back on track after Trump cancelled the meeting last month. China and Singapore also provided key logistical support.9. Is this summit a game-changer for Asia and the rest of the world? Which countries have the most riding on a concrete peace deal?Rather than a game-changer, this was more of a breakthrough in how the US and North Korea talk to each other. Having open channels of communication can only minimise the risk of miscalculation. North Korea and South Korea have the most riding on a peace deal, but China, which is next door, is probably next in line.10. What have observers been saying about the possibility of Trump (or Kim) getting a Nobel Peace Prize?Moon says Trump deserves a Peace Prize. Others might say it\u2019s Moon who is probably more deserving, since he was pushing Trump and Kim toward peace when they were still both threatening nuclear war. Others might say let\u2019s wait until there\u2019s an actual peace deal before we start doling out accolades.11. Why has it taken this long to get North Korea to the table? What\u2019s the best-case and worst-case scenario we can hope for?North Korea has resisted talks over the years because it disagreed with the US\u2019s preconditions \u2014 mainly, a clear commitment to an inspection-and-verification regime. But it has long wanted a meeting with a US president. Trump\u2019s decision to meet Kim without that clear path to denuclearisation removed the roadblock.Best-case scenario is the two sides start talking, North Korea decides the US is no longer a threat and scales back its arsenal. Worst case is the US decides North Korea isn\u2019t cooperating and we go back to war threats.12. After all those nuclear and missile tests, it seems as if Kim Jong-un has suddenly signalled he wants peace. Why the change of strategy?There is not enough known about North Korea to fully explain Kim\u2019s motivations. But the North Koreans have expertly escalated and de-escalated tensions to suit their needs over the years. Now that Kim has a hydrogen bomb and missiles that can deliver it to the US, he says he doesn\u2019t need to test them anymore and can dedicate more of his resources toward the economy.Also, this has been a long time coming. Kim has put an increasing focus on developing his nation\u2019s economy since he came to power in 2011.Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTrump offers condolences to SaudisWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAE'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown Dubai traffic, transport plans during Eid rushGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Both Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump are right to assure that they will indeed meet June 12 in Singapore. The planning now finally being put in place at meetings in Panmunjom and at the White House is a key to success and must be taken seriously and used smartly. There is much to do, the time is short, and the trail is complex and tricky.We welcome the efforts to open communications between the United States and North Korea facilitated by the diplomatic efforts of South Korea. We also recognise that one meeting \u2014 even a summit \u2014 cannot be expected to produce an immediate solution to the decades-old North Korean nuclear problem. This is just the beginning of a long process that will require persistence and patience to succeed.Current circumstances could open the door to bringing about goals the key participants have said they wish to achieve. North Korea\u2019s leadership appears to wants a more secure and productive relationship with its neighbours and with the broader global community, especially the US.South Korea wants a stable and peaceful relationship with its northern neighbour that offers opportunities for development of the peninsula. The US \u2014 and the rest of the international community \u2014 needs to see an end to North Korea\u2019s experiment with nuclear weapons and intercontinental delivery vehicles.And China seeks a Korean Peninsula on its border functioning in a way that produces stability and confidence rather than uncertainty and potential conflict.What can this summit achieve?First and foremost, it must produce an agreed-upon statement committing the parties not only to a permanent end to hostilities but to the complete, irreversible, full and verifiable denuclearisation of the peninsula. Those who see this as a measure to be taken in one leap must also see the hard reality. As Trump has noted, steps and stages may be the only secure and permanent way to achieve that main goal.Second, a freeze in missile and nuclear-weapons testing is clearly needed, certainly for as long as conversations continue on the main goals of peace and denuclearisation.The US has shown it is prepared to demonstrate that its regular joint exercises with South Korea are defensive in nature, do not envision the use of nuclear weapons and are not an attempt to decapitate the North Korean leadership.Avoiding misunderstandingsIt is critical that the summit yield a precise understanding of these first reciprocal steps to avoid misunderstandings such as the confusion last month over the presence of American B-52 bombers in the area.Third, it is necessary to begin moving down the more difficult road of eliminating the production of fissile material for weapons use. North Korea should reaffirm its September 2005 commitment to the Six-Party agreement by abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to safeguards established by the International Atomic Energy Agency.For its part, the United States should reiterate the affirmation made in that statement that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and has no intention to attack North Korea with either nuclear or conventional weapons.In a parallel process, South Korea should also reiterate its commitment not to receive or deploy nuclear weapons, while reaffirming that there are no such weapons within its borders.Early steps in that regard would be a declaration by all concerned parties of the existence and location of all facilities either engaged \u2014 or that could be engaged \u2014 in nuclear weapons-related activities; an agreement to cease all weapons development; and the application of reciprocal arrangements for verification.In return, in addition to humanitarian and economic support already noted publicly, the United States should agree to a dedicated energy programme for North Korea based in part on past efforts related to peaceful production of nuclear energy. This would ensure that reciprocity, balance and proportion are part of the process.The summit should thus be designed as a launch pad for sustained, structured negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of the North Korean nuclear-weapons programme, while taking concrete steps that reduce tensions and encourage North Korea\u2019s continuing compliance.Such a sustained and smart diplomatic effort is the only viable means to resolving the challenges posed by North Korea. We should all stand ready to promote and support that effort.\u2014 Washington PostChristopher R.

The floods are the worst in a century.In the latest bout that began nine days ago, 164 people have died and some 223,000 moved into more than 1500 relief camps, Vijayan said.Heavy rains began hitting parts of the state again on Saturday morning, slowing attempts to deploy rescuers and get relief supplies to isolated areas, many of which have seen no help for days and can only be reached by boat or helicopter.Rains are expected to subside to \u201clight to moderate\u201d levels on Sunday, India\u2019s weather office said.A witness in a relief helicopter in Chengannur, a town in southern Kerala, saw people stranded on roof tops and waving desperately for help.\u201cThe town looked like an island dotted with houses and cars submerged in muddy flood waters and downed coconut trees,\u201d he said.Two circling navy helicopters dropped food and water in metal baskets and flown out at least four people, including a three-year-old child.Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, said his department had geared up to meet victims\u2019 needs.\u201cWe\u2019ve deployed adequate doctors and staff and provided all essential medicines in the relief camps,\u201d he said.His teams were also making arrangements to minimise the risk of people contracting waterborne diseases once they return home after the floodwaters subside.The rains have also disrupted transport networks in Kerala, a major destination for domestic and foreign tourists.Some crops have also been inundated.

Photo: APMORE than 400 people have died since heavy rain hit Kerala in recent weeks, triggering deadly landslides and submerging entire villages as rivers burst their banks. The rain had barely stopped falling in the town on the outskirts of the southern Indian state\u2019s main city, Kochi, and abandoned cars, sodden furniture and mattresses filled the streets while dirty black water still flowed above knee-level.A foul smell greeted people arriving at the Union Christian College, where classrooms and halls became a relief camp for up to 4000 at the peak of the floods.Some have started to leave. Residents who remain speculated that the stench was from rubbish and dead cats, dogs and rats \u2014 or worse.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s human,\u201d said one survivor.Savita Saha, one of the migrants in the big hall, said: \u201cThis smell is of five days without a bath\u201d, adding, \u201cEveryone here is wearing the clothes they had when they escaped.In one classroom Rasitha Sojith, from the nearby neighbourhood of Kaprassery, sobbed as she told how she escaped through chest-high waters carrying her two-month-old son.Sojith said water burst into her home without warning last Wednesday while her father and sister, with her three children, were visiting to see the new baby.\u201cWith water rising fast, we only grabbed a few clothes for the baby and went to the first-floor terrace of the neighbour\u2019s house,\u201d she said.Torrential rain fell for hours and they grew increasingly fearful of becoming trapped, until local fishermen rowed the family to safety the next day.\u201cEverything is lost. Everything! We don\u2019t even have money to go back to our neighbourhood,\u201d said Sojith.\u201cI don\u2019t think we will be leaving this camp any time soon.\u201dAn estimated 725,000 people are crammed into similar makeshift camps across Kerala.Authorities have given a provisional damage toll of $3 billion but the extent of the destruction is likely to prove much greater, some officials and legislators say.In the Malikampeedika area of Kochi, Mumthaz, who goes by one name, found the smell waiting for her when she returned home.\u201cThis muddy rubble and stench is all that is left of our memories,\u201d Mumthaz told AFP, as she dragged out mud-caked mattresses and a sofa set, damaged utensils and even her daughters\u2019 school awards.As word spread of flood warnings, Mumthaz had taken her two daughters on Thursday to the home of her parents-in-law in another neighbourhood.But floodwater soon surged through their house as well and the whole family had to be rescued.\u201cIt was surreal. The water was close to the knees at one point and within a few minutes it was touching five feet, with a current so strong that we saw big cars floating like tin cans,\u201d she said.With her husband searching for work in Dubai, Mumthaz knows she will struggle to look after her daughters, with the family facing an uncertain future after the nightmare of the floods.\u201cThere is no kitchen, electricity and water here. I don\u2019t know how long it will take before I will be back \u2026 (in) my home,\u201d she said.To join the conversation, please Log in. Don't have an account?

As the southwestern coastal state's chief minister sought military reinforcements to boost rescue efforts, a disaster management official said that, since the monsoon season started about three months ago, more than 320 people had died due to flooding and landslides. As the waters have risen, many people have found it increasingly hard to access food and other basic amenities, or to reach safety. During the current monsoon, Kerala has been hit with over a third more rain than average, according to India's weather office. The floods are the worst in a century. In the latest bout that began nine days ago, 164 people have died and some 223,000 moved into more than 1500 relief camps, Vijayan said. Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for most parts of the state on Saturday, and authorities said they planned to implement controlled releases of water from dams to manage flows and minimise damage. Rains are expected to subside to \"light to moderate\" levels on Sunday, India's weather office said. A witness in a relief helicopter in Chengannur, a town in southern Kerala, saw people stranded on roof tops and waving desperately for help. \"The town looked like an island dotted with houses and cars submerged in muddy flood waters and downed coconut trees,\" he said. Two circling navy helicopters dropped food and water in metal baskets and flown out at least four people, including a three-year-old child. Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, said his department had geared up to meet victims' needs. \"We've deployed adequate doctors and staff and provided all essential medicines in the relief camps,\" he said. His teams were also making arrangements to minimise the risk of people contracting waterborne diseases once they return home after the floodwaters subside. The rains have also disrupted transport networks in Kerala, a major destination for domestic and foreign tourists. Some crops have also been inundated. The state is a major producer of rubber, tea, coffee and spices such as black pepper and cardamom. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter he would travel to Kerala \"to take stock of the unfortunate situation\"."}{"head": " 800,000 displaced in flooding in southern Indian state  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " Around 800,000 people have been displaced and more than 350 have died in the worst flooding in a century in southern India's Kerala state, officials said as rescuers searched for people stranded in the worst-affected areas.

Thousands of rescuers were continuing efforts to reach out to stranded people and get relief supplies to isolated areas by hundreds of boats and nearly two dozen helicopters, said P.H. Kurian, a top disaster management official in Kerala. He said weather conditions had improved considerably and expected the nearly 10,000 people still stranded to be rescued by today. An estimated 800,000 people have taken shelter in around 4000 relief camps across Kerala, Kurian said. Weather officials predicted more rains across the state yesterday.

However, vast rice fields continued to be marooned and many vehicles were submerged. In some villages, floodwaters up to 3m high had entered homes. Officials have called it the worst flooding in Kerala in a century, with twice the rainfall of a typical monsoon season in some areas. Officials estimate that more than 10,000km of roads have been damaged. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised more than US$70 million ($105.7m) in aid.

Its lead author, Pune-based ecologist Madhav Gadgil, has publicly argued that had the report\u2019s suggestions been implemented by the concerned state governments, the scale of disaster in Kerala would not have been as huge as it is. A look at some of the main recommendations of the Gadgil report, how these were substantially relaxed by a subsequent committee led by space scientist K Kasturirangan, and whether implementation of the first report would have made any difference to the Kerala crisis:Why was the Gadgil Committee set up?In February 2010, then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh attended a public meeting in Kotagiri in Tamil Nadu organised mainly by those associated with Save the Western Ghats group. Speakers pointed to threats to the ecosystem from construction, mining, industries, real estate, and hydropower. After the meeting, Ramesh set up the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel under Gadgil. The panel was asked to make an assessment of the ecology and biodiversity of the Western Ghats and suggest measures to conserve, protect and rejuvenate the entire range that stretches to over 1500 km along the coast, with its footprints in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.READ |\u00a0Kerala tragedy partly man made: Madhav Gadgil, expert who headed Western Ghats\u00a0reportWhat did the Gadgil Committee say?It defined the boundaries of the Western Ghats for the purposes of ecological management. The total area in this boundary came to 1,29,037 square km, running about 1.490 km north to south, with a maximum width of 210 km in Tamil Nadu and minimum of 48 km in Maharashtra. It proposed that this entire area be designated as ecologically sensitive area (ESA). Within this area, smaller regions were to be identified as ecologically sensitive zones (ESZ) I, II or III based on their existing condition and nature of threat. It proposed to divide the area into about 2,200 grids, each approximately 9 km \u00d7 9 km, of which 75 per cent would fall under ESZ I or II or under already existing protected areas such as wildlife sanctuaries or natural parks.It recommended:* Ban on cultivation of genetically modified in entire area\n* Plastic bags to be phased out in three years\n* No new special economic zones or hill stations to be allowed\n* Ban on conversion of public lands to private lands, and on diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes in ESZ I and II\n* No new mining licences in ESZ I and II area\n* No new dams in ESZ I\n* No new thermal power plants or large scale wind power projects in ESZ I\n* No new polluting industries in ESZ I and ESZ II areas\n* No new railway lines or major roads in ESZ I and II areas\n* Strict regulation of tourism\n* Cumulative impact assessment for all new projects like dams, mines, tourism, housing\n* Phase-out of all chemical pesticides within five to eight years in ESZ I and ESZ IIThe committee proposed a Western Ghats Ecology Authority to regulate these activities in the area.READ |\u00a0\u2018Floods in Kerala grave\u2026 political lobbying prevented implementation of Gadgil\u00a0report\u2019What was the need for the subsequent Kasturirangan Committee?None of the six concerned states agreed with the recommendations of the Gadgil Committee, which submitted its report in August 2011 (its official public release was cancelled). Suggestions and comments were received from a number of others as well. In August 2012, then Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan constituted a High-Level Working Group on Western Ghats under Kasturirangan to \u201cexamine\u201d the Gadgil Committee report in a \u201cholistic and multidisciplinary fashion in the light of responses received\u201d from states, central ministries and others. This committee submitted its report in April 2013.Its report revealed that of the nearly 1,750 responses it had examined, 81% were not in favour of the Gadgil recommendations. In particular, Kerala had objected to the proposed ban on sand mining and quarrying, restrictions on transport infrastructure and wind energy projects, embargos on hydroelectric projects, and inter-basin transfer of river waters, and also the complete ban on new polluting industries.So, what did the Kasturirangan Committee say?It broadened the definition of Western Ghats and included a total of 1,64,280 square km in it. It then classified it as comprising cultural landscape and natural landscape. It said nearly 60% of the Western Ghats was cultural landscape, where human settlements, agriculture and plantations existed. The remaining was natural landscape, of which the \u201cbiologically rich\u201d area was only 37% or about 60,000 sq km. It was only this part that the committee said needed to be classified as ecologically sensitive area (ESA)Its main recommendations for ESA* Ban on mining, quarrying and sand mining\n* No new thermal power projects, but hydro power projects allowed with restrictions\n* Ban on new polluting industries\n* Building and construction projects up to 20,000 sq m was to be allowed but townships were to be banned\n* Forest diversion could be allowed with extra safeguardsWhat was finally decided?Last year, the Environment Ministry notified an area of 56,285 sq km in the Western Ghats as ESA. This was slightly less than the 59,940 sq km recommended by the Kasturirangan committee. In Kerala, specifically, the Kasturirangan committee had proposed an area of 13,108 square km as part of ESA. This was brought down to 9,993.7 sq km at the insistence of Kerala government.Would implementation of the Gadgil report have lessened the impact of the Kerala floods?The Kerala disaster essentially has been caused by extreme rainfall. Since the 2013 Uttarakhand flooding, such extreme rainfall events have led to one disaster-like situation in India every year. The Gadgil report was submitted in 2011. Even if the state governments had begun implementing the recommendations in all seriousness immediately thereafter, it is not clear what activities would have stopped. What Gadgil seems to be arguing for is the need to learn lessons from past tragedies, and increase the resilience of disaster-struck areas through sustainable and long-term development that would involve minimal intervention in natural processes. Even in the Uttarakhand disaster, uncontrolled construction, large hydropower plants and deforestation were assessed to have aided the scale of destruction.\n<img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/amitabh-sinha.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />Amitabh SinhaAmitabh Sinha is Resident Editor, Pune.

The news of the tragedy only reached Bangkok yesterday morning.\nHouses in Attapeu\u2019s southern Sanamxay district were swept away, claiming lives, and several hundred people were missing, according to the state-run Lao News Agency.\nPrime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith suspended his monthly cabinet meeting and led senior government officials to Sanamxay to monitor rescue and relief efforts.\nThe collapse of the support dam caused flash flooding in six Sanamxay villages \u2013 Yai Thae, Hinlad, Mai, Thasengchan, Tha Hin and Samong. Hinlad and Mai were particularly hard hit.\nPictures and videos shown on state-run and social media showed the chaotic evacuation of people from inundated areas. Many people were seen clinging to the roofs of their houses, surrounded by water.\u00a0\nThere were claims on social media of many people dead and missing, but no official report from local authorities as of press time.\nAuthorities in Attapeu pleaded for agencies to provide emergency aid for the victims, including clothing, food, drinking water and medicine.\nAttapeu Planning and Investment Department Director Soulichanh Phonkeo told the Vientiane Times newspaper that some victims were washed away in the torrent, but many managed to grab tree branches and wait for rescue.\n\u201cWe need a large number of boats to rescue them from the danger area,\u201d he said.\nAn official of Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Co (PNPC) had on Monday issued a warning of danger at the dam. In a letter, the company\u2019s head of resettlement, Lee Kan Yeol, told colleagues in Champasak and Attapeu provinces that, \u201cSaddle Dam D is not safe and is in very dangerous condition\u201d due to heavy rainfall.\nHe advised that the saddle dam\u2019s failure would unleash five billion tonnes of water into the Xe Pian River basin. Lee said people living along the river downstream should be moved to higher ground to avoid an \u201cunfortunate accident\u201d if the heavy rain caused one.\nThe 410-megawatt Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy Dam is expected to generate 1,860 gigawatt-hours of power when completed. The project is budgeted for US$1.2 (Bt40 billion).\nPNPC is a joint venture formed in March 2012 by SK Engineering and Construction (which has a 24-per-cent stake), Lao Holding State Enterprise (26 per cent) and Korea Western Power and Thailand\u2019s Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding (RATCH), which together hold the balance of shares.\nRATCH director Kijja Sripatthangkura said Saddle Dam D was one of five sections surrounding the main dam and its collapse would not affect power production from the project.\u00a0\nBut he noted that 600 million cubic metres of water had flooded seven villages and affected more than 6,000 people in 1,700 households. His company was coordinating with officials at the site about repairing the damage, he said, but the work could not begin until more water can be released from the main dam.\nPianporn Deetes of the conservation group International Rivers said there were major risks with dams that are not designed to cope with extreme weather conditions such as very heavy rain. And unpredictable extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in the region due to climate change, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cThis disaster also shows the inadequacy of warning systems for the dam construction and operations,\u201d said Pianporn, who has long monitored dams in the Mekong River basin.\u00a0\n\u201cThe warning appears to have to come very late and was ineffective in giving people advance notice to ensure their families\u2019 safety.\u201d"}{"head": "Bodies found as floods recede in India's Kerala state", "classes": ["author-section", "byline-plain", "byline-section", "count-number", "count-text", "modal-title", "modal-subtitle", "modal-title", "modal-subtitle"], "content": "By\n\nBridie Pearson-jones For Mailonline\n\n\nand \nAfp\n\nPublished:\n  06:22 BST, 20 August 2018\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  00:28 BST, 21 August 2018\n\n           3View  commentsJust awful!

There are long queues at the school's few toilets and no bathroom to wash in.\"Everyone here is wearing the clothes they had when they escaped,\" she said, squeezed onto a jute mat with her husband, who works at a cashew factory in Kochi.In one classroom, Rasitha Sojith, from the nearby town of Kaprassery, sobbed as she told of how she escaped through chest-high waters carrying her two-month-old son.Sojith said water had burst into her home without warning last Wednesday while her father and sister with her three children were visiting to see the new baby.\"With water rising fast, we only grabbed a few clothes for the baby and went to the first-floor terrace of the neighbour's house,\" she said.Torrential rain fell for hours as their fear of being trapped mounted, until local fishermen rowed the family to safety the next day.\"Everything is lost. Everything! We don't even have money to go back to our neighbourhood,\" said Sojith.\"I don't think we will be leaving this camp any time soon.\"- Muddy rubble -An estimated 725,000 people are crammed into similar makeshift camps across Kerala.Authorities have given a provisional damage toll of $3 billion but the extent of the destruction is likely to prove much greater, some officials and legislators say.In the Malikampeedika area of Kochi, Mumthaz, who goes by one name, found the smell waiting for her when she returned to her home.\"This muddy rubble and stench is all that is left of our memories,\" Mumthaz told AFP, as she dragged out mud-caked mattresses and a sofa set, damaged utensils and even her daughters' school awards.As word spread of flood warnings, Mumthaz had taken her two daughters on Thursday to the home of her parents-in-law, in another neighbourhood.But floodwaters soon surged through their house as well and the whole family had to be rescued.\"It was surreal. The water was close to the knees at one point and within a few minutes it was touching five feet, with a current so strong that we saw big cars floating like tin cans,\" she said.With her husband searching for work in Dubai, Mumthaz knows she will struggle to look after her daughters, with the family facing an uncertain future after the nightmare of the floods.\"There is no kitchen, electricity and water here.

Nadda said more than 3,500 medical camps were set up across a region roughly the size of Switzerland, where rains since Aug. 8 have swelled rivers and triggered landslides.\"There is a requirement for 90 different medicines and the first instalment has reached,\" he added.\"The biggest challenges immediately ahead are cleaning of the flood-hit houses, rehabilitation, and prevention of water-borne diseases,\" said Mahesh P., a village official in Rayamangalam, about 45 km (28 miles) from Kerala's financial capital of Kochi.

The camps accommodate people rescued from neighbouring areas, which were among the worst affected.The villagers had all pulled together to rescue people and prevent an even bigger disaster, Mahesh said. \"The flood has bonded the people like never before, sharing whatever they had.\"Chlorine powder to disinfect water and other cleaning material are distributed by the camps Mahesh oversees, along with a basic survival kit consisting of a five-day supply of rice and food, toiletries and clothing.LONG QUEUESLight to moderate rain was expected across Kerala on Monday, promising respite to rescue workers, who have battled rising waters and mudslides to reach tens of thousands of stranded villagers.In one of the worst-hit areas, Chengannur, about 100 km (62 miles) from Kochi, a long queue of women snaked out of a medical camp at the main relief centre.As a helicopter hovered overhead, doctors checked elderly men and women lying on wooden benches in an engineering college.\"People are being screened for respiratory infections,\" said a camp doctor, Rajesh Parameshwaran, adding that another infection doctors were targeted was leptospirosis, which can strike people wading through stagnant water.Those returning home from the camps as the waters recede face a difficult clean-up job.The insides of many homes will have about 60 cm (24 inches) of mud, officials said. Wells, commonly used in Kerala, are contaminated and few places have electricity to pump water.Kochi's airport has suspended operations until Sunday due to waterlogging.

But without a yardstick for such a declaration, it could be an uphill task.Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, urged Modi not to discriminate between states controlled by his Bharatiya Janata Party and those such as Kerala, which it does not rule.The state, ruled by the communist party, has received just a third of the immediate assistance of 20 billion rupees ($285 million) it sought from the federal government.

He blasted the clerical culture that has been blamed for the crisis, with church leaders more concerned for their reputation than the safety of children.\"With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives,\" Francis wrote. \"We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them.\"The Vatican issued the three-page letter ahead of Francis' trip this weekend to Ireland, a once staunchly Roman Catholic country where the church's credibility has been devastated by years of revelations that priests raped and molested children with impunity and their superiors covered up for them.Priestly sex abuse was always expected to dominate the trip, but the issue has taken on new gravity following revelations in the U.S. that one of Francis' trusted cardinals, the retired archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick, allegedly sexually abused and harassed minors as well as adult seminarians.In addition, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania last week reported that at least 1,000 children were victims of some 300 priests over the past 70 years, and that generations of bishops failed repeatedly to take measures to protect their flock or punish the rapists.In the letter, which was issued in seven languages, Francis referred to the Pennsylvania report, acknowledged that no effort to beg forgiveness of the victims will be sufficient but vowed \"never again.\"He said, looking to the future, \"no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated.\"Francis didn't, however, provide any indication of what concrete measures he is prepared to take to sanction those bishops \u2014 in the U.S. and beyond \u2014 who covered up for sexually abusive priests.Francis several years ago scrapped a proposed Vatican tribunal to prosecute negligent bishops, and he has refused to act on credible reports from around the world of bishops who have failed to report abusers to police or otherwise botched handling cases, and yet remain in office.Francis also has kept on his nine-member kitchen cabinet a Chilean cardinal long accused of covering up for pedophiles, an Australian cardinal currently on trial for historic sex abuse charges and a Honduran cardinal recently implicated in a gay priest sex scandal involving his trusted deputy.In Chile, where a church sex abuse scandal exploded earlier this year, Francis strong-armed the country's 31 active bishops to offer their resignations en masse over their handling of abuse. So far he has accepted five of their resignations.Unlike the U.S. bishops' conference, which has referred only to \"sins and omissions\" in their handling of abuse in response to the Pennsylvania report, Francis labeled the misconduct \"crimes.\"\"Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,\" he wrote in the letter. \"An awareness of sin helps us to acknowledge the errors, the crimes and the wounds caused in the past and allows us, in the present, to be more open and committed along a journey of renewed conversion.\"It was the second Vatican response in recent days to the Pennsylvania grand jury report, which has sparked a crisis in confidence in the U.S. Catholic leadership and led to calls for ordinary faithful to withhold donations.Last week, the Vatican spokesman issued a statement calling the abuses described in the report \"criminal and morally reprehensible\" and said there must be accountability for those who raped children \"and those who permitted abuse to occur.\"Subsequently, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said it was planning to ask Francis to authorize a Vatican investigation into the McCarrick scandal, since it was apparently an open secret in some Catholic circles that the cardinal regularly invited seminarians to his New Jersey beach house, and into his bed.There has been no comment from the Vatican as to whether the pope would approve such an investigation. The question is delicate, given there is evidence that Vatican officials knew as early as 2000 of McCarrick's penchant for seminarians, yet still appointed him as Washington archbishop and a cardinal.The Vatican has long been loath to investigate its own, especially since many of the Vatican officials in charge in 2000 are still alive, albeit retired.Any investigation into McCarrick that goes to the top would likely implicate St. John Paul II and his closest advisers.

deeply pained over the recent flood disaster that destroyed farmlands and crops and a setback for the efforts of the government to boost local rice production in the country, for which Kebbi State plays a leading role.\nWhile reacting to the latest outbreak of the natural disaster that has affected a number of states in this year\u2019s rainy season, President Buhari said he was \u201chighly touched by the sheer scale of the losses suffered by our hard working farmers in Kebbi State.\u201dAccording to him, \u201cthis sad news couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for this administration because of the role of Kebbi State farmers in supporting the government\u2019s initiative to promote local rice production as part of efforts to reduce Nigeria\u2019s dependence on importation of the commodity. \u201cThis flood disaster represents a setback for the efforts to boost local rice production in the country, for which Kebbi State is playing a leading role.\u201d\u201cApart from creating job opportunities and decent incomes for our farmers, President Buhari noted that agriculture plays a key role in the economy of any country. \u201cWhen our farmers are hit by these kinds of large scale losses on account of natural disasters, the government should be genuinely concerned, especially as  this unfortunate event occurred at a critical time when my administration is pursuing a policy to restore the primacy of agriculture in our national life.\u201dPresident Buhari urged the affected farmers not to despair, assuring them that they will not be forgotten by the federal government. He commended the state government led by Senator Abubakar Bagudu for the swift measures put into action to alleviate the hardship of the victims and equally directed emergency federal aid in support.EID-EL-ADHA, as it is being celebrated today by Muslims the world over, honours the monumental sacrifice that was to be...Seven-Up Bottling Company Limited (SBC) makers of 7Up, Pepsi, Mirinda, H2Oh, Teem, Mountain Dew and Aquafina have restat...2019 election: Between APC, PDP, others, who do you think will win?ENUGU\u2014FORMER Senate minority leader, Obong Godswill Akpbio, has given a glimpse of the shape Nigeria\u2019s 2019\u00a0 general ele...\u00a0Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that \u201cthe nation\u2019s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...MANY years ago, as a member of the Nigerian delegation to the Non-aligned Conference, I engaged a Nigerian vice-presiden...IN attendance at the enthronement were the deputy governor of Ondo state, Chief Agboola Ajayi, Ondo state Commissioner f...I\u00a0WAS worried when I saw a presenter on a breakfast show engaging a senator during an interview session last week.The in...THE distinguished Ghanaian diplomat and international civil servant Kofi Annan passed away on Saturday 18 August in Bern...The Director General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, revealed, at a press briefing in Abuja on 15th August 2018 that Nigeria..."}{"head": "Thousands celebrate Osun, goddess of fertility and water", "classes": [], "content": "\u201cI\u2019m dressed like a river,\u201d says priestess Osundele Okugbesan as she shows off her flowing white strapless dress and long beaded necklaces cascading down her chest.This year, as she has done for the past 35, she has come to the Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove in southwestern Nigeria to celebrate Osun, the great Yoruba goddess of fertility and water.Others have tattoos of fish on their bodies or have sewn seashells onto their dresses.Every year, the festival attracts thousands of Yorubas, an ancient ethnic group in West Africa that numbers around 40 million, the vast majority living in Nigeria.According to UNESCO which named the area a World Heritage site in 2005, the dense forest of the grove and \u201cits meandering river is dotted with sanctuaries and shrines, sculptures and art works in honour of Osun and other deities\u201d.\u201cYou do not decide to become an Osun priest,\u201d says one mother holding the hand of her little girl, whose face his half black, half white.\u201cIt\u2019s the spirit that chooses you. Look at my daughter, she was chosen too, one day she will become a great priestess,\u201d she says enigmatically before retreating.Elsewhere, priestesses prepare offerings and sacrifices to the great goddess: a heady mixture of sacrificed chickens, ochre powder, potato chips and gin.Beating drums and the sound of shots from colonial-era rifles build to a crescendo. Soon tens of thousands of people are marching past.\u2013 Trances and kola nuts \u2013\nCrowds accompany the Arugba, a virgin whose face is covered with a scarlet cloth embroidered with shells, to the river where the spirit of the water goddess lives.The wife of Sango, god of fire and thunder, once demanded a sacrifice to bring prosperity to the community, but today the virgin is just tasked with giving the offerings to the sacred river.On the riverbank, in the shade of century-old trees, a woman reads the future in kola nuts.One after another, women fall into a trance and have to be held back so that they do not drown in the river.It could all be a scene from another lifetime, were it not for the billboards advertising mobile phone services and other 21st-century wares.And yet belief in the Yoruba gods persists, unstifled by either successive Muslim jihads in the Sahel, Christian colonialists from Europe or, more recently, by evangelical pastors from Nigeria\u2019s mega-churches.These Nigerian women will turn to the beautiful Osun to give them children.\u2013 Many gods \u2013\n\u201cTraditional religion has not been killed by modern religion because it is too deeply rooted among the Yoruba people to be destroyed,\u201d said researchers Saskia Cousin and Jean-Luc Martineau in the academic journal Cahiers d\u2019Etudes Africaines.\u201cI\u2019m Christian, Muslim and a traditionalist,\u201d said Ayodele Folasade, an employee of the Osogbo museum.\u201cI pray to Allah five times a day, I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ, but I also go to worship Osun by the river,\u201d Folasade said.\u201cYoruba people say that if your prayers don\u2019t work with one God try the other ones,\u201d she said with a smile.\u201cPastors or imams say it\u2019s not good to have many gods, but almost everybody turns to Osun when they need her,\u201d said Folasade.Omitola Babaosha, a visitor to the festival, said he believed in the traditional gods but unlike others did not hide it.\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my heritage and I don\u2019t care what people say about me,\u201d said Babaosha, wearing a large white tunic.\u201cWhoever you believe in, whatever your religion, at the end of the day you need water to survive,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is no one on this earth who isn\u2019t a child of Osun,\u201d he said, hand in hand with his wife, walking in the crowd.\u201cGoing to the river to celebrate her spirit is like saying \u2018thank you\u2019 for the creation of nature.\u201dEID-EL-ADHA, as it is being celebrated today by Muslims the world over,

"CHENGANNUR \u2014 Some 800 000 people have been displaced and over 350 have died in the worst flooding in a century in southern India's Kerala state, as authorities rushed to bring drinking water to the most affected areas, officials said Sunday.At least two trains carrying about 1.5 million liters (400,000 gallons) of water were moving to the flooded areas from the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, Indian railway official Milind Deouskar said, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.Thousands of rescuers were continuing efforts to reach out to stranded people and get relief supplies to isolated areas by hundreds of boats and nearly two dozen helicopters, said P.H. Kurian, a top disaster management official in Kerala.

One of the state's major airports, in the city of Kochi, was closed this past Tuesday due to the flooding. It is scheduled to remain closed until Aug. 26.The Indian government said a naval air base in Kochi will be opened for commercial flights starting Monday morning.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspected the flooded landscape from a helicopter on Saturday and met with the state's top officials, promising more than $70 million in aid. While the central government has dispatched multiple military units to Kerala, state officials are pleading for additional help.Officials have put initial storm damage estimates at nearly $3 billion.At least 250 people have died in the flooding in a little over a week, with 31 others missing, according to Kurian.

At Tanimoto's apartment complex, about a dozen victims have been found. He and his wife grabbed the minimum necessities and walked about 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) to a fire engine Sunday after the floods and mudslides hit the complex. Debris and mudslides had stopped right outside the couple's apartment door.He thinks he and his wife are the lucky ones. \"Some of our neighbours had their apartments destroyed, others are still looking for their families.

Regional supermarket chains such as Every Co. said one outlet is closed and several other outlets shortened service hours due to delivery delays and supply shortage.Thousands of homes were still without clean water and electricity in Hiroshima and other hard-hit areas. Residents lined up for water under the scorching sun as temperatures rose to 35 Celsius (95 Fahrenheit), raising risks of heat stroke.In another hard-hit town, Ozu in Ehime prefecture, water supplies were entirely cut off and residents could not clean their mud-stained homes or even their clothes. At a major supermarket in town, employees sold bottled water and tea, cups of noodles and other preserved foods that survived the floods, while employees cleaned damaged merchandise, throwing items into dozens of plastic bags.The landslides and flooding across much of western Japan have killed at least 134 people, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. Another seven were presumed dead.Some of the thousands of residents who had been evacuated, some rescued from their rooftops, began cleaning up after the rain stopped Monday.Suga said the government set up a task force and was spending 2 billion yen ($18 million) to hasten deliveries of supplies and other support for evacuation centres and residents in the region.Earlier Tuesday, the Self-Defense Force ferried seven oil trucks from Hiroshima to Kure, a major industrial city whose 226,000 residents were cut off from the rest of the prefecture due to the disaster.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a planned July 11-18 trip to Europe and the Middle East to oversee the emergency response. The government mobilized 75,000 troops and emergency workers and nearly 80 helicopters for the search and rescue effort, Suga said.Assessment of the casualties was slowed by the scale of the area affected.

Blankets dry on iron gates in the Pretoria township and shoes absorb the sun\u2019s heat on the roofs of shacks.The russet water streams past number 251, Rose Makua\u2019s house.\nSeven people live in this stuffy dark shack: Makua, her husband, her mother-in-law, her son-in-law and her three children.This weekend, water released from a rain-swollen dam nearby seeped into the shack and rose thigh-high, soaking belongings and warping the stove and wardrobe.The flooding is not on the same scale as those in KwaZulu-Natal, which killed 20 people earlier this month, but it is a source of misery for a poor household, nonetheless.Makua points out a bucket filled with her family\u2019s ruined shoes. \u201cNow none of us has shoes to wear,\u201d she says. A broken foam mattress is perched over the fence to dry out. \u201cThe babies were sleeping on the floor,\u201d she explains.Her first born is 17 years old and suffers from asthma. She has been sent to live with relatives because her condition is aggravated by living in the shack.Makua has lived at number 251 for more than 15 years and this is the second bout of flooding she has experienced. \u201cBut this time, it was really terrible.\u201d8490 shacks hit\nHers is just one of 8\u00a0490 shacks hit by the flooding in Mamelodi as a result of heavy rains on December 19 and again in early January.Across South Africa, in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and the North West, floods caused by heavy summer rains have caused massive damage to households and have claimed at least 32 lives.A statement released by the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs on Wednesday said the total damage was yet to be assessed.Information from hard-hit communities is still being coordinated by the department\u2019s National Disaster Management Centre.However, the statement said that up to 500 houses could have been damaged in Gauteng and that 12 people had died in the province. In KwaZulu-Natal about 200 households have been affected, 20 people have lost their lives and nine have been seriously injured.Last week CNN reported that at least 50 people had died after floods in the Eastern Cape and hundreds more had been made homeless. And on Wednesday the Sowetan reported that four people were believed to have drowned in Limpopo and six in Mpumalanga.Makua and other residents of Mamelodi gathered on the dirt road to collect handouts from the Gift of the Givers Foundation, which is providing food, hygiene and household detergent packages, as well as sweet packs for children, blankets, new clothing and shoes.Back from helping out in Ladysmith and Newcastle this week, Allauddin Sayed, Gift of the Givers manager across five provinces, said that the conditions in KwaZulu-Natal were far more severe than those in Pretoria.Bridges collapsed\n\u201cHouses were literally washed away,\u201d he said, while bridges had collapsed, cutting communities off from the outside world, and roofs were blown off new brick homes.Sayed said one family he had visited in Ladysmith had lost a child to pneumonia\u2014aggravated by the wet and cold.Ester Ramogale, the function head for disaster management in the eastern region of Tshwane, said the effect of the flooding in Mamelodi was exacerbated by the growth of informal settlements.\u201cThe Mamelodi area is growing rapidly,\u201d Ramogale said. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly informal structures. [People] settle in areas where they have been advised not to build.\u201dRamogale said preventative measures included the distribution of flyers containing warnings to residents about living in low-lying areas. Awareness campaigns were carried out in winter and schools, particularly, were targeted.People tolerate such conditions, Ramogale said, because \u201cthey are waiting to be moved to RDP housing\u201d.Makua is bitter because, although she was given a deed for an RDP house in 2004, a councillor told her that the house does not exist. She still hopes her RDP house will materialise. \u201cThe councillor must make it happen,\u201d she says.The cooperative governance and traditional affairs department told the Mail & Guardian that it plays a role in various aspects of damage management by providing support to affected communities, working in cooperation with civil society bodies and providing funds for the rebuilding of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and houses.The South African Weather Service has warned of more heavy rains and possible flooding in several provinces at the weekend.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

According to environmentalists, the committee's recommendations were strong enough to protect the sensitive Western Ghat region.The committee had suggested that 140,000 kilometres of the Western Ghats be classified in three zones as per the requirement of environmental protection in the areas. In some areas the committee recommended strong restrictions on mining and quarrying, use of land for non-forest purposes, construction of high rises etc. The report was first submitted to the government in 2011.But the Kerala government rejected the committee report and did not adopt any of its recommendations.Speaking to various regional media, Madhav Gadgil has said that irresponsible environmental policy is to blame for the recent floods and landslides in Kerala. He also called it a \"manmade calamity\". He said that the committee report had recommended to protect the resources with the cooperation of local self governments and people, but those recommendations were rejected.

He isn\u2019t shirking from wading through muck-riddled waters and plucking those stranded in water-logged homes in his native district Thrissur in Central Kerala.When Gulf News tracked him over phone on Monday morning in his native hometown, he was on day four of rescue mission and was battling a nasty bout of fungal skin infection, triggered by him constantly being in water-logged streets. He\u2019s also one of the few stars who opened the doors of his family home in Irinjalakkuda and urged those trapped in floods to take temporary shelter there. His close friends and their families are currently camping down there.\u201cNow the situation is slightly OK. Rescue is almost over as we have managed to cart majority of the residents into relief camps. Now our next step is to rehabilitate them into their ravaged homes,\u201d said Thomas, who has been constantly uploading videos on their collective rescue mission.Since he was working on the grounds, he also highlighted the realities facing volunteers who were trying to help the flood survivors to safety.A recent video uploaded on his Facebook account saw him drenched to the bone, pleading with his neighbours in water-logged homes seeking refuge on their terraces. He explained that shifting to relief camps, no matter how rich and privileged your existence, is the most pragmatic solution during a natural disaster like the floods as help may not reach them once the volunteer leave.According to reports, around 22,000 people were rescued from flood-hit areas in Kerala on Sunday and more than 350 people have been killed in landslides triggered by monsoons.\u00a0Tovino chronicled his last week\u2019s trying experiences as his life\u2019s biggest lesson in humanity coming together to stay afloat.\u201cIt all started when I heard that water had flooded my friend\u2019s home. I went to pick them but then I realised how bad the situation is. This is my first experience of such intense rains. Even my father\u2019s generation had not witnessed such flood. So, we are just learning on the job \u2026 I am not alone in my efforts,\u201d said Thomas. He recounts how students from Christ College, who have their families in worst-hit areas such as Wayanad, are staying back magnanimously to help in rescue and relief efforts.According to the actor, who has played a variety of roles in hits such as ABCD and Ennum Ninte Moideen, the need of the hour now is financial help.\"What I am seeing is that we have rescued and put them in relief camps. The food is ok without any problem. What we need is that we need to rehabilitate them into their homes. Lot of people have lost their livelihoods. Many traders have lost their shops and those who lived livestock have lost their cows. This was their means of livelihood. To bring them back to normalcy isn\u2019t easy. Every malayali around the world and the non-malayalis need to just put in Rs1 [Dh 0.05] and it will still help.\u201dBut is there a silver lining in the face of such mass destruction by nature?\u201cKerala floods is a natural calamity but we have collectively stood together to overcome it. No matter what happens to us from now on, we will stand with our chests puffed and face it with strength. The bond between us all have strengthened. We are one big happy family.\u201dTovino Thomas, 29, was born in a Catholic family in Irinjalakkuda in Kerala. He is a former model who graduated from Tamil Nadu College of Engineering and is a qualified software engineer. However, the industry-outsider with no film dynasty backing him realised that his true calling is acting.He made his Malayalam film debut in 2012 with Prabhuvinte Makkal directed by Sajeevan Anthikad. But he could get his feet into the door after acting in a string of films such as Ennu Ninte Moideen, Charlie and ABCD. But the turning point in his career was Guppy in 2016. He topped up his career with hits including Godha and Oru Mexican Aparatha last year.But his biggest hit was the romantic drama, Mayaanadhi, which saw him play an endearing lover who\u2019s in love with an aspiring actress. It was a blockbuster that made him a household name. According to critics, his appeal stems from his friendly demeanour that makes him perfect for guy-next-door roles.He is married to his childhood sweetheart Lidiya and has a daughter.\u00a0Malayalam actress and fashion designer and TV Poornima Indrajith, who has been active in Kerala flood relief efforts, urged the Central government to declare the rain-ravaged calamity as a \u2018national disaster\u2019 to help the rain-ravaged state limp back to normalcy.\u201cKudos to the Kerala government and all the civilians who have managed to run things even without the Central government\u2019s support so far \u2026 But when it comes to grass-roots reality, we need their [Central Government]\u00a0 support,\u201d said Indrajith in an interview with Gulf News.For the past ten days, Poornima and her actor-husband Indrajith and two daughters have been camping at the Rajeev Gandhi Sports Centre (RSC) in Kochi, which has been transformed into a massive collection centre for relief items under the NGO, Anbodu Kochi.\u00a0\u201cWe weren\u2019t ready for such rains \u2026 it was like an attack because all of us were just expecting to celebrate Onam \u2026 When a natural calamity hits you, you may at first feel like you can overcome it. But this one has hit us so hard \u2026 it was like our carpet being pulled away from our feet,\u201d said Indrajith.\u00a0She isn\u2019t alone in helping rebuild Kerala after massive floods, which has claimed 350 people and forced its residents to seek refuge in temporary relief camps.\u00a0Singer- actor Vineeth Srinivasan said the need of the hour is to provide sanitation and food.\u201cAny contribution of the Gulf Malayalis to the CM\u2019s relief fund will be of great help to those who have been affected. Malayalis in the GCC can also guide them about the need to work on their insurance claims,\u201d said Sreenivasan.The Jimmiki Kamal composer Shaan Rahman dubbed the floods as the biggest disaster to have hit Kerala.\u201cPeople are slowly going back to their homes now.

But the toll would have been higher had the Keralites in the state not rallied around admirably to rescue hundreds of thousands of people stranded in their homes. Dams\u2019 sluice gates had to be opened as water levels rose to dangerous levels, adding to the woes wrought by 11 days of heavy rains.The Kerala diaspora too responded swiftly, dispatching funds and relief material to help their relatives, friends and strangers affected by the deluge. Almost all community organisations of Keralites in the UAE have set up centres around the emirates to collect relief material. Food, medicine, clothes, blankets and other aid material have been shipped to the state. The exchange houses too have weighed in by forgoing commission for payments remitted to the Kerala Chief Minister\u2019s Distress Relief Fund.The UAE leadership, in keeping with the spirit of giving, lent their support, urging citizens and expatriates to pitch in help the flood victims ahead of Eid Al Adha. President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan\u2019s move to set up a national emergency committee gave momentum to the UAE\u2019s emergency relief campaign in Kerala.The rising waters may have brought the state to its knees, but it failed to break the spirit of its people. Roads and bridges have been washed away. But fisherfolk and people from all walks of life have put themselves at risk to save the lives of others. Indian mainstream media have been accused of turning a blind eye to Kerala\u2019s suffering. But social media rose to the occasion. The networks have been filled with not just messages of support, but also offers of shelter and food to the flood-affected. In a state, where trolling is a favourite pastime, people have come together to harness the positive power of social media to help find the people stuck on rooftops and direct boats and helicopters to pluck them to safety.The people of Kerala have to be applauded for the way they pulled together to tide over the fury of the rain.

That is when Jaisal decided to bend down in the water and stay on all fours, letting the women step on his back and board the boat, one by one. One of the women did so, carrying her child.The social media was soon praising Jaisal\u2019s wholehearted service to the flood-hit and a few hundred thousand had watched the video within a few hours.Dozens of Kerala fishermen from Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam districts who rushed to help in the rescue operations following floods in the state, have won the praise of the state government, which has decided to compensate them, too.The fishermen had turned heroes on social media, too, for their commitment to the rescue operations. On hearing about the floods, the fishermen had loaded their boats into trucks and rushed to places like Ranni and Chengannur to help with the rescue efforts.They worked side by side with India\u2019s armed forces, taking their fishing boats through the by-lanes in towns and country-sides of Kerala, which had turned watery paths for them.Interestingly, many of the fishermen are themselves victims of the recent Ockhi cyclone which had devastated their own lives.While the social media gave them a big salute, state chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the fishermen would be provided free fuel for their boats and Rs 3,000 per day for their efforts in the rescue operations.The state government has also offered to compensate them for whatever damage their boats have suffered in the rescue work.

Second is not to send relief materials because everything is available in the state or in the neighbouring states,\u201d the envoy explained.As of now, enough supplies are there to handle the situation, he said.\"Receiving materials that are not required will create complications to the state government. It will cause unnecessary distraction, as the government has to devote their resources to store and sort out the goods for distribution, Suri said.Moreover, sending money will help rebuild the local economy, apart from providing emergency relief, he told Gulf News.\u201cIt is quite clear when you send cash, and people spend that cash by buying goods and services from the local economy, it will provide stimulus when things are slow. So it makes sense to send cash and spending that cash locally within Kerala so that it generates more jobs and economic growth,\u201d the diplomat said.As Gulf News reported on Monday, an Emirati official also said it was more important to send money to Kerala, so supplies could be bought from markets close to the flood-affected areas.Fahd Abdul Rahman Bin Sultan, deputy secretary-general for international aid affairs at Emirates Red Crescent (ERC), pointed out that it was more expensive, and logistically more complicated, to send relief martials by air \u2014 sometimes the cost of cargo is higher than the cost of the items being sent.The ambassador said there was no need to look at Kerala as an isolated place. Kerala is one of India\u2019s most developed states; it is certainly India\u2019s best-educated state. It is also surrounded by the reasonably well-developed states \u2014 Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The envoy explained that if there is a shortage in Kerala\u2019s Palakkad, Wayanad or Kannur districts, it could easily be sourced from major cities within around 50 miles, such as Coimbatore, Mysore and Mangalore.\u201cWhen you have big cities in the neighbourhood, there is no shortage of materials in India. Rather than going through the expense and efforts of collecting materials in the UAE, then finding ways to send them to Kerala\u2019s airports and then sending it from there, it makes sense to send money,\u201d the ambassador explained.It may be easy to send goods from the UAE to Kerala\u2019s airports but transporting them further from there will be a tough task because of damaged roads, he said.The envoy appreciated the initiative of major money exchange houses in the UAE to facilitate free-of-cost remittance to the Chief Minister\u2019s relief fund and urged everyone to utilise it.Suri said people\u2019s emotional urge to do something tangible during a crisis is understandable. \u201cCreating a box of items is more satisfying than wiring the money. But the fact is that wiring the money is far more efficient and rational.\u201dMoreover, other Indian states are also sending relief goods to Kerala, he said.\u25a0 Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has requested the Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) to extend their support to the state to deal with the worst natural calamity it has ever faced.\u00a0\u25a0 People can send their donations to CMDRF (Chief Minister\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund),\u00a0Account number: 67319948232,\u00a0State Bank of India, City Branch, Thiruvananthapuram,\u00a0IFS Code:\u00a0SBIN0070028.\u00a0Max - 36 \u00b0CMin - 28 \u00b0CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAETrump offers condolences to SaudisKerala flood: Kochi airport to open 'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Heavier than usual monsoon rains have submerged most parts of the state, which has issued alerts for many districts.The UAE community \u2014 the leadership, humanitarian organisations, government entities, residents, and businesses \u2014 has stepped forward to support the people of Kerala.If you are in the UAE, there are easy ways to donate for Kerala relief: (see the table below right)On Sunday, Bin Sultan said: \u201cAs you know, the order to support the people of Kerala has come from President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to all humanitarian organisations.

Our employees and volunteers are coordinating with the UAE consulate in Kerala and the government of Kerala. We have given directives to the consulate to buy food from the area there. We have collected items and we also have items already in stock.\u201dThe relief will be flow from the UAE to Kerala in a few days, Bin Sultan added, after the go-ahead from the UAE and Kerala, considering the weather and on-ground situation in Kerala. Also, an ERC delegation will be going to Kerala soon, he said.When asked about the total amount of funds and items for the Kerala relief effort, Bin Sultan said that the collection of funds and items is still an ongoing process.He added that the response from the UAE community has been strong, citing Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation (KBZF), which alone received Dh10 million, as an example.On Sunday, KBZF said the contributions started pouring in only hours after it launched an emergency relief campaign to assist the Kerala flood victims in line with the directives of the UAE leadership.ERC, established in 1983, is the leading humanitarian organisation of the UAE.Dubai\u00a0\u25a0 Kerala Muslim Cultural\u00a0 Committee (KMCC) office: Call 04-2727773\u00a0 to connect with volunteers at their offices in Al Baraha behind Dubai Hospital\u00a0\u25a0 Kerala NRI Cell and Indian Assist: Contact Chandra Prakash for Kerala NRI Cell on 0555653719 or on email : chandridxb@gmail.comSharjah\u00a0\u25a0 Indian Association Sharjah \u2014 06-5610845Abu Dhabi\u00a0\u25a0 The Indian Social and Cultural Centre (ISC) \u2014 02-6730066\u25a0 Indian Ladies Association (ILA) \u2014 02-6330182\u25a0 The Kerala Social Centre \u2014\u00a0 02-6314455\u00a0\u25a0 The Abu Dhabi Malayalee Samajam, Musaffah \u2014\u00a0 02-5537600\u25a0 The Indian Islamic Centre in Abu Dhabi \u2014 02-6424488Fujairah\u00a0\u25a0 Indian Social Club \u2014\u00a0 09-2221155\u00a0\u25a0 Bedsheets, sleeping mats, blankets, nighties, lungi, bathing towels, rusk (no bread), biscuits (no cream biscuits), water, rice, sugar, salt, milk powder, pulses, oil, spices, tea/coffee powder, electrolytes, water purifying chlorine, tablets, Dettol, first aid kits, mosquito repellents, anti-septic lotion, antifungal powder, bleaching powder/lime powder, baby diapers, adult diapers, sanitary napkins, toothpaste, toothbrushes, bathing soap, washing soap, candles, matchboxes, cooking utensils and dining utensils like plates, tumblers etc, basic household furniture (chairs, tables etc), containers for storing rice and other food items at home, footwear, mugs and buckets.\u25a0 Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has requested the Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) to extend their support to the state to deal with the worst natural calamity it has ever faced.\u00a0\u25a0 People can send their donations to CMDRF (Chief Minister\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund), Account number: 67319948232, State Bank of India, City Branch, Thiruvananthapuram, IFS Code: SBIN0070028.\u00a0div.success {padding:0 20px; background-color: #eff1e2; border-top: 6px solid#637a86; width=\"100%\"}\u25a0 Yousuf Ali, chairman and MD of LuLu Group, donated a total of Dh9.23 million.\u00a0\u25a0 Dr B.R.

IT\u2019S the secret plan senior public servants have drawn up that is causing fear and anger in Britain.The so-called Doomsday scenario has been devised by staff working for the Brexit Secretary David Davis - and it predicts Mad Max-style anarchy if the UK leaves the European Union next year without a deal in place.Medicine, food and fuel would become scarce within a fortnight according to the worst-case scenario, with a key port in Dover becoming unworkable on the first day of Brexit, leading to severe shortages across the country.That option is considered at the extreme limit of where Brexit could end, and it has caused considerable alarm among Brits who are already weary over the divorce process from the EU that is growing more complicated by the day.According to a report in The Sunday Times, chartered aircraft would have to be used to get supplies where they were needed.\u201cYou would have to medivac medicine into Britain, and at the end of week two we would be running out of petrol as well,\u201d the paper quoted a government source.\u201cIn the second scenario, not even the worst, the port of Dover will collapse on day one. The supermarkets in Cornwall and Scotland will run out of food within a couple of days, and hospitals will run out of medicines within two weeks,\u201d the Times reported.The plans were drawn up for ministers to read at special weekly meetings and were considered so damaging only a small number of Theresa May\u2019s government had seen them.The rest of the time the plans were \u201clocked in a safe\u201d, the source said.Brexit planners have denied the doomsday scenario would ever happen - at least officially - but conceded the discussions had taken place.Britain wants to strike a deal on future trade relations with the EU before it officially leaves the bloc on March 29 next year, but officials are also drawing up plans for negotiations ending without an agreement - which is where the doomsday and other scenarios come in.If it left without a deal it would trade on World Trade Organisation terms.The unknown factors are how EU countries would respond.The plans emerged as the Brexit negotiations reach a critical point and with a number of major obstacles blocking the way. Pro-Brexit supporters have accused those who favour staying in the EU of deliberately spreading fear. It also comes at a time Prime Minister May is under massive pressure to secure the best possible deal for Britain.It won\u2019t be easy - she is not only battling the EU and her counterparts in Europe, but members of her own party are growing restless and a minor party that keeps her in power has begun flexing its muscles.National newspapers have also called on her to stand aside if she cannot deliver a good Brexit outcome.One of the main issues complicating Brexit is the differences of opinion over whether a \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d Brexit should be pursued.A hard exit would see Britain able to sign its own free trade deals - and Australia is one of the countries it is interested in - but a soft exit would see the country form a customs partnership with the EU. One option is where the UK would act on the EU\u2019s behalf when goods arrived in the UK that are intended for the EU. The reverse would happen for goods arriving in the EU destined for the UK.That would seriously reduce Britain\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals - one of the key factors of Brexit, and it\u2019s not clear even if that is workable.A second option is known as maximum facilitation and aims to streamline the border process, using technology to remove physical customs checks.A big sticking point though is some of the systems could take years to implement.Then there is the problem of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK.Both sides want to keep the border open, but it\u2019s unclear how that is practical.The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, has warned that her party will withdraw its support for the May Government if Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK.She told Sky News: \u201cFor us, our only red line is that we are not treated any different from the rest of the United Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market which, of course, is Great Britain.\u201dA further flashpoint in the Brexit process is fast approaching. Cabinet ministers will meet soon to decide which customs option they should seek from the EU, and then Mrs May will meet EU leaders at the end of the month to update them on the plan.Before she even gets there though, the Prime Minister has to make it through a crucial vote in parliament when the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons.MPs are expected to vote on the bill next week, and Mrs May will hope that 15 amendments imposed by the unelected upper house will be defeated. If they aren\u2019t, and her government suffers a parliamentary defeat, then her own leadership could be under threat.As well as leaving the EU customs union and the Irish border question, also at stake is what power parliament has if the government\u2019s exit deal is rejected.Some commentators are already predicting the day of the vote will be the most dramatic in a generationAnd for someone who became Prime Minister as a direct result of Brexit, that truly would be doomsday scenario.The Doomsday Clock is a theoretical indicator of how close humanity is to a doomsday event. Started in 1947, the board of scientists who decide what the clock says has included Einstein, Oppenheimer and is now chaired by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss.andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

He\u2019s the only politician in history who posed while signing his own resignation letter, that tells you everything you need to know about him,\u201d deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said.Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, added: \u201cIt\u2019s always all about Boris Johnson with him.\u201dA scathing old tweet from Mr Johnson\u2019s former newspaper editor Max Hastings has also resurfaced.In his resignation letter, the one he is proudly pictured with, Mr Johnson accused Mrs May of surrendering to European Union negotiators as the UK plans to leave the bloc: \u201cWhat is even more disturbing is this is our opening bid...It is as though we are sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering above them.\u201dMr Johnson, a flamboyant former journalist and London Mayor, had taken issue with Mrs May\u2019s proposal for the UK to leave the EU next year.He feared it was a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit that betrayed the millions who voted to leave the EU and that would see the country still tied.She replied tersely that she was \u201csorry and a little surprised\u201d at his view considering he supported it just days earlier. She then added that it was \u201cright that you should step down\u201d.Mrs May has faced a backlash over her plan for the UK when the country leaves the EU in March next year.As well as Mr Johnson, Brexit Secretary David Davis quit her government and now there are calls for her to go as well.No leadership challenge has emerged yet, but several British media reports suggest backbenchers could be waiting until President Trump has visited this week to deliver their demands she resign.Mrs May has indicated she would fight any moves to blast her from Downing St.HARD BREXIT VS SOFT BREXIT: WHAT IT MEANSThe current crisis has been threatening to explode for months, as Mrs May has fought with colleagues within her Conservative party and Cabinet as well as EU counterparts to chart a course for Britain post-Brexit.Conservative politicians have been divided about what sort of Brexit to go for - a so called \u201csoft Brexit\u201d or a \u201chard Brexit\u201d.A hard Brexit is what is favoured by Brexit supporters. It would see the UK leave the single market and customs union when they leave the EU, meaning London would once again fully control its borders, stopping the flow of EU nationals, cut the money being sent to Brussels and mean the country could then negotiate its own trade deals.The customs union includes EU states and others, like Turkey, and does not require free movement of people, being directly subject to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or paying into the EU budget.The downside is British goods and services would face tariffs and sectors like agriculture could lose protections from cheap imports.A soft Brexit is that favoured by those who don\u2019t want the country to leave the EU, or at leastwant to retain some links. The UK would give up its seat on the European Council, but there could still be some sort of free movement of goods and services - and possibly people.THERESA MAY\u2019S PLANUnder Mrs May\u2019s plan, a \u201ccommon rule book\u201d would be maintained with the EU on industrial, agricultural and food goods. This \u201congoing harmonisation\u201d would ensure frictionless trade. Under the arrangement, goods coming into the UK would be charged the UK tariff, as opposed to the EU, and if the goods then were sent to EU states the EU tariff would be applied and the money paid to Brussels.Under this plan, common agricultural and fisheries arrangements would be left, but the UK would stay in the single market for foodstuffs.This could be a complicating factor in striking trade deals with other countries, such as Australia.This would then avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - where goods and people controlling flow freely without checks, but was in danger of ending under a hard Brexit.Her proposal means immigration would come under control with the free movement of labour ending. But - and this has alarmed Brexit supporters - there will be a mobility framework introduced in its place, and she has refused to rule out giving EU citizens preferential rights after Brexit.andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Speaker John Bercow said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which repeals the 1972 European Communities Act through which Britain became a member of the bloc, had been given the formal royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II.The bill transfers decades of European law onto British statute books, and also enshrines Brexit day in British law as March 29, 2019 at 11:00pm GMT.Prime Minister Theresa May said the approval was a \u201chistoric moment for our country, and a significant step towards delivering on the will of the British people\u201d, who had voted in a June 2016 referendum to exit the EU.The bill has undergone more than 250 hours of acrimonious debate in the Houses of Parliament since it was introduced in July 2017.Eurosceptics celebrated the passing of the bill through parliament last week as proof that, despite continuing uncertainty in the negotiations with Brussels, Brexit was happening.\u201cLest anyone is in any doubt, the chances of Britain not leaving the EU are now zero,\u201d International Trade Minister Liam Fox said.Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch Brexit supporter, said: \u201cThe legal position is now so much stronger for a clean Brexit.\u201cCrucially this makes the prime minister\u2019s negotiating hand much stronger.\u201d Another Eurosceptic, Conservative MP Dominic Raab, said May would go to an EU summit later this week \u201cwith the wind in her sails\u201d.The government had a tough time getting the bill through parliament and was forced to concede some power to politicians over the final Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.The Brexit ministry said in a statement the new law would ensure \u201ca smooth and orderly exit\u201d by giving the government temporary powers to make changes to legislation.The ministry said additional laws \u201cwill deliver the more significant policy changes needed as a result of our exit\u201d.Further battles are expected in the House of Commons in the coming weeks, when MPs debate two bills on trade \u2014 with pro-Europeans seeking to force the government to keep close ties with the bloc.May has yet to set out her plans for customs arrangements after Brexit, which have become a major stumbling block in talks with Brussels.She will gather her top ministers after the EU summit, which starts on Thursday, to thrash out their differences with the aim of publishing a Brexit blueprint shortly after.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

Will friends and family from either side of the border suddenly need a passport to visit?And perhaps the biggest question: If a border is imposed, will the bloody battle to reunite Ireland begin again?These questions are hanging over the head of British Prime Minister Theresa May.She has said that the legacy of Brexit will not be a hard border with the EU.But it is difficult to see how she can achieve this, as one of the biggest reasons British people chose to leave Europe was to take control of their borders, and not allow in people freely.If the UK is to honour that wish, they need to create a land border with the republic of Ireland.MORE: Northern Ireland's border is the key sticking point in Brexit negotiationsMORE: Brexit crisis as ministers abandon Theresa May Mrs May is stuck. She will now allow an exemption for Northern Ireland from Brexit. They have to leave Europe\u2019s shared customs union and single market.There\u2019s been talk of a \u2018soft border\u2019, but any talk of a border is worrying locals.They want to know how the UK government intends to protect the 1998 peace agreement and that\u2019s not yet been made clear.\u201cAt the end of the day a border is a border, whether it\u2019s soft or hard,\u201d Ms Strain said.\u201cThe whole peace process was to get rid of the border and get rid of the grudge between Northern Ireland and the south of Ireland.\u201cIt will just whip up all the troubles again. It definitely will. I know it will.\u201dHer concerns are shared by Northern Ireland\u2019s top police officer George Hamilton, who believes a fortified hard border will be seen as \u201cfair game\u201d by terrorist groups who think the peace process is a betrayal of Republican ideals.\u201cThe new IRA themselves have come out saying that \u2014 they have talked about Brexit being an opportunity for them,\u201d he said.There were five serious attempts by dissident Republicans to kill police last year, including one in Belfast in which two officers were wounded. Hamilton suspects there are more to come.\u201cA hard border from a policing perspective would not be a good outcome because it would create a focus and a target,\u201d he said.Tension has been growing since Britain voted in 2016 to exit the EU. London and Dublin have found themselves at odds, and faultlines are emerging between the largely Protestant Unionists, who want to preserve Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the UK, and the mostly Catholic Republicans, who want Northern Ireland to join the Republic.\u201cI was brought up to get along with the other side because my mum and dad lived in Northern Ireland so we had more chance of a Protestant being our next door neighbour,\u201d Ms Strain said.\u201cI have friends from the south of Ireland who only ever went to Irish school and have only ever associated with Irish people and they don\u2019t have time for the other side.\u201cIt is still very raw.\u201dMs Strain worries about her parents. They still live in the house she grew up in, on the edge of Newry, which is part of the UK, while her cousins \u2014 only a few minutes\u2019 drive away \u2014 live in the Irish Republic.\u201cWill we need a visa to visit them?\u201d she asked.\u201cThe police will be there and you\u2019ll have to show your passport and all you want to do it is go to the shops at the end of your street.\u201cThat is how surreal it is but that is what will happen.\u201dAmong people living along the border, the threat of Brexit is already affecting local livelihoods.Research has found people are being refused bank loans or won\u2019t apply to universities in the UK. Businesses have relocated to the other side of the border or are holding off on employing more people. Others have put new jobs on hold.Questions are being asked about how emergency services will cope and what will happen to children from Belfast who need surgery in the brand new purpose built facility in Dublin.\u201cPoliticians underestimate the political, psychological, emotional, social, cultural and economic significance of the border,\u201d says the report\u2019s author, political sociologist Katy Hayward from the Queen\u2019s University Belfast.She says the peace process is a \u201cfragile thing\u201d that can be easily undermined.Only last month, the border town known as Derry by Catholics and Londonderry by Protestants was gripped by six nights of street violence \u2014 the worst riots in Northern Ireland in years.Bricks, bottles and petrol bombs were thrown as police fired baton rounds to break up crowds. Children in poor Catholic neighbourhoods, some as young as eight, were being taught how to make petrol bombs and lob them at cop cars.Ms Strain says the dissidents are \u201cthe ones who don\u2019t want to give up\u201d.\u201cIf this border goes through, then this group will get bigger and the whole feud will start up again. Everyone thinks it.\u201dThere is little doubt that a hard border will be a visible, daily reminder of difference and politicians are playing a dangerous game in a place where frontiers and violence are inextricably linked.\u201cIt provides a barrier to goodwill, especially if there are issues of migrants,\u201d says Sydney University academic Luke Mansillo.But he believes any violence will \u201ctake time to develop\u201d and there are far more immediate consequences for the border, which currently notches up three million crossings a month.\u201cIt will be a trade issue impacting companies that do manufacturing within Ireland and other parts of the EU,\u201d he says.\u201cEighty per cent of trade going in and out of Northern Ireland would face some sort of control or tariff and we are already talking about an economically depressed area.\u201dYet a hard border is all but inevitable if Northern Ireland leaves the single market and after months of silence on the issue, locals fear the worst. They know from recent history that poor people who feel marginalised and sidelined are fertile ground for recruiting dissidents.\u201cI definitely, 100 per cent think that if that border goes up that the feud will go straight back up again,\u201d says Ms Strain.\u201cAnd if that happens then everyone should feel scared.\u201d\u2014 Tara Ravens has worked as a journalist for over 15 years, notably Australian Associated Press.News Pty Limited Copyright \u00a9 2018.

He promised audiences would hear about the way he saw the \u201cglobal revolution\u201d occurring and about the dangers of globalisation \u2014 which he believed was fuelling the big political upsets.The tour website describes him as the \u201cface\u201d of the Brexit campaign to leave the EU and someone who is frequently \u201cwidely consulted\u201d for his views on international political issues and populist revolts against the status quo.\u201c[The] fightback that is going on is a lot more fundamental than [just] short bursts of anger. The whole Western world is changing and reshaping.\u201dIf people thought it was over, they were wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s just beginning actually. It\u2019s just getting started.\u201dImmigration policy was at the heart of what he was talking about it. \u201cI\u2019m arguing against globalisation I\u2019m not saying to pull the drawbridge up but am arguing for the UK to control who comes over it.\u201dThe new Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini alarmed many EU leaders this month when he refused a boatload of migrants entry to Italy \u2014 a move Mr Farage praised and likened to Australia\u2019s policy on turning around migrant boats.\u201cI\u2019ve pointed to Australia again and again. But despite your geography [and isolation] global money can undermine your liberty. They did it to us, they will do it to you. Globalist money is the biggest threat to Australia.\u201dOpponents argued the nation state was archaic and \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong [in the] modern world\u201d. But it was here he believed Australia was at an advantage.\u201cI think in Australia your sense nationhood is more acute, possibly because you\u2019re somewhat younger and your radar is better than ours. But don\u2019t think [global forces] aren\u2019t any less insidious or dangerous, because they are.\u201dThe anti-Establishment Mr Farage urged Australians earlier this year to \u201ctake back\u201d their country and \u201cstand up and be counted\u201d.That would happen in an instant if politicians forgot who they were working for.\u201cIf people in Canberra start to represent themselves rather than the ordinary people then the revolution will come to Australia.\u201dMr Farage said Mr Salvini used to work for him and found it amusing that \u201call my mates\u201d were now coming to prominence.They were shunned and derided back then.\u201cAt one stage we were on the outer. In 2013 I was having dinner in Washington with a complete unknown, an eccentric guy called Jeff Sessions, who is now Attorney-General, Stephen Miller, who is a Donald Trump speechwriter, and Laura Ingraham who now hosts a major show on Fox. And there was I in this group and we were all fringe of the fringe.\u201dMr Farage wouldn\u2019t speak about Mr Trump, other than to confirm he was in close contact with the US President and would meet with him when he came to the United Kingdom.\u201cI think he needs to have people he can properly trust. And I\u2019m one of them.\u201dBy the time Mr Farage begins his Down Under tour, which also includes an event in New Zealand, Brexit will be closer to being reality.\u201cI\u2019m a bit schizophrenic about Brexit. Us leaving is everything I campaigned on and it\u2019s going to happen, but what is happening is we are going into negotiations in a lily-livered, weak way. It will mean we won\u2019t reap the benefits for years to come.\u201dBut a bad Brexit was still a good Brexit \u2014 and if he was driving the negotiations in Theresa May\u2019s place he would take a leaf out of his mate from the White House\u2019s book.\u201cI would do a Donald. It would be massively different and it would be all done and dusted [by now]. I would say to them where I wanted it to go, and be reasonable and willing to compromise, but everyone in business knows to get a good deal the other side needs to know [that] you\u2019re willing to walk out the door.\u201dDetails of Nigel Farage\u2019s Australian tour can be found at nigellive.com.au andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the EU of \u201cbehaving like the Mafia\u201d in their approach to Brexit negotiations during a plenary session of the EU Parliament on Wednesday, April 5. \u201cYou think we\u2019re a hostage,\u201d he told MEPs. \u201cWe\u2019re not, we\u2019re free to go.\u201d On being challenged by the Chair about his use of the word \u2018mafia\u2019 Farage said, \u201cI do understand national sensitivities, I\u2019ll change it to gangsters, alright?\u201d.

The truth of it is you wouldn\u2019t want to start from here.\u201dHe said through European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s policy in 2015 of \u201csaying anyone that wants to come can come\u201d, Europe had \u201cimported an awful lot of people who wish that civilisation harm\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very tough place,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do we go from here? Well number one is a massively increased security bill, a change in many ways to how we live. Look at London, we\u2019ve now built walls on our bridges to protect people walking over them.\u201dBut he said it was important to engage with the broader Muslim community. \u201cThere are some people who want to sort of go to war with the entire religion of Islam, and I\u2019ve always argued strongly against that,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m all for us defending our way of life, the only warning I give is that if we appear to be embarking on a religious war, that would be a mistake.\u201dFormer UK Foreign Secretary and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson sparked controversy last week by saying Muslim women wearing the full face veil looked like \u201cbank robbers\u201d and \u201cletter boxes\u201d.Mr Farage, who defended the comments, said it was encouraging that \u201ca lot of Muslim scholars and commentators have now put their heads up and said, this is not in Koranic law, it\u2019s not doing us any good\u201d.He said Australia had been \u201cslightly insulated by geography\u201d from the global political shift reflected in the election of Mr Trump and the rise of populist governments like Italy\u2019s Five Star-Northern League coalition.\u201cBut you\u2019re still very much part of the western world,\u201d he said.\u201cYour political class are tempted by the new global order, just as the Americans, British and the Europeans have been. I think the message really is number one, understand what\u2019s happened.\u201cUnderstand that Brexit, Trump and (Italian deputy leader Matteo) Salvini are not one-off flashes in the pan, they\u2019re actually part of a big, fundamental societal change that is taking place, and understand that those changes could happen in Australia, too.\u201cThe internet has given people terrific empowerment to make change if they feel the established order is not representing them. So I would say to Australia, don\u2019t think this can\u2019t happen to you, because it can.\u201dMr Farage said it was about whether people felt the political class in the capital cities were representing their \u201cthoughts, hopes and aspirations\u201d.\u201cWhat the change in the Australian voting pattern is suggesting is that there are people in Australia feeling the same thing too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mainstream can of course stop the rise of smaller parties, if they\u2019re more in tune and more connected with ordinary folks.\u201dThe Brexit vote \u201cwould not have happened without the immigration issue\u201d and there was a \u201cvery similar disconnect\u201d between the political class and the public in Australia on the topic, he said.Successive polls have revealed a growing unease with Australia\u2019s record high immigration intake. A survey last year by the Australian Population Research Institute found 74 per cent of voters said the country does not need more people.A Newspoll earlier this year revealed 56 per cent of voters believe the existing immigration cap of 190,000 a year is too high, and an Essential Media poll found 64 per cent believe the level of immigration over the past 10 years has been too high.In 2016-17, net overseas migration to the country came in at 262,500 people, 27.3 per cent higher than the previous year. Australia\u2019s population surged past the 25 million milestone at 11:01pm on August 7, sparking fresh calls to ease the strain on Sydney and Melbourne.\u201cI find it fascinating that even in a country like yours, which many of us up here hold in high regard because its points-based system and all the rest of it, that even there it\u2019s this disconnect,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019ve had your terrorist attacks, you\u2019ve had your problems that have occurred down there. People want to feel safer, they want to feel that the people coming into the country are going to pretty much absorb themselves within the existing culture.\u201dHe partly blamed the media for the growing discontent.\u201cPeople\u2019s faith in the mainstream media is collapsing \u2014 take CNN, since their non-stop, 18-month battle to get rid of President Trump, their ratings have fallen off a cliff,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople are voting with their feet when it comes to newspapers, radio and TV, and I think there is this perception that big business, big media, big politics, they\u2019re all in it together.\u201dAsked whether he had an opinion on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Farage said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to get drawn into individuals within Australian politics\u201d.\u201cAll I would say is that I was very disappointed during the referendum that so many Australian political figures seemed to argue that the UK should stay part of the European Union when clearly the freeing of the UK from the EU should be a very good thing for Australian and UK relations,\u201d he said.In the lead-up to the June 23, 2016 referendum, both Mr Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten said they would prefer the UK to stay part of the EU. After the Brexit vote, Mr Turnbull \u201cconsoled\u201d outgoing UK leader David Cameron.Former PM Tony Abbott bucked the conservative trend and supported the Remain side, but after the poll appeared to backflip, telling a London audience he was \u201cquietly thrilled that the British people have resolved to claim back their country\u201d.\u201cI found it extraordinary how all the global politicians, Australia included, got behind this, \u2018Let\u2019s keep the EU, let\u2019s keep the global order\u2019,\u201d Mr Farage said.\u201cBut it\u2019s happened, and whilst Mrs May is not doing the job very well, the prospects for our two nations with Brexit are much better than they\u2019ve been for decades.\u201dIt\u2019s generally thought the chances of a free-trade deal between Australia and the UK after March 29, 2019 would be better under a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d as opposed to a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d, in which the UK effectively remains a member of the EU in all but name.\u201cAn independent UK is able to choose its own friends,\u201d Mr Farage said.\u201cWe\u2019re able to strike our own trade deals, we\u2019re able to form our own relationships. I think for many of us who are big Commonwealth supporters, which I very much am, the last few decades have been very frustrating.\u201cWe\u2019ve watched the UK getting ever closer to the European political project to the detriment of our global relationships. I\u2019m optimistic, I think we can do trade deals together, there can be a new kind of renaissance, if you like, of the English-speaking peoples of the world.\u201dMr Farage would not reveal which politicians he planned to meet on his tour of Australia next month, where he will speak at a series of events billed as an \u201centertaining evening with Nigel Farage\u201d. He said we wanted to meet fisherman Rex Hunt and cricketer Dennis Lillee.\u201cThey\u2019re my great Australian heroes,\u201d he said.\u201cAll I can say at this stage is there are some quite senior Australian political figures that I will be meeting on my trip, but I can\u2019t disclose those names right at the moment,\u201d he said.\u201cBut clearly there are figures in Australian politics I do look up to from previous times. I thought John Howard was a remarkable man who I\u2019ve had the privilege to meet, but in terms of current day-to-day politics I want to be slightly careful.\u201dDetails of Nigel Farage\u2019s Australian tour can be found at nigellive.com.aufrank.chung@news.com.auQueensland senator Fraser Anning has called for a \u2018Muslim ban\u2019, with both sides of politics condemning the racist comments.\nTo join the conversation, please Log in.

It appealed to misguided \"British\" values Millions of Brits were attracted to the idea of homogenous England of old. Xenophobia is on the increase and Brexit did a great job of normalizing racism across Britain. \"There's a little Hitler in all of us\", wrote Andrew Sarris in 2002, \"if we are not held back by any moral or social restraints.\" Brexit made the normally pathological act of denouncing ethnicities and religions a normative one. Much of the campaign rested upon the idea of an imagined Britain of the final years of WWII when Churchill was a hero and Ghandi a terrorist. 2. They weren't wrong about the EUThe EU is a very clunky beast which was caused a huge amount of economic problems for countries such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland. It's a system of open markets in which competition is eviscerated in a shared currency. Britain has never taken on the Euro, and therefore managed a position of reasonable strength - but the Brexit mob isn't wrong about the unwieldly and regulated organ. 3. It was a revolt against prescriptive elitismJust like Donald Trump's populist movement across the United States, Brexit was a movement with a place for the everyman to stick it to the banks, the politicians, and the corporations who've been prescribing ideology to the masses. Like our own Flag Referendum, it was an opportunity for the country to collectively say \"get stuffed\" to the Government. 4. Leaving may curb immigration to BritainThere is an argument in England that Poles and Romanians have caused unemployment. For every able British person to do a job, there are 50 immigrants who will do it cheaper.This is an emotional argument which feeds into xenophobia but is a massive cornerstone of Brexit campaigning, especially from Nigel Farage. 5. Scaremongering from the British pressA number of very well-read British dailies have made no secret of their support for Brexit, meaning skewered facts and biased reporting may be diluting the facts about Britain leaving the EU. A recent article from the Daily Mail gave \"20 reasons why you should choose to leave.\" 6. It's made a mockery of David CameronThe British Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to hold referendum for leaving the EU to quell the unrest coming from Euroskeptics within his party. It has spectacularly backfired and heralded the resurgence of Nigel Farage. David Cameron is now grappling with a country in revolt, and Boris Johnson hasn't done him any favours by joining the bandwagon."}{"head": " Brexit is already changing daily life on Ireland's UK border  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " In the Brexit referendum campaign two years ago, Britain paid little attention to how exiting the European Union might affect the Irish border. Now, it's the single biggest issue in negotiations, as the two sides have failed to find a way to keep the EU's land frontier with the UK open. As the debate rages on, the chances of a messy divorce increase the risk that some kind of border posts will eventually have to go up. Many in the area are anxious about what lies ahead for business, daily life and even peace on the divided island. For others, Brexit has already changed their lives. Damian McGenity runs the post office in Jonesborough, a small village in Armagh, less than 1.5km from the Irish border. The part-time farmer now finds himself a part-time lobbyist for campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit. His life changed the moment the UK voted to leave the EU. \"I was out calving on the farm and I remember watching the result on the news late that night. I knew it was going to be close-then when it was declared I knew we were in serious trouble.\" Fellow farmers, neighbours and business owners from both sides of the border began to meet. \"We knew it was going to be a disaster for us, so we talked among ourselves about what we could do and that's when the group was set up,\" he said. The 45-year-old father of four has attended hundreds of meetings across Ireland and Europe. He's met Guy Verhofstadt and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier's team. \"Our objective is to educate Europe because we do not want a hard border. There are things we can agree on but the clock is ticking and I am really worried,\" he said. Father Joseph McVeigh , 72, is finding that Brexit is getting in the way of his priestly duties since he became a figurehead for the anti-Brexit movement in the Fermanagh-Cavan border region. The priest-who lives in the UK's most westerly constituency and the furthest from Westminster lawmakers-has been providing tours of the area's invisible border to press and tourists for the past two years. \"I have lived in Fermanagh for most of my life, I have seen bad times and experienced the great change that occurred with the Good Friday Agreement and the breaking down of the border following the so-called Troubles when people began to travel freely.\" \"When the decision to leave the EU was made, I along with many others got a shock. I realised that I had to get out and share my views with all traditions.\" \"Mass is a priority every day but this whole Brexit thing does take you away from other duties,\" says McVeigh, who has been a priest for 50 years. \"I want people outside Ireland to understand how we feel and how we think. I have spent many days and hours showing people from Germany, Italy, France and Switzerland what the border is like - it's usually a river or a bridge - and how absurd it is to have a border here at all.\" Fergal Quinn organises bachelor and bachelorette parties in Sligo in northwest Ireland, about 65km from the border. A year ago, speaking to Bloomberg, he was relaxed about Brexit, as the referendum result wasn't deterring the roughly 60 per cent of his customers who came from Northern Ireland, spending the day painting nudes or jumping off cliffs before heading to the nightclub he runs with his brother. Now, the Quinns are noticing a difference at the five venues they run, as numbers from Northern Ireland drop by about 20 per cent, a move he mostly links to sterling's tumble. Just before the referendum, a pound bought more than 1.30 euros. Now, it's about 1.12 euros. Against that backdrop, Quinn is targeting the Irish Republic market. His biggest worry is the possibility of a hard border, with checkpoints and delays. \"That would be a game changer,\" he said. \"It would really hurt us.\" Ian Marshall, 50, is a Protestant and unionist who \"strongly\" believes Northern Ireland should remain within the United Kingdom. Now, thanks to Brexit, he finds himself catapulted into the upper house of the Irish Parliament in Dublin. Anti-Brexit and a former leader of the Ulster Farmers' Union, the father of three was nominated to become a member of Ireland's Senate by Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who wanted a Northern Irish unionist perspective. \"I was completely taken aback,\" Marshall said. \"I had to make sure I wasn't a pawn in a political game, that there was no ulterior motive.\" \"Everyday, I ask myself how did I get here? But this is so important - the Brexit collateral damage could be horrendous. The politicians who want this will be long gone, but our kids will be living with the consequences for 30 or 40 years.\" Kevin Woods has run the Shalom guest house for over 30 years with his wife Jackie. The 74-year-old lives on Carlingford Lough where the border runs through the vast sea inlet. \"For 30 years of the Troubles, a British gunship sat out there on the lough in front of our house. They will never return, it will never happen. If a customs border ended up here I think in the last few years of my life I'd be tempted to blow it up myself.\" Woods also has another interest: leprechauns. He calls himself the last leprechaun whisperer in Ireland, and runs the Last Leprechauns of Ireland websites, running one-hour tours including a visit to a cavern, where he regales children and adults with stories. They way he tells it, the leprechauns sprint down a tunnel under the Lough on the south and meet with northern spirits. For Woods, Brexit is leading to reunification, and not just among the leprechauns. \"There will be a united Ireland, it will come. I won't make it, but others will.\" - Bloomberg"}{"head": " How Brexit will hit your back pocket  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " KiwiSaver Your KiwiSaver balance may be looking worse for wear after the market carnage sparked by Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union. Around US$2 trillion was erased from the value of global sharemarkets on Friday. Roughly $2.8 billion was wiped off New Zealand's stock exchange alone. Most KiwiSaver funds hold shares, and riskier, more growth-focused options generally invest more heavily in stocks. Bond and currency markets have also been shaken up by the volatility caused by the result. Sharemarkets, including New Zealand's, are likely to fall again tomorrow and uncertainty stemming from Brexit, including the potential for other European nations to leave the union, could stoke volatility in markets even for years. But stocks could recover later in the week as investors realise Brexit is not the end of the world. Canny traders will take advantage of the upheaval and view it as a buying opportunity. Travel That mid-winter jaunt to the UK suddenly became cheaper after Britain's currency fell through the floor on Friday. The New Zealand dollar was buying 52p yesterday, up from 48.5p on Thursday, the best exchange rate in almost three years. The kiwi made a modest gain against the euro to be trading at around 64c, but fell sharply against the US dollar from US73c Friday morning to US70.8c yesterday. A currency exchange chain reported record numbers of people through their doors, and travel agents saw an increase in queries into holidays to the UK and Europe. But Britain has been left a deeply divided nation by the Brexit referendum and there is potential for social unrest, which could put a dampener on your holiday. Mortgages/house prices Interest rates are expected to stay lower for longer as the global economy and financial markets absorb the impact of the Brexit shock. Mark Lister, of Craigs Investment Partners, said the Reserve Bank could cut the official cash rate below 2 per cent from 2.25 per cent. \"There's a good chance that they cut now in August and cut more aggressively,\" Lister said. Lower rates could pour fire on an already heated property market, an outcome the Reserve Bank will be keen to avoid as it juggles conflicting economic pressures - namely rising house prices, stubbornly low inflation and a strong kiwi dollar. However, Lister said heightened volatility in financial markets may increase banks' funding costs. That could mean mortgage rates don't go lower even if the OCR is cut, he said. Migration There have been suggestions that Britain may ease immigration restrictions facing New Zealanders if it leaves the EU. But Prime Minister John Key poured cold water on those claims in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. \"As part of the driving motivation of the leave camp is about migration, it is hard to see them then, if they do leave, all of a sudden having a very welcoming policy on migration [from New Zealand],\" Key said. \"I don't think [access] would be greatly enhanced.\" The Brexit vote is bad news for New Zealanders who hold British passports and have enjoyed being able to live and work freely in the EU. That looks likely to change. It remains to be seen whether Britain leaving the EU will result in large numbers of Britons deciding to up sticks and migrate to other countries, including New Zealand. Trade Although Britain isn't the crucial export market it once was, it still received $3.1 billion in New Zealand goods and services in the year to September 2015. ExportNZ reckons much work by Kiwi trade negotiators will be required to deal with the post-Brexit landscape. Its executive director, Catherine Beard, said New Zealand's trade arrangements would be affected if new trade deals needed to be struck between the EU and Britain. For example, meat export deals may need to be renegotiated. \"Our goods exports to Europe are already highly tariffed and New Zealand exporters are hopeful of changing this with a NZ-EU free trade agreement as soon as possible. Britain's exit from the EU could slow this process down.\" Brexit could also affect this country's tourism industry as Britain is the fourth biggest source of tourists for the sector. The steep drop in the pound's value will make travelling overseas more expensive for Britons. \u2022 In a historic referendum Britain voted to leave the European Union after 43 years. \u2022 Prime Minister David Cameron, who supported remaining in the EU, resigned shortly after the result. He will step down by October. \u2022 World markets reacted to the shock outcome and roughly US$2 trillion was wiped off global stocks. \u2022 Britain's pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985. \u2022 Quitting the EU is not an automatic process and negotiations with the remaining 27 countries are expected to take at least two years. \u2022 A volatile week of trading is expected when the markets reopen tomorrow. \u2022 David Cameron will head to Brussels this week for the European Council summit.

Banks had just scored a huge win. From relative obscurity, he had become the largest political donor in British history by pouring millions into Brexit, the campaign to disentangle the United Kingdom from the European Union that earned a jaw-dropping victory at the polls two months earlier. Now he had something else that bolstered his standing as he sat down with his new Russian friend, Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko: his team's deepening ties to Donald Trump's insurgent presidential bid in the United States. A major Brexit supporter, Steve Bannon, had just been installed as chief executive officer of Trump's campaign. And Banks and his fellow Brexiteers had been invited to attend a fundraiser with Trump in Mississippi. Less than a week after the meeting with the Russian envoy, Banks and firebrand Brexit politician Nigel Farage - by then a cult hero among some anti-establishment Trump supporters - were huddling privately with the Republican nominee in Jackson, Mississippi, where Farage wowed a foot-stomping crowd at a Trump rally. Banks' journey from a lavish meal with a Russian diplomat in London to the raucous heart of Trump country was part of an unusual intercontinental charm offensive by the wealthy British donor and his associates, a hard-partying lot who dubbed themselves the \"Bad Boys of Brexit.\" Their efforts to simultaneously cultivate ties to Russian officials and Trump's campaign have captured the interest of investigators in the United Kingdom and the United States, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Both inquiries center on questions of Russia's involvement in seismic political events that have shaken the world order, with the European Union losing a key member and U.S. voters electing a president critical of Washington's traditional alliances. In the UK, recent revelations about Banks' Russian contacts have triggered scrutiny of whether the Russians sought to bolster the Brexit effort. In the US, congressional Democrats who recently obtained a trove of Banks' communications have begun exploring a different question: Did the Brexit leaders serve as a conduit between the Kremlin and Trump's operation? Banks rejected the notion that he was a go-between, insisting his contacts were routine business and diplomatic exchanges - and that the investigations are a \"witch hunt.\" But he acknowledged that the interactions raised reasonable questions about whether the Brexiteers were \"a back channel to the Russians,\" as he put it. \"The only problem with all of that is that not one shred of evidence has been produced. . . . It doesn't go anywhere,\" Banks said in one of two interviews with The Washington Post in Bristol, England, this week. Asked whether Russians had been probing them or seeking to win influence or intelligence, Banks conceded, \"They may have. But if so, it wasn't a very good probe.\" Throughout the 2016 campaign, the wealthy insurance executive built a first-name rapport with the Russian ambassador as Banks briefed him on the breakaway campaign - exchanging frequent, chummy texts and emails and meeting with him in person four times in about 12 months, according to Banks. At the same time, he and other Brexit backers also intently pursued entree to Trump's world, according to interviews and dozens of emails and text messages Banks provided to The Post. As both relationships deepened, Banks and his associates discussed Trump's bid and the US presidential campaign with Yakovenko, the Brexit backers acknowledge. At least two of the meetings between Banks and the ambassador came shortly before or after meetings with Trump. In recent weeks, British parliamentary investigators have sought information about Banks' relationship to Russia and allegations that he was offered financial inducements, including a potentially lucrative gold-mine deal with a Russian businessman he met through the Russian ambassador. The interactions between the Brexit leaders and the Trump campaign have also drawn the interest of Mueller as part of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign, which is examining contacts between Trump associates and Russians. Two people - former Trump communications official Michael Caputo and another person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation - told The Postthat Mueller's investigators asked about Farage's relationship to Trump associates in witness interviews this year, including Caputo just last month. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats are examining the role of the Brexit leaders after a whistleblower gave a cache of documents detailing Banks' interactions with the Russian ambassador to members of the House Intelligence Committee earlier this month, according to three lawmakers on the panel. US Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, the ranking member of the committee, said he has questions about whether Banks and his associates \"served as a conduit of information to and from the Russians on behalf of the Trump campaign.\" Another committee member, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said the material \"opens a whole new chapter\" in the ongoing inquiry into Russian efforts to intervene in the 2016 US election. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Bannon, who led Trump's campaign in the final months of the 2016 race, declined to comment. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said he was not aware of any questions from Mueller about the Brexit backers and had seen nothing about the topic in documents he has reviewed. \"I never heard anything about the Russian ambassador [to the UK] nor have I ever talked to the president about this,\" he said. Farage and Banks said they have not been contacted by Mueller's investigators and disputed the idea that they ferried information for the Trump campaign or the Kremlin. \"There seems to be a culture of throwing hysterical accusations around without any evidence whatsoever,\" Farage said in an email response to questions. Banks said he and his fellow Brexit leaders have sought to be transparent about their dealings with Russia. Shortly after Trump's election, he said, they reached out to officials from the US Embassy in London in the wake of a report suggesting they were pro-Russian actors. Banks said he and Farage each met once with American embassy officials to describe their contacts. Their associate Andrew Wigmore said he sat down with US diplomats five or six times and turned over numerous documents. A spokesperson for the US Embassy in London confirmed that leaders of the Brexit movement met with American diplomats, including Thomas William, a top political officer at the State Department, but declined to discuss the subject of the meeting. Banks said he was releasing documents to The Post to show he has nothing to hide, and he said he would be happy to speak to Mueller. \"We had so much fun at a parliamentary select committee,\" he said, referring to his recent appearance before British lawmakers. \"We'd love to be called in.\" The connections between the men who would become the Bad Boys of Brexit and Trump's future inner campaign circle stretch back to 2013, when Farage said he first met Bannon - then at the helm of the far-right website Breitbart. The conservative media executive quickly bonded with the populist politician, who at the time was leading the UK Independence Party, an anti-immigrant, make-Britain-great-again force that helped fuel a backlash against the European Union. Soon, the Brexit leaders also began to forge Russian ties. In the fall of 2015, during UKIP'sannual convention at the Doncaster racecourse several hours north of London, Wigmore, a Farage confidant, met a Russian diplomat named Alexander Udod, who then helped arrange a lunch for the UKIP leaders with the Russian ambassador, Yakovenko. (Udod was one of 23 suspected Russian intelligence officers ejected from Britain this year after the nerve agent attack against Sergei Skripal, a Russian double agent, and his adult daughter, in Salisbury in south England.) Banks and Wigmore said they were interested not only in briefing the Russians on Brexit, but also in seeking possible Russian backers for their various offshore investments, including banana plantations in Belize. In November 2015, the two men had what they describe as a \"6-hour boozy lunch\" at Yakovenko's fashionable residence in London. The two men briefed the ambassador on their Brexit plans, but Yakovenko seemed most interested in hearing stories about Wigmore's father, who had been involved in one of the last UK-Russia spy swaps, Banks said. Over tea at the ambassador's house a few days later,Yakovenko introduced Banks to a Russian businessman, who pitched him on a potentially lucrative merger of six gold mines. Banks passed on the opportunity, he said, months before the Brexit vote was scheduled. \"I'm a businessman. . . . Why wouldn't I?\" Banks said of his willingness to consider the deal, saying it had nothing to do with Brexit or Trump. Reports in The Times of London, The Guardian and its Sunday paper, The Observer, about the proposed gold-mine deal and some of the correspondence between the Brexit backers and the Russians have prompted questions in the UK about whether the proposal might have been a way to route Russian money into the Brexit campaign or compromise its backers. Wigmore, who also served in a diplomatic post with the High Commission of Belize in London, said his main goal at the lunch was not to talk about Brexit, but to help find a buyer for a large Belizean banana plantation whose owner had been designated as a drug kingpin, effectively preventing the farming operation from major international markets. \"In hindsight,\" Wigmore said, \"it looks more ridiculous than it actually sounds.\" The Russian embassy in London did not respond to requests for comment, but it has denied that it had any involvement in Brexit. \"The Russian embassy has not in any way intervened in the domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum,\" the embassy told The Observer. \"Meeting stakeholders representing all political spectrum of the host country is a natural element of the work of any embassy.\" After their initial encounters, the Brexiteers were quickly on a first-name basis with the ambassador. \"Dear Alexander,\" Banks wrote in a text message the day after their lunch. \"Firstly many thanks for the hospitality. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Beautiful wine and food.\" He went on to invite the ambassador to his \"Old Down\" manor home in the countryside, a sprawling estate and country park with gorgeous views and llamas. Banks said the visit never took place. \"At the time, the Russians weren't considered the baddies at all,\" Wigmore said. \"In London, everyone was engaging with the Russians.\" Indeed, in the months to come, George Papadopoulos - one of then-candidate Trump's volunteer foreign policy advisers who is now cooperating with Mueller's probe - also sought a meeting with Yakovenko. In March 2016, according to emails and US court records, Papadopoulos unsuccessfully worked to land an introduction to the Russian ambassador through a London-based professor and other Russian contacts. Around that time, Farage's movement suffered a blow in the UK, losing a competition to be the official government-financed campaign urging people to vote to leave the EU. So he and his allies struck out on their own, funded by Banks, an insurance and mining magnate. He ended up putting 9 million British pounds into the campaign, Banks said. The effort was boosted by enthusiastic support from Bannon's Breitbart, which by then had launched a UK edition and was promoting Farage and the long-shot Brexit initiative with vigor. On June 23, 2016, the Brexit forces eked out a victory. Suddenly, Farage was an international celebrity. The following month, Farage - who had stepped down from his UKIP leadership post - and his associates attended the Republican National Convention. There, they were greeted as conquering heroes and began to make inroads into Trump's campaign. One night during the convention, Farage was introduced to Trump's longtime adviser, the infamous political trickster, Roger Stone, at an Italian restaurant in The Flats district of Cleveland, according to both men. Stone, who was accompanied that night by the Internet radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, said Farage's main goal appeared to be to get a meeting with Trump. The next day, Stone said, he tried to help by calling his former business partner, Paul Manafort - then Trump's campaign chairman- and suggested that the Republican nominee get together with Farage. Manafort's response was something along the lines of, \"I'll put a good word in,\" Stone recalled. It was another encounter, however, that would get Farage and his allies the Trump meeting they wanted. On the last night of the convention, Wigmore and Farage wandered into the bar at the Hilton Hotel, where they ran into a rowdy group of staffers for Mississippi Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. \"They were incredibly drunk. And the assistant to the governor said, 'Look, if we invite you to Mississippi, would you come?' \" Wigmore recalled in an interview. \"Of course, we said, 'Yes, of course,' not thinking it would be followed up. But it was.\" In an emailed statement, Bryant said: \"I admired the Brexit movement from afar two years ago. I believe the same principles that drove Brexit contributed to President Trump being elected. Both events restored hope to the forgotten men and women.\" The Brexiteers returned to London upbeat about the prospects of more closely aligning their movement with Trump's. Less than a month later, their ties to his operation were further cemented when Farage's biggest American booster - Bannon - was installed at the helm of Trump's campaign. Two days after the Bannon announcement, Wigmore and Banks lunched with the Russian ambassador and discussed Trump's prospects and their upcoming trip to Mississippi. \"We had no idea that we would meet [Trump], but I'm sure we would have told the Ambassador we were going,\" Wigmore said in an email to The Post. \"I do remember him stating that he did not think [Trump] had a chance of winning and you may remember at the time Trump was 10 points down in the polls and the attacks on him were full on.\" Less than a week later, in Mississippi, Wigmore said Farage met Trump for the first time at a high-dollar fundraiser for the GOP campaign in Jackson. Afterward, Trump invited the Brexiteers to a campaign rally and asked Farage to speak on stage. \"Trump says, 'I'll come on stage, I'll speak for a few minutes, then I'll introduce you. You speak for six minutes, and then I'll carry on. Are you OK with that?' \" Wigmore recalled. Soon, Farage had the hyped-up crowd on its feet. \"If I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me. In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if SHE paid me,\" Farage told an audience that roared its approval. \"Folks, the message is clear, the parallels are there. . . . Remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.\" From then on, Farage and his cohorts became almost de-facto Trump campaign surrogates. They attended presidential debates in St. Louis and Las Vegas and a rally in Michigan. When the campaign was rocked by The Washington Post's report on a videotape in which Trump bragged about groping women, Farage went on Fox News to defend him. \"He's not running to be Pope,\" Farage declared. On Nov. 12, 2016 - four days after Trump was elected president - Farage and his colleagues decided on a whim to pay a visit to Trump Tower in New York. They arrived at the building without an appointment or an invitation, Wigmore said, and Farage called his pal Bannon, who responded: \"Yeah, obviously, come along and see me.\" The whole retinue of Brits ended up in a lengthy meeting with the president-elect, whom Banks described as \"very un-Trump-like\" that day, \"very relaxed, open-neck shirt . . . very reflective.\" \"He wanted to talk to Nigel about what it felt like when he finished the Brexit campaign, and it was a very mellow kind of conversation,\" Banks said. Eventually, Farage - the first foreign visitor hosted by the president-elect - would take a now famous photo with a smiling Trump, Banks and Wigmore in front of the building's gilded elevator. During their visit, the Brexiteers got a glimpse of Trump's chaotic operation, listening with amusement as harried staffers argued over who should be named White House chief of staff, Banks said. At one point, Wigmore said, a secretary standing outside the office blurted out: \"You're British. Do you have a number for Number 10?\" - a reference to the British prime minister's home at 10 Downing Street. In fact, Banks did. But he wanted something in return, and Trump's staff was happy to oblige: a good telephone number for Trump's presidential transition office. A few days later, after Banks had returned to London, he and Wigmore sat down again for tea with Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador - their fourth meeting in a year. The Russians \"were utterly gobsmacked that Trump had won,\" Banks said. Wigmore had been handing out the Trump transition team's telephone number to all sorts of diplomats from various countries, he said. So when the Russian ambassador asked for the number, he said he happily obliged. Wigmore said he was \"not thinking there was anything remotely sinister\" in sharing information he had learned at Trump Tower with the Russian diplomat. \"Why would I?\" - The Washington Post's Booth reported from Bristol, England, and London.

But the ballot won't say anything about what should replace EU membership. That will be up to negotiators - representing Britain on one side and the governments of the 27 other EU member nations on the other - who will spend the next two years hammering out the terms of divorce if Britain votes to leave. Pro-Brexit campaigners have said that Britain will continue to swap goods and services with EU nations; those imports and exports now make up about half the country's trade volume. Brexit advocates also say that Britain will be free from stultifying Brussels bureaucracy once it leaves the EU. But how will that actually work? And what are the chances that Britain's post-Brexit reality will match the rhetoric of those advocating for \"out\"? Those arguing for \"in\" say Brexit would be a leap in the dark, with leading economists warning of dire consequences. A post-Brexit Britain would have a number of different models to choose from based on the experiences of other countries that exist outside the EU but still do business with the bloc. Here are four options, with the pros and cons for each. 1 Norway/Iceland/LichtensteinPros: In many ways, this would be the least disruptive option. Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein are members of the European Economic Area, a body that gives countries access to the European common market as long as they agree to play by the EU's rules, with certain exceptions for areas such as agriculture and fisheries. The agreement's rules automatically adapt as the EU changes, so there's no need for constant renegotiation. All three countries have had economic success under the EEA. Cons: If Britain is opting to leave the EU to regain its sovereignty, this is not the way to do it. Countries may be technically outside the EU but in reality are still beholden to Brussels. And they don't get a formal say in EU decision-making. EEA members must accept basic EU principles, including the free movement of workers. That means the primary driver of the Brexit campaign - concerns about immigration - would remain unaddressed. 2 SwitzerlandPros: The Swiss model is similar to the EEA in that the Swiss get EU access in exchange for abiding by EU rules. But the Swiss get more flexibility, with bilateral agreements that allow them to pick and choose which areas of the union's many realms they want to participate in - and which rules they want to follow. In 2014, for instance, Swiss voters opted to impose limits on immigration from within the EU, something that full EU members can't do without violating the body's charter. Cons: Switzerland's a la carte approach is a recipe for constant negotiation. Even though voters had their say on immigration two years ago, for instance, Swiss and EU authorities have still not come to terms on how restrictions on newcomers will translate in practice. The Swiss model is so burdensome for Brussels that EU authorities say they will never allow Britain the option, lest the EU become a pick-and-choose union. Like those in the EEA, the Swiss get no formal input on the making of most EU rules. Their agreements also exclude trade in services - a huge part of the UK economy. 3 CanadaPros: If models within Europe don't suffice, Britain could look across the Atlantic to Canada. The United States' neighbour to the north has negotiated a free-trade deal with the EU that is due to take effect this year and will eliminate nearly all tariffs on goods. Former London Mayor Boris Johnson has championed the Canada model, colourfully exhorting his fellow Brits to \"hold our nerve and not be cowed by the gloomadon poppers\". Johnson says Canada proves that it's possible to trade with Europe while also controlling national borders. Cons: The Canadian deal took five years to negotiate, and a British deal would doubtless be even more complex because of the country's web of interconnectedness with continental Europe. Canada's deal also largely leaves out services; Britain's financial industry would take a big hit if the same were true for a UK-EU deal. The British Treasury has estimated that the Canada model would cost every Brit about US$2500 in lost gross domestic product as the UK economy contracts. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that Johnson's depiction of the Canadian model is \"too good to be true.\" 4 World Trade OrganisationPros: If all else fails, Britain would default to World Trade Organisation rules for trade with EU members. The global body, with 162 members, sets a limit on how high the trade barriers can be between any two nations. The WTO option means there would be no requirement that Britain bow to rules written in Brussels. Leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage has pointed out that WTO tariffs have fallen substantially in recent years. And as he said while squaring off against Cameron, \"No deal is better than the rotten deal we have got at the moment\". Cons: No deal could actually be quite a bit worse than the status quo. The British Treasury has estimated that the country's economy would be 7.5 per cent smaller by 2030 in the event of the WTO option, because of higher tariffs and restricted market access. And even this, the most straightforward of all options, could require marathon negotiations stretching on for years, according to the WTO's chief. Britons could also lose their rights to live, work and study in continental Europe without a deal to allow Europeans to do the same in Britain."}{"head": " Timeline of events leading up to Brexit  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " LONDON (AP) \" A timeline of key events related to Britain's decision to leave the European Union: Jan. 23, 2013: British Prime Minister David Cameron promises a referendum on Britain's membership to the EU if the Conservative party is elected in the next general election. He does so to try to garner support among euro-skeptics within his own party. Sept. 18, 2014: Scottish voters decide in a referendum to remain part of the United Kingdom rather than become an independent country. May. 7, 2015: British voters elect a majority Conservative government. Cameron confirms in his victory speech that there will be an in/out referendum on European Union membership. Feb. 20, 2016: Cameron announces that he has negotiated a deal with EU leaders which will give Britain \"special status.\" He confirms that he will campaign for Britain to remain in the 28-nation bloc. The referendum date is set for June. Feb. 21: Cameron is struck with a severe blow as one of his closest Conservative allies, the media-savvy Boris Johnson, joins the Leave campaign. June 16: One week before the referendum, Labor MP and Remain campaigner Jo Cox is killed by extremist Thomas Mair who shouted \"Britain First\" before killing the mother of two. June 23: Britain votes 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the European Union. As the results come in, UKIP leader Nigel Farage proclaims that this day should be considered Britain's \"independence day.\" June 24: Cameron says he will resign in light of the results because Britain needs \"fresh leadership\" to take the country in a new direction. July 11: Following a heated leadership contest, Home Secretary Theresa May becomes prime minister-elect when her competitors withdraw from the race. Oct. 2: May says that Britain will begin the formal process of leaving the EU by the end of March 2017. In order to do this the British government would have to invoke Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. Jan. 24, 2017: The British Supreme Court rules that parliamentary approval is needed before Article 50 can be triggered by government. March 13: Britain's Parliament approves a bill giving the government the authority to invoke Article 50. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she plans to have a second referendum on Scottish independence in late 2018 or early 2019.

Plans have been drawn to use helicopters and army trucks to take supplies to vulnerable people outside the south east who might need medicine, according to The Sunday Times. The startling revelations will provoke fresh claims from Brexiteers that the government is scaremongering over a \"no deal\" Brexit, the Daily Mail reported. Supermarkets have also warned suppliers to start stockpiling fuel, food and medicine A Ministry of Defence source acknowledged that there was \"a blueprint for us supporting the civilian authorities\" but said they had received \"no formal request\" to supply aid. Ministers have repeatedly played down the risk of shortages in the event of a sudden hard Brexit next March. There are fears a no deal Brexit could stop imports of food and other supplies, such as medicine, to Britain. Last week Brexit secretary Dominic Raab insisted there would be adequate food supplies. Asked whether the Government was considering stockpiling food to cope with a \"no deal\" Brexit, Raab said: \"It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing stockpiling. \"What we will make sure - and of course the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate - but we will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there is adequate food supply.\" In an interview with 5 News on Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not deny stockpiling is happening. But she insisted the Government is being \"responsible and sensible\" while still trying to get a good deal with the European Union. May said: \"Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but... because we don't know what the outcome is going to be... let's prepare for every eventuality.\" Supermarkets have started asking suppliers to begin planning for a \"no deal\" Brexit. Fears have been mounting the UK is set to crash out of the EU in March, with concerns for supplies of food and medicine. German supermarket Aldi has now emailed suppliers saying it wanted to work with them \"to help understand the potential implications\", according to The Sunday Times A spreadsheet was attached to the email showing a breakdown of ingredients and packaging materials, that are all sourced for the EU. A supplier of coffee to Aldi, Giles Hurley, said he was thinking of storing six to eight weeks stock. He said: \"Most of the major retailers have been asking their suppliers how are planning for the implications of Brexit- and especially how we are planning to ensure we do not out of the goods we bring in from the EU. \"They can easily sit back and say they have no plans or concerns because, as usual in this relationship, it will be the suppliers who make the plans.\" But one chairman of a big grocer said \"we're some way off no deal and tariffs being imposed and queues at Dover\"."}{"head": " How Brexit could affect Game of Thrones  ", "classes": ["element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph", "element", "element-paragraph"], "content": " The Brexit vote could have disastrous repercussions for HBO's fantasy epic Game of Thrones and other big budget productions. While it might appear that the cult show has little to do with the EU referendum, the exit vote will make it harder and more expensive to make shows like GoT. That's because when the UK leaves the EU, it will take Northern Ireland - one of the show's principal filming locations - with it. The average Game of Thrones episode costs $US6 million to make. That's two to three times what a typical network or cable show costs per episode. HBO gets a significant grant from the EU's European Regional Development Fund, which was created to spur economic growth across the European Union, to make the series. When Britain leaves, filmmakers might not be eligible to draw from that fund. This means that some of the cash used to bring big-budget productions to Northern Ireland could disappear. Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States' Brussels office told Foreign Policy filmmakers should be concerned. \"It might be up in the air for US studios who want to film in the UK,\" Mr Chase said. \"There are EU programs to help fund all of this. If the UK is no longer part of the EU, that has the potential to go away.\" HBO has so far declined to comment on possibility of the Brexit impacting production of the show, which is or has been filmed in Spain, Croatia, and Malta, in addition to Northern Ireland.

In her letter to European Council president Donald Tusk triggering Article 50, British Prime Minister Theresa May warned that failure to reach a comprehensive settlement would lead to a weakening in collaboration in the fight against crime and terrorism. Critics accused May of trying to make a trade-off between security and commerce. But Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said the two issues were mentioned side by side because they were \"all bound up in our membership of the European Union\". \"It's not a threat, I think that's the misunderstanding,\" he told BBC's Newsnight. \"It's absolutely not a threat.\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the letter was \"utterly scandalous\" and a \"blatant threat\", while Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, said the PM should not be using security as a \"bargaining chip\" in the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said: \"It is our clear desire and intention that we should continue to play a role as one of the indispensable guarantors of peace and stability in our continent.\" \"We want to continue to work with our counterparts on defence co-operation, intelligence sharing, counter-terrorism, foreign policy co-ordination - and much else besides - on an intergovernmental level. \"At the same time, the PM is right to spell out her vision of a Britain outside the single market - and outside the EU legal order - but able none the less to continue the trading relationship that is so important for businesses and consumers both sides of the Channel.\" In a \"historic moment from which there can be no turning back\", May set Britain on the path to life outside the EU when she triggered Article 50 yesterday. She immediately ran into resistance from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Parliament over her goal of conducting negotiations on Britain's trade relations with Europe at the same time as talks on arrangements for Brexit. \"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,\" May told Parliament yesterday, nine months after Britain shocked investors and world leaders by unexpectedly voting to quit the bloc. \"This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\" May now has one of the toughest jobs of any recent British leader: holding Britain together in the face of renewed Scottish independence demands, while conducting arduous talks with 27 other EU states on finance, trade, security and other complex issues. The outcome of the negotiations will shape the future of Britain's US$2.6 trillion ($3.7t) economy, the world's fifth biggest, and determine whether London can keep its place as one of the top two global financial centres. For the EU, already reeling from successive crises over debt and refugees, the loss of Britain is the biggest blow yet to 60 years of efforts to forge European unity in the wake of two world wars. Its leaders say they do not want to punish Britain. But with nationalist, anti-European Union parties on the rise across Europe, they cannot afford to give London generous terms that might encourage other member states to break away. France President Francois Hollande took the triggering of Article 50 as an opportunity to talk about the future of the bloc with its remaining 27 members. \"If we want to look at our future, it should be, first of all, real unity for the 27, but also with the possibility of going faster for some countries that so decide.\" Germany\"We are losing a strong and important member state,\" Chancellor Angela Merkel said following a telephone call with British Prime Minister Theresa May. Her Vice Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, struck a more upbeat note on Twitter: \"Let's stay friends, dear Brits!\" AustriaFor Chancellor Christian Kern, one of the main issues is Britain's considerable debts with the European Union. \"Considering the reported estimates of up to \u20ac60 billion ($92b) that the Britons still owe the EU, this will surely turn into a tough struggle,\" he said. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz showed more sympathy for Britain's decision to leave. \"Brexit has shown that citizens' worries and concerns must be taken seriously.\" As Britain will no longer contribute to the EU budget, the remaining countries should consider slashing costs rather than raising everyone's dues, Kurz added. Denmark\"Now it's farewell to Britain,\" said Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. \"In two years, the European family goes from 28 to 27 members. That is really sad.\" He added that he hoped \"the divorce between the EU and Britain can take place in a decent manner, and that we can keep close ties in future. That is in everyone's interest\". However, he warned: \"Britain's decision to leave the EU and the single market will have consequences. Rights and obligations go hand in hand.\" Sweden Sweden \"regrets the British decision\" to leave the EU, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven says, noting Britain has been \"a close and valuable partner\". Lofven welcomed the \"constructive tone\" in British Prime Minister Theresa May's letter triggering its exit from the bloc, adding that he wants \"structured and result-oriented negotiations so that [the EU], even after the exit, [has] as good and favourable relationship with Britain as possible\". The Czech Republic Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said that Britain's continued access to the single market after Brexit was completely out of the question. \"That is as if your wife says that she wants a divorce but would like to return to the family home at any given point in order to take what she wants,\" he said. Zaoralek warned that Britain would lose wealth and influence. The Netherlands \"For many people and businesses in the Netherlands, this starts a period of uncertainty,\" Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. The Netherlands exported \u20ac15b worth of goods to Britain in 2015 and 100,000 Dutch citizens live there. \"They want clarity as soon as possible about their future ...

While some such as Mr. Hunt favour a \u201chard\u201d Brexit and a complete break with the EU, others such as Chancellor Philip Hammond believe a preferable option would be maintain much of the existing relationship.Last month, Mr. Hammond faced anger from some within his party after telling delegates in Davos that the government would pursue just \u201cmodest\u201d changes to its relationship with Europe.Speaking on the BBC following the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Hunt said Britain would be pushing to adhere to EU rules and regulations on a \u201cvoluntary\u201d basis, pointing to the auto industry, whose supply chain was heavily integrated with Europe. However, the plan \u2014 which appears to have been thrashed out at the Cabinet meeting \u2014 is likely to face a muted response in Brussels, which has repeatedly stressed that Britain would not be able to \u201ccherry pick\u2019 the deal it struck with Europe.Practical answerBusiness groups have also continued to lobby for customs union membership. A customs union was the \u201cpractical, real world answer\u201d that solved some of the toughest questions, including over the future of the Irish border, and challenges faced by business, Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the Confederation of British Industry, said in January.Alongside the debate on the customs union, the question of a second referendum continues to surface, with commentators across the political spectrum arguing that the hugely divergent positions on the precise character of Brexit, necessitated a second vote.\u201cWe need to see what Brexit really does mean following the negotiation. Debate it in Parliament. And then, if no agreement can be reached there, put it back to the people so that they can say whether the Brexit proposed is what they want or not,\u201d wrote former Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Independent on Friday.Best for Britain, an anti-Brexit campaign group has continued to build support, raising over \u00a3200,000, with billionaire investor George Soros donating \u00a3400,000 to the group and pledging further matching funding. It is set to roll out a campaign across the U.K. in coming weeks.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:12:17 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-next-big-question-a-hard-or-soft-brexit/article22838477.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nDiary of a tough week: British government and the Brexit process\n", "classes": [], "content": "The past week has arguably been one of the most challenging for the British government since the 2016 referendum. It began with the momentous call by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to push for a customs union with the European Union, which firmly clarified the party\u2019s standing as a supporter of a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and one that has a pragmatic answer to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.It was telling that the proposal from a party led by an avowed socialist, committed to returning large sectors of services to state ownership, was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry as offering a \u201creal world\u201d solution, while Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary at the Department of International Trade until last year, compared Brexit to \u201cgiving up a three course meal... for the promise of a packet of crisps.\u201dThen came the EU\u2019s draft Withdrawal Agreement which translated into legal terms the progress of negotiations so far. It highlighted how far apart positions remained 20 months on from the referendum. Among its suggestions was that should no other agreement be reached, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union, creating, in effect, a border within the U.K. between the mainland and Northern Ireland. This proposal was welcomed by the Republic of Ireland and rejected outright by the Theresa May government.The government was also forced into a damage limitation exercise, as details emerged of a leaked letter from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in which he suggested that even a \u201chard border\u201d in Ireland would have limited impact on trade.And if that wasn\u2019t enough, in an extraordinary intervention, former Prime Minister John Major lambasted the current direction of government policy. He urged that a free vote be given to parliamentarians on the final deal along with the possibility of allowing for a second referendum, giving voice to the sizeable backing within the Conservative Party for a softer stance. He said in the highly acclaimed speech: \u201cOf course, the \u2018will of the people\u2019 can\u2019t be ignored but Parliament has a duty also to consider the well being of the people... The emerging evidence suggests Brexit will hurt most those who have the least. Neither Parliament nor government wish to see that.\u201d This was a reference to the oft-trotted out retort in the right-wing tabloids (and among some politicians) against those who sought to suggest that Brexit entail anything other than a clear break with the European single market and customs union.Then there was a bombshell from the U.S., which plans to slap a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminium exported there, and belatedly on cars from the EU. This appeared to make the U.S. President\u2019s suggestion that the U.K. and the U.S. could strike a \u201cgreat\u201d trade deal after Brexit rather questionable. The British government has signalled such deals \u2014 from the U.S. to India and Australia \u2014 would be key to its future success as a \u201cgreat trading nation\u201d.With all these developments it was little wonder that Ms. May appeared nervous ahead of her key Brexit speech on March 2. With EU leaders and industry awaiting details on Britain\u2019s stance, which has largely focussed on vision rather than substance so far, it would have been a particularly challenging time for a politician who was opposed to Brexit before the referendum. Following her speech, when asked by a journalist whether she regretted Brexit, Ms. May simply said that it was incumbent on Britain\u2019s politicians to deliver on the results of the referendum.Given the trying circumstances, and the competing positions of senior figures within her own party, Ms. May\u2019s speech was arguably as good as it could have been. Facing accusations that her previous key speeches were more focussed on vision than detail, this one got down to the nitty-gritty and belied the rose-tinted vision of the future served up by some of her cabinet colleagues.Both the EU and the U.K. would have to face some \u201chard facts\u201d, she said, and life would inevitably \u201cbe different\u201d. Access to each other\u2019s markets would be less than it is now. \u201cThis is a negotiation and neither of us can have exactly what we want,\u201d she said. Ms. May spelt out the details of what Britain would be willing to agree to. She said Britain may choose to commit some areas of regulations like state aid and competition to remaining in step with the EU\u2019s, and guaranteed that Britain would not \u201cengage in a race to the bottom on workers\u2019 rights or the environment\u201d. U.K. law would not necessarily be identical to EU law but would attempt to \u201cachieve the same outcomes\u201d. Britain and the EU should explore ways in which the U.K. could remain part of EU agencies such as those critical for chemicals, medicines and aerospace, she said. However, the EU would also need to introduce flexibility in its approach, she insisted. It had continually sought a tailored approach in its relationship with other nations, making Britain\u2019s insistence on a specifically tweaked deal, with sector-by-sector considerations, not unreasonable.\u201cIf this is cherry-picking, every trade deal is cherry-picking,\u201d she said. The Prime Minister also sought to offer specific solutions on the Irish question, such as an agreement to waive the requirements for entry and exit declarations for goods moving between the U.K. and the EU and a \u201ctrusted traders\u201d scheme to reduce delays at the border.The carefully crafted speech with reality checks appeared to offer something to a spectrum of views. While Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch advocate of a hard Brexit, welcomed the \u201cstatesman-like\u201d speech, Anna Soubry, a vocal Conservative rebel pushing for a modest move away from Europe, said it was an \u201chonest and conciliatory speech\u201d. Europe\u2019s chief negotiator on Brexit, Michel Barnier, welcomed the \u201cclarity\u201d and recognition of \u201ctrade-offs\u201d.Yet, there will be little time for Ms. May\u2019s government to rest on its laurels. Her speech offered a glimpse of the complexity ahead, following 20 months of bombastic, fuzzy vision. There will be fewer opportunities to fall back on trite references (\u201ctaking back control\u201d and a \u201cglobal Britain\u201d) when the reality suggests that these objectives are only partly achievable. Ms. May may have outlined the details of the niche deal she hopes to conclude, but it does little to change the EU\u2019s view on \u201ccherry-picking\u201d. The European Parliament\u2019s lead on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said: \u201cWhile I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake.\u201dIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested that even the details presented left many fundamental questions about the customs union and single market challenge for the island of Ireland unresolved. With just over a year to go before Britain officially leaves the EU, time is not on its side.vidya.ram@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:12:31 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/diary-of-a-tough-week/article22936051.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nThe referendum: Brexit and after\n", "classes": [], "content": "Our existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nDivided by the Brexit debate\n", "classes": ["drop-caps"], "content": " Last weekend, Labour party members queued outside the premises of Trinity, a school in the southeast London borough of Lewisham, where the hustings for the party\u2019s candidate for a forthcoming by-election was due to take place. Among the groups campaigning there was People\u2019s Vote, a cross-party group pushing for a public vote on any final Brexit deal reached with the European Union (EU).The choice of candidate Optimism was high among those campaigners about the potential signal that the by-election, triggered by the resignation of Heidi Alexander, the constituency\u2019s popular anti-Brexit MP, could have. Initially the loss of Ms. Alexander had been mourned by many seeking change in the party\u2019s approach to Brexit, but that soon gave way to hope as Janet Daby, a candidate who supports remaining in the European single market as well as the customs union, won the internal party contest by a large majority later that day.In the days running up to the by-election, the internal party contest had come to be seen as a reflection of the tensions within Labour. The choice of candidate was crucial: the party had won the seat by a comfortable majority in the general election last year, so the person chosen will, excepting a major upset, end up as the MP. The party put up three candidates, all ethnic minority women, reflecting different positions in the party. Ms. Daby, a centrist, supports maintaining very close ties with Europe, and has even in the past endorsed a second referendum. Sakina Sheikh, the candidate fielded by the left-wing Labour campaign group Momentum, has stuck firmly to the party\u2019s official line, insisting that remaining in the single market would mean \u201ctaking rules but having no power to make them\u201d. A third candidate, supported by unions and said to be close to the Labour leadership, also stuck closely to the party line.\u201cHugely significant that Janet Daby, sensible and strongly anti-Brexit, won,\u201d said Andrew Adonis, a Labour member of the House of Lords and a vocal anti-Brexit campaigner, following the result.Contradictory pullsWhile the by-election has reignited debate within the party about the direction of its strategy on Brexit, it has also highlighted the contradictory pulls on the party. Since the referendum, Labour has insisted that it had to abide by the decision of voters. \u201cLabour respects the result of the referendum and Britain is leaving the EU,\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech earlier this year.While 61% of those who voted Conservative in the 2015 general election voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, according to an analysis by YouGov, the choice that Labour was faced with was far more complex. About 65% of those who had voted Labour in 2015 voted to remain. However, while boroughs such as Lewisham voted heavily in favour of remaining, a number of northern Labour constituencies voted heavily to leave (despite, in many cases, having Labour MPs who campaigned to remain). From the early days after the referendum, Mr. Corbyn himself faced criticism over his approach, with some suggesting that more vigorous campaigning in favour of remaining from the Labour leadership could have yielded a different referendum result. Mr. Corbyn has shrugged off such suggestions. He said that despite being critical of the EU, he continued to believe that remaining in Europe was in Britain\u2019s best interests. However, the party\u2019s commitment to respecting the vote had led to it on occasion to vote against attempts to thwart Brexit legislation. Just earlier this month, 83 members of the House of Lords defied a party whip to not vote for an amendment requiring the government to negotiate membership of the single market (the Labour Party is officially against remaining in the single market but wants some form of customs union membership).Many have also pushed for clarity on the party\u2019s position on Brexit. Alongside uncertainty on what the party means by customs union membership, Labour has faced criticism over what its commitment involved in holding the government to account for its promise to deliver the same benefits outside the EU as it had inside of it. Would it be willing to oppose Brexit if those criteria were not met? The uncertainty has offered space for the resurgence of some of the older, centrist voices of the party, such as former leader Tony Blair, who in a blog warned that the party risked alienating voters, with its stance that offered the \u201cworst of both worlds\u201d convincing neither Remainers nor Leavers that it was taking up their fight.Adding to the pressure have been the growing questions over the referendum itself and the spending of various Leave campaign groups. Earlier this year Leave.EU, one of the main campaign groups, was fined over \u00a370,000 for breaching spending limits by Britain\u2019s Electoral Commission, while its CEO was referred to the police by electoral authorities. Vote Leave, the official leave campaign, supported by senior members of the cabinet, is also under investigation over its adherence to spending limits. The investigations have heartened a number of campaign groups that have sprung up to fill a political vacuum left by the two main political parties\u2019 stance on Brexit.Many concernsLast week, four northern Labour MPs joined forces to demand the party\u2019s support for a second referendum. \u201cWhatever you think of Brexit, there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s a big deal, and it is only now that the full implications of any Brexit deal are becoming apparent. People are therefore entitled to have their say on the deal before irrevocable steps are taken,\u201d they wrote in a letter to Mr. Corbyn. A poll of Labour party members earlier this year found that over three-quarters wanted Britain to remain in the single market and the customs union, while leaders of Labour students and Young Labour came together to urge the party leadership to hold a vote on Brexit at a forthcoming conference. How much these concerns will be heeded remains to be seen. vidya.ram@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:13:02 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/divided-by-the-brexit-debate/article23980903.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\nBrexit law faces crucial Commons vote\n", "classes": [], "content": "\nA video grab from footage broadcast by the U.K. Parliament\u2019s Parliamentary Recording Unit shows Minister Phillip Lee speaking in the Houses of Parliament in London on January 23, 2018. \u00a0\n| Photo Credit: \nAFP\n British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a knife-edge vote in parliament on June 12 on her centrepiece Brexit legislation, despite her last-minute warning that defeat risks undermining her negotiations with Brussels. MPs in the House of Commons will vote on a raft of amendments produced by the House of Lords, including one at around 3 p.m. GMT (8.30 p.m. IST) that would give parliament an effective veto over Brexit.Just hours before the vote, the pressure on Ms. May cranked up when a pro-E.U. Junior Minister quit the government so he could back the veto proposal. Philip Lee said a choice between \u201cbad and worse\u201d options was not giving MPs a meaningful vote.

I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the E.U. which is as frictionless as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.\u201d\u2018No deal\u2019 scenarioThe E.U. (Withdrawal) Bill is the draft law that would set the legal framework for Brexit and Ms. May is worried about the prospect of a rebellion by pro-E.U. Conservative MPs keen to retain the changes.Some europhile Conservatives were reported to be backing away, worried that if Ms. May was fatally damaged by defeat, it could open the way for a hardline Brexiteer to take over the party and thereby the premiership. Attention has focused on June 12 on the so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d amendment, which would give parliament the power to decide what to do if it rejects the final Brexit deal.Mr. Lee resigned from the Ministry of Justice to back the amendment, saying parliament should be able to direct the government to change course. \u201cI cannot support the government\u2019s decision to oppose this amendment because doing so breaches such fundamental principles of human rights and parliamentary sovereignty,\u201d he said. \u201cA vote between bad and worse is not a meaningful vote.\u201dFormer Attorney-general Dominic Grieve, a leading pro-E.U. rebel, has put down a compromise amendment on the meaningful vote, calling for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons setting out how to proceed in the event of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit.\u201cA meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum,\u201d Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC radio. \u201cThe end of March 2019, we leave the E.U.

It is in the process of leaving the European Union (EU) \u2013 the impending withdrawal being referred to as Brexit (Britain + Exit). Brexit had its beginning in a referendum in June 2016 when the majority of the U.K. voted in support of a departure from the EU. Brexit is a long process involving several rounds of discussions among the British cabinet members and negotiations with the EU before an official exit could take place on the scheduled date of March 29, 2019. But now, the British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a crisis. The top ministers in her cabinet who were spearheading the negotiations have resigned over disagreement with her on how to conduct the nation's exit from the EU.What is Brexit? Why is it important for the people of the U.K.? Let\u2019s find out in this week\u2019s Five Ws & One H.Britain has been a member of the EU since 1973. But on June 23, 2016, the U.K. made a historic decision to withdraw its membership. A referendum was held to know the U.K. citizens\u2019 preferences. Of the total 33 million votes, 52% chose to leave the group, while 48% wanted to stay on. The U.K. comprises England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The majority of the voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland, however, chose to remain.The European Union (EU) is a group of 28 countries in the continent of Europe. After World War II, some European countries came together to form a group to foster economic, social and political co-operation. They saw this as a means to stay united and not go to war with each other. With France and Germany taking the initiative, four other nations namely Belgium, Italy, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, signed up to form the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957.People in support of the exit view the EU to be exercising too much control over Britain, thereby halting its growth. One of the main areas of contention is immigration. The people of the U.K. are against the EU\u2019s key principle of \u2018Free Movement\u2019 within member states. The U.K. Independence Party was the primary driver behind the \u2018Brexit\u2019 campaign.Those who campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU argued that the immigrants would only boost economic growth. They were of the view that the EU membership would ensure security for the nation in times of crisis.But on July 8, the Brexit process plunged into turmoil when David Davis resigned over disagreements with Theresa May. Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis was given the responsibility for Brexit talks. Following Davis\u2019 resignation, his deputy, Steve Baker, and another Brexit minister, Suella Braverman, resigned, threatening to destabilise May\u2019s government. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson too quit a day later.These are terms used during debates. \u2018Hard\u2019 Brexit would mean making no compromise with the EU \u2013 there will be no free movement of people within the EU member countries, Britain will leave the EU single market once and for all, and the EU will be treated as any other country when it comes to trade (based on the World Trade Organisation rules).On the other hand, a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit would mean keeping close ties with the EU, a degree of free movement and enjoying some form of membership of the EU\u2019s single market.A final summit is to take place on October 18, 2018, when both the U.K. and the EU hope to reach an agreement on future relations. Once the deal has been struck, the U.K. will have to leave the EU by March 29, 2019. A transition period will then last until the midnight of December 31, 2020, when the final exit will happen.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.Our existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts."}{"head": "\n\u2018It\u2019s about saving Britain, it\u2019s not about Brexit\u2019\n", "classes": [], "content": "Gina Miller, n\u00e9e Gina Singh, was thrust into the spotlight in 2016 after a London court appointed her as the lead claimant in a case that attempted to ensure that the British government sought parliamentary approval before triggering Article 50, Britain\u2019s formal notification of withdrawal from the European Union (EU). Born in Guyana, with part Indian ancestry, and the daughter of that country\u2019s former attorney general, Ms. Miller pursued a number of campaigns before the one on Brexit, including one to increase greater transparency in the British financial services industry. The backlash she faced from sections of the right in Britain after the court accepted her arguments on the need for parliamentary approval have not prevented her from continuing to be a vocal progressive voice on Brexit-related issues, sexual harassment, and the \u00a31 billion deal struck between the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservatives. In this interview in London, she speaks about the principles that drive her work, Brexit, and why she is a fan of the colour purple. Excerpts:You\u2019ve campaigned on a wide range of issues \u2014 transparency in the fund management industry, Brexit, and the implementation of the EU\u2019s new regulatory reforms for financial institutions. What is it that binds these campaigns?I\u2019ve been a campaigner for over 20 years. Starting from small local campaigns and building up to big international ones, it\u2019s always been: you need to shine a light in dark corners because that exposes a lot of the dubious behaviour that goes on. Secondly, I think there has to be accountability and scrutiny or else we get corruption. Thirdly, you have to always ensure that every industry has a societal responsibility.What was it that led you down this route?I grew up in a very political household. My father was an attorney general, and I grew up with a strong sense of justice. Because of that I knew a lot of things that went wrong as well. And I saw the human cost of that, which tended to be women and children. I realised that as a woman I could play\nquite a different role to the men who were fighting for the same principles I believe in.\nWhat do you think you can do that is different?I think I can come at it from a different perspective. We may end up at the same conclusion, but my thought process and how I evaluate things are far more holistic. I am not so headstrong going down one particular path; I explore lots of paths and look at things more collaboratively. I also don\u2019t need to be at the front of things. I can be in the background, connect people, make things happen and create solutions. If you are able to do that \u2014 create the right environment for ideas to flourish and pass them on to other people \u2014 you can do a lot more.When you joined the Brexit case, were you aware of what you\u2019d be in for?In this case, something that people don\u2019t appreciate is that I didn\u2019t make myself the lead claimant; it was the courts that appointed me. I was never supposed to be in this position. Someone from the right-wing press later told me: \u2018Gina, the courts gave us the best person they could have, you were an avatar of hate. A woman, coloured, articulate \u2014 it was exactly what we needed. A gift.\u2019How did you deal with it? If you went back in time, would you do it again?In my previous campaigns, I had seen my share of hostility. But when people pick on you \u2014 the way you look and sound, the horrendous threats of violence and gang rape, threats to slit your kids\u2019 throats in front of you, they sent reporters to try and find skeletons in my family \u2014 I wondered, how do I fight this? And then I realised I had to be me. I had to be completely honest and not let them get to me. Because if you act with grace and intelligence and you believe what you are doing, people can\u2019t touch you. If you don\u2019t give them permission to destroy you, they can\u2019t actually do it.And something different happened around the Supreme Court hearing: more people started writing to me. On the wall I have a letter from a little girl who drew me a \u2018Go, Gina\u2019 superhero badge. I realised I could give people hope and it gave me the strength to carry on. Yes, there are always fewer voices \u2014 for every hundred horrible things, I get four or five positives \u2014 but they are definitely worth it.Knowing everything I do now, I would have done exactly the same thing, but I would have knocked [on the doors of] a few corporates and others to fund me earlier. I thought they\u2019d join in once they\u2019d seen how well we were doing but they were all frightened and they all put their hands in their pockets. The burden of funding has been enormous as has been the cost of security. I would have also explained things to my children sooner. Children are far more resilient than we think. But when it came to taking action, knowing all that I do now... absolutely, I would do it all again.Parliament has given the go-ahead and much got through Parliament. Are you happy with the direction of things now?It\u2019s an absolute indication of where we are politically: we have a bullying culture in both the main political parties, and good MPs with integrity are continually threatened with losing their seats or being deselected. It\u2019s not the structure that is broken; it\u2019s the people in charge and that\u2019s why nothing is going to change. Which is why as much as I fought for parliamentary sovereignty, I think it\u2019s dysfunctional. It needs to be the people who have the voice. And I think at the end of this process there needs to be a people\u2019s vote on all the options [for Brexit] and not just a parliamentary vote because I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll [Parliament] vote for the best interests of the country.Should Britain have a second referendum?\n\nI don\u2019t think so, but [it should have] a people\u2019s vote on all the options: whatever deal we get, no deal and remaining. But we can\u2019t turn the clock back so [the campaign to remain] would have to be \u2018remain with a reform agenda\u2019. The question is, how do we get to a better place and how do we mend this country? We are now living in a very divided, hostile country. Even if I had a magic wand tomorrow and we could withdraw Article 50, it\u2019s not going to heal this country. We have to think about the bigger picture: the future of Britain is more than Brexit and there are lots of people fighting for \u2018remain\u2019 and \u2018leave\u2019 who are stuck in the past and don\u2019t realise what the true agenda is now. It\u2019s about saving this country, it\u2019s not about Brexit.How do you go about that?We have to change the language we use and try and move people beyond \u2018remain\u2019 and \u2018leave\u2019. There are too many irresponsible people in power who are using Brexit as a power play. It has to come from people with integrity in all walks of life, not just politicians. You could argue that part of the reason for Brexit was that people were irresponsible. We lived in our comfortable bubbles and forgot about others. We didn\u2019t understand what the impact was on different parts of society. We need to step out of our comfort zones and take some responsibility.Can this happen? Are you an optimist?I think what is happening is not defined by nationhood; it\u2019s about people as human beings. The major issues facing us have no national boundaries. The gap between the have and the have-nots is growing ever deeper. All round the world you have companies that have no global home and don\u2019t pay taxes, terrorism knows no boundaries, [there is] lack of water and electricity. We have to fight them together; it\u2019s not about individual countries. If people in positions of power and responsibility can come together to think [about] how they can effect change, we can start changing hearts and minds.What about forums such as Davos?I think Davos is part of the problem. It\u2019s an outdated and opaque place for rich men to hide, rich businesses to make secret deals behind back doors. I would scrap Davos tomorrow.What are your next steps?To me there is the immediate \u2018going to war\u2019 almost \u2014 the immediate problem and the longer-term conversation to be had once the short term has been dealt with. We will survive [Brexit], we will have the downturn, and no one will take the blame, but after that I think the conversations I\u2019m starting to have already is about thinking about politics in a different way. You can\u2019t deal with violence, education, poverty, inequality without\njoined up thinking\nand on 3/5-year policy cycles.\nYou need ones that are cross-party and have long-term strategies in place.I\u2019m a great lover of the colour purple. I speak at lots of schools and say to the kids: \u2018If we could mix the colours of all the [British political] parties, you\u2019d get purple.\u2019 I\u2019m a great advocate of purple politics which puts the country and the people before money and politics.Will Brexit happen?It\u2019s very complicated. I don\u2019t believe politicians or Brexiteers have any grasp of the legal, domestic or international aspects of this, and they will end up being tied up in legislation for years to come. There is also a significant misunderstanding about Brexit: they have an idea that you can stop the relationship and move on, but it\u2019s not moving on. It\u2019s reversing 44 years of integration. They also talk about lowering regulations, but the rest of the world is converging on regulation and they are going down a route the rest of the world isn\u2019t.How do you pick your battles?I tend to pick battles that I can win. I am also always looking at unintended consequences. For every action you can have a ripple effect which is not necessarily the one you want. Things are never black or white and if there is a danger, the unintended consequence could hurt people and be more damaging than the win.

A movement has been growing in the country for over 20 years. In 1997, James Goldsmith, a multi-millionaire, launched the Referendum Party which fielded candidates in every seat, not even one of whom got elected.Another fringe party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), emerged soon after to argue for withdrawal from the EU. The Conservative Party was divided between those who wanted to leave the European Union and those who were supportive. The former were fervent supporters of Margaret Thatcher and the rest were happy she had gone by 1991.When he became leader of the party in 2005, David Cameron vowed to make his party stop obsessing about Europe. To shut up his troublesome party faction, Cameron held a referendum on the question of whether the UK should remain in the EU or leave it. To his surprise, the voters chose to leave by a margin of two million votes or 4 percentage points, with a voter turnout of 74 per cent. Cameron resigned as his policy had failed.His successor Theresa May was chosen by the Conservative Parliamentary Party and famously said \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d.The question remained: what did Brexit mean. The European Union is a Customs Union which has no tariffs on trade moving from one country to another within the EU. There are tariffs on goods from outside unless a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been signed (the EU and India have been negotiating on an FTA for years). There is also a single market, which means professional people can work anywhere within the EU no matter where they were trained. Health and safety rules are standardised. So the question has been: how does the UK place itself vis-a-vis EU after Brexit? A hard Brexit would mean severing all ties and becoming a third country as India is to the EU.Then there were degrees of association preserved which got labelled as soft Brexit. Soft can go from some retained association to a much deeper one, which almost meant no Brexit. Political divisions on this issue run through both the ruling party and the Opposition. The process of leaving has a time limit, which ends on March 29, 2019. The UK has to negotiate with the European Commission.Time was running out and no certainty had emerged. Theresa May continued to be ambiguous as people suspected she was a weak Prime Minister. There were Big Beasts within the Cabinet who openly criticised her. So on July 6, she gathered her Cabinet at Chequers, the Prime Minister\u2019s weekend retreat. She presented a soft Brexit proposal and surprisingly, the entire Cabinet agreed. This surprised many MPs because there were said to be hard Brexit champions who had promised a rebellion. The hard Brexit camp realised they had lost. Many said they would challenge May\u2019s leadership and provoke a leadership election.Two Cabinet ministers and a few junior ministers have resigned since, but by not resigning on the spot at the July 6 Cabinet meeting, they lost face. But at the end of the day, Brexit policy has been formulated by a Prime Minister controlling her Cabinet and marginalising her rivals. But it is also a lesson in how Cabinets can discuss, disagree and decide.No one expected him to be so engaged in improving relations with Pakistan when he was foreign minister.

May hopes it will jumpstart the acrimonious discussions about the terms of Brexit.\u00a0May is seeking to squelch public dissent from Conservative Party colleagues by warning ministers she will no longer tolerate public criticism of government policy now that the Cabinet has backed her.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s made it very clear that if people can\u2019t stick to her position then they should go, and I think that\u2019s good,\u201d Conservative Party legislator Nicky Morgan said on Saturday.May said after the Cabinet meeting that her ministers Cabinet endorsed plans for a future free-trade deal with the European Union that would keep some close ties to the bloc even as it ends freedom of movement between Britain and the EU. The proposal would allow free movement of goods, but not of services.\u00a0The agreement hammered out at the prime minister\u2019s country residence resolves \u2014 for the moment \u2014 a long-running dispute within the Cabinet over whether to sever all ties with the EU or seek a more limited Brexit to help businesses accustomed to trading with continental Europe without customs payments or burdensome paperwork.Since becoming prime minister nearly two years ago, May \u2014 whose party does not enjoy a majority in Parliament \u2014 has endured outspoken criticism from senior ministers, most notably Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who wants a total rupture with the EU.\u00a0She has now signaled however, in a letter to Conservative Party legislators, that ministers who dissent in public will be dismissed now that \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d has been restored.The plan brings May squarely down on the side those favoring a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit that would make it easier for many businesses to operate without new barriers being erected between Britain and continental Europe.It\u2019s unclear how EU negotiators will react to the plan, which seems to fly in the face of EU warnings that the UK cannot pick and choose which aspects of EU membership it would like to keep, and it is already angering hard-line Brexiteers who advocate a total break with the EU."}{"head": "Britons ever more deeply divided over Brexit, research\u00a0finds", "classes": [], "content": "Why only 23% of all rural income comes from agricultureThe social divide revealed by Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the European Union is not only here to stay but deepening, according to academic research published on Wednesday. Think tank The UK in a Changing Europe said Britons were unlikely to change their minds about leaving the EU, despite the political and economic uncertainty it has brought, because attitudes are becoming more entrenched.\u201cThe (Brexit) referendum highlighted fundamental divisions in British society and superimposed a leave-remain distinction over them. This has the potential to profoundly disrupt our politics in the years to come,\u201d said Anand Menon, the think tank\u2019s director.Britain is negotiating a deal with the EU which will shape future trade relations, breaking with the bloc after four decades, but the process is complicated by the divisions within parties, society and the government itself.Menon said the research, based on a series of polls over the 18-month period since Britain voted to leave the European Union, showed 35 percent of people self-identify as \u201cLeavers\u201d and 40 percent as \u201cRemainers\u201d.Research also found that both sides had a tendency to interpret and recall information in a way that confirmed their pre-existing beliefs which also added to the deepening of the impact of the vote.The differences showed fragmentation was more determined by age groups and location than by economic class.Polls have shown increasing support for a second vote on whether or not to leave the European Union once the terms of departure are known, but such a vote would not necessarily provide a different result, a poll by ICM for the Guardian newspaper indicated last week.The report also showed that age was a better pointer to how Britons voted than employment. Around 73 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds voted to stay in the EU, but turnout among that group was lower than among older voters.\u201cBritish Election Study surveys have suggested that, in order to have overturned the result, a startling 97 percent of under-45s would have had to make it to the ballot box, as opposed to the 65 percent who actually voted,\u201d the report said.The difference between generations became even more pronounced in the 2017 general election, when the largest gap in how different generations voted was measured in Britain.The British Election Study has been conducted by academics at every general election since 1964 and looks at why people vote, and why they vote the way they do."}{"head": "Brexit: UK PM Theresa May says Donald Trump told her to sue European\u00a0Union", "classes": [], "content": "Why only 23% of all rural income comes from agricultureBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said U.S. President Donald Trump had previously advised her to sue the European Union as part of her Brexit strategy, disclosing a piece of advice Trump said last week she had ignored. \u201cHe told me I should sue the EU,\u201d May told BBC television. \u201cSue the EU.

In an attempt to add detail to Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiation, May said the new trading relationship will need binding reciprocal agreements but that British laws need not be the same as the EU to achieve the same regulatory outcomes.May said that in chemicals, aviation and medicine, Britain would seek to abide by EU regulation and proposed a streamlined customs partnership with the same tariffs at the border for goods sold to the EU. \u201cWe are now approaching a crucial moment,\u201d she told ambassadors and business leaders in the Mansion House, the 18th century official home of the Lord Mayor of London in the heart of the capital\u2019s financial district.\u201cWe will need an arbitration mechanism that is completely independent, something which again is common to free trade agreements,\u201d May said. She added that financial services should be part of the future relationship and that Britain would need a collaborative and objective framework to oversee financial services trade.Her lectern featured the slogan, \u201cOur Future Partnership\u201d, the title of her speech which rounds off a series of briefings by her ministers on how Britain sees its future outside the EU and its economic architecture after more than 40 years in the bloc. EU leaders are increasingly frustrated by what they say is a lack of detail from London on what it wants, and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that time is short to reach a deal by October in time for Britain\u2019s 2019 exit.May, weak after losing her parliamentary majority last year, has struggled to satisfy the demands not only of EU officials but also of the warring factions in her Conservative Party and major businesses which are desperate for clarity.FIVE TESTS She said she would be guided by five tests including respecting the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum and reaching a solution that can endure. \u201cWe are close to agreement on the terms of the implementation period which was a key element in the December deal,\u201d May said. \u201cBoth the UK and EU are clear this implementation period must be time-limited and cannot become a permanent solution.\u201d One of the most difficult Brexit questions is how to avoid a hard border between the United Kingdom\u2019s Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The EU set out a backup plan in a draft withdrawal agreement this week that effectively would see Northern Ireland remaining part of the EU\u2019s customs union. That could mean that Northern Ireland would have different rules from the rest of the United Kingdom, something May said on Wednesday \u201cno UK prime minister could ever agree to\u201d.\u201cWe have been clear all along that we don\u2019t want to go back to a hard border in Northern Ireland,\u201d May said. \u201cJust as it would be unacceptable to go back to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it would also be unacceptable to break up the United Kingdom\u2019s own common market by making a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea.\u201d"}{"head": "VIDEO: Here\u2019s what Donald Trump said on Brexit; people can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s funny or\u00a0sad", "classes": [], "content": "Why only 23% of all rural income comes from agricultureAlthough Donald Trump has left UK for a summit with\u00a0Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, \u00a0the buzz around his visit doesn\u2019t seem to be dying down just yet.\u00a0 A video of Trump\u2019s remarks on Brexit from a NATO summit is going viral.\u00a0When asked about his thoughts on Brexit, Trump bizarrely went on tell the audience about his properties in Britain and that his mother was Scottish and how he won Wisconsin \u2014 a state that was never won by President Ronald Reagon.For safe measure he also added that British people \u201cvoted to break it up, so I imagine that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do but maybe they\u2019re taking a different route \u2013 I don\u2019t know if that is what they voted for\u201d.Underlining immigration as a cause for Brexit, he further said, \u201cI think they agree with me on immigration\u2026 You see what\u2019s going on throughout the world with immigration\u2026 I think that\u2019s why Brexit happened.\u201dThe video has not only left the British offended, it has led to many calling him a \u201cnarcissist\u201d.Watch the video here:Here\u2019s how people are reacting to it:Trump\u2019s visit to the UK was\u00a0overshadowed by an explosive interview in The Sun newspaper in which he blasted May, blamed London\u2019s mayor for terrorist attacks against the city and argued that Europe was \u201closing its culture\u201d because of immigration.

Sandwiched between a NATO meeting and a summit with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, Trump\u2019s first visit to Britain as president comes at one of the most important junctures for Europe and the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.From challenging Western assumptions about the EU and free trade to courting the Kremlin and North Korea\u2019s leader, Trump has delivered on his promise of an \u201cunpredictable\u201d U.S. foreign policy.That leaves May, who held hands with Trump at the White House during her visit after his inauguration, in a difficult position as she seeks closer trade ties with the United States to offset the disruption of leaving the EU on March 29, 2019. \u201cThe irony is that by leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will be less useful to Washington as an ally but it will also need the United States much more,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Stacey, a former State Department official in Obama\u2019s administration.\u201cSo May has been thrown into the arms of the most unpredictable U.S. president in living memory,\u201d Stacey said. Over 50,000 people have signed up for a protest on Trafalgar Square in central London against the Trump visit, which will include a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and possibly even a round of golf at his Turnberry course in Scotland.Even taking account of Trump\u2019s penchant for deal-making, the visit is likely to be heavy on rhetoric about an increasingly lopsided \u201cspecial relationship\u201d and short on specifics such as the details of a post-Brexit trade deal.For supporters, Trump and Brexit offer the prospect of breaking free from what they see as obsolete institutions and rules that have weakened the United States and its allies relative to competitors such as China. But for many British diplomats, Brexit marks the collapse of a 70-year British strategy of trying to balance European integration with a U.S. alliance based on blood, trade and intelligence sharing.\u201cMay\u2019s rushed diplomacy with Trump has been foolish: what has she actually got out of the relationship so far?\u201d said one senior European diplomat in London, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\u201cYou Brits are leaving Europe but do you really want to jump into the arms of Donald Trump\u2019s America? And more importantly, do you have a choice?\u201d the diplomat asked.HOLDING HANDS\nTrump\u2019s victory in the 2016 presidential election shocked British diplomats in Washington and relations between May, a vicar\u2019s daughter, and Trump have been strained at times. The enduring image of May\u2019s visit to the White House in January 2017, when she became the first foreign leader to meet the president after he took office, was Trump taking May\u2019s hand to help her down the steps of a White House colonnade.But any good vibrations from that moment soon dissipated when Trump, the same day, announced plans to ban migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries \u2013 a decision that drew fierce international criticism and appeared to blindside May.Days later, thousands marched on parliament to protest the decision to offer a Trump full state visit to Britain, and 1.8 million people signed a petition saying the invitation should be canceled because he might embarrass the Queen. Trump has repeatedly thwarted British and other European diplomatic overtures, withdrawing from multilateral agreements on climate change, human rights, and a treasured deal to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting sanctions.Officials around May insist that Britain still has the capability to influence Trump, outlining a handling strategy that involves appealing to his self-interest, \u201cplanting the seed\u201d of an idea and allowing him time to consider its merits.But, much will rest on the personal dynamic between May, a staid, career politician who prides herself on careful decision-making, and Trump, the brash, often-bellicose, former reality TV star who declared last month he would know within a minute whether a deal could be struck with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un.\u201cWe talk about Trump and Macron because it seems interesting with some upsides. We talk about Trump and Angela Merkel because it\u2019s \u2018difficult'\u201d said Leslie Vinjamuri, head of the U.S. and Americas programme at the Chatham House think tank.\u201cTheresa May gets a bit lost in all of that. She has neither been strong nor weak, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any special affection.\u201dAsked at last month\u2019s G7 meeting in Canada whether Trump was a \u201cgood friend\u201d to Britain, May said: \u201cThe United States and the United Kingdom are good friends. President Trump and I work together.\u201d\nBut just hours after the meeting concluded he tore up a joint communique on trade, equality and the environment that May and other G7 leaders had labored late into the night to agree.

May\u2019s position was further undermined by Trump who said in an interview published in Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun newspaper on Friday that her proposals would probably kill off any chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the world\u2019s biggest economy.Though Trump later contradicted his comments by then promising a great U.S. trade deal, the president made clear his admiration for the 54-year-old Johnson, who Trump said would one day make a great British prime minister.\nSteve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former adviser, was even quoted by Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph as saying that it was now time for Johnson to challenge May for her job. \u201cNow is the moment,\u201d The Telegraph quoted Bannon, Trump\u2019s former strategist and a key player in his 2016 election campaign, as saying. \u201cIf Boris Johnson looks at this\u2026 There comes an inflection point, the Chequers deal was an inflection point, we will have to see what happens,\u201d Bannon said.BREXIT TEST FOR MAYJohnson, the face of the Brexit campaign for many has remained silent in public since he warned in his resignation letter on July 9 that the \u201cBrexit dream\u201d was being suffocated by needless self-doubt. The Telegraph newspaper said Johnson had re-joined the newspaper as a columnist with effect from Monday. The extent of divisions within May\u2019s Conservative Party over Brexit will become clearer over the course of two debates in parliament over coming days.Pro-Brexit lawmakers are expected to use a debate on Monday on customs legislation to try to force her to harden up her Brexit plan, while a debate on trade on Tuesday will see pro-EU lawmakers push for even closer ties with the bloc.Brexiteer rebels are unlikely to have enough support in parliament to win a vote, but the debate will show how many in May\u2019s party are prepared to vote against her at a time when some are look to gather the necessary numbers to challenge her leadership."}{"head": "EU tells Britain to \u2018face up to hard facts\u2019 on\u00a0Brexit", "classes": [], "content": "Why only 23% of all rural income comes from agricultureThe European Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier hammered home again on Tuesday that Britain would not retain its current privileges, including on trade, once it leaves the bloc.

The tickets are expensive, and the youngsters prefer to spend holidays in Turkey or Morocco,\" says Nafees.\"When I was younger, we would come every year, but this is the first time after four years,\" says Alisha Iqbal, a young Birmingham financial analyst who is enjoying her last day in Mirpur, filling her luggage with colorful outfits and local ingredients.\"I don't have that much holidays, so I tend to choose closer, cheaper destination.\"Even among the second generation who continue to visit the city, few send money back to Pakistan.And apart from the arranged marriages between British and Pakistani Mirpuris, emigrant families are not returning as often to celebrate their weddings in Kashmir.For Nadeem Hussain, a fast food manager in Stoke-on-Trent, the ties that bind the communities will likely fade into oblivion within a generation or two.His family serves as a textbook example of the fraying relations. Twenty years ago, his father built a home in Kashmir and bought land hoping to retire back in Mirpur.But now his father has abandoned those plans.\"Pakistan has changed, it is too complicated to come back,\" he explains while sharing a dessert with his two-year-old daughter. \"I don't think my daughter's children will retain that many links with Mirpur.\""}{"head": "\nIndian companies integral to post-Brexit growth in UK: reports\n", "classes": [], "content": "London: Nearly 800 Indian companies in Britain had a combined revenue of 46.4 billion pounds, employed nearly 105,000 people and paid 360 million pounds in corporation tax over the previous year, a new report said, emphasising that Indian investment remains integral to post-Brexit growth in the UK.The 'India Meets Britain Tracker 2018', released annually by professional services major Grant Thornton in collaboration with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), has identified a record 87 fast-growing Indian companies in Britain to conclude that Indian investment remains integral to post-Brexit growth in the UK.\u00a0\"The report clearly shows that the UK remains a highly attractive destination for Indian investors,\u201d said Anuj Chande, Head of South Asia Group at Grant Thornton UK, yesterday.\"Following the Brexit vote, the UK economy is in a period of flux as it looks at how to reinvigorate its role as a global trading nation and seeks to forge new trade deals.

leaders at a summit on Friday to move Brexit talks onto trade as quickly as possible, as they prepared to sign off on an interim deal on the divorce.Her 27 counterparts are expected to agree on Friday that sufficient progress has been made on key separation issues including the divorce bill and the Irish border to move the negotiations onto the future relationship.\u00a0The EU's negotiating guidelines state they will start talks on a post-Brexit transition in January but will not begin trade talks until March, calling for more clarity about Britain's goals.Addressing the leaders over a night dinner of roasted langoustines, ballotine of capon and \"festive log with a twist\", May was \"clear about wanting to move onto trade talks as quickly as possible\", a British official said.May told them she \"makes no secret of wanting to move onto the next phase and to approach it with ambition and creativity\", adding that a \"particular priority\" should be the transition period.The British premier had earlier sought to brush off a parliamentary defeat over her Brexit strategy, in which members of her Conservative party rebelled to demand a final vote over the terms of the withdrawal.May said she was \"disappointed\" at the setback, which critics warned could undermine her authority to deliver a deal, but stressed: \"We're on course to deliver Brexit.\"Several other EU leaders sought to play down the impact of the vote, although Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel warned that the domestic opposition was \"not making her life easier\".Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said May still had a \"formidable stature\" in Brussels, saying that last week's hard-fought agreement on the divorce deal \"showed you should not underestimate her\".However, with British ministers only due to discuss the post-Brexit future next week, he warned that \"we need from her to understand how she sees the future relationship\".German Chancellor Angela Merkel added that while progress has been made, there were still \"outstanding questions\".After months of tortuous negotiations, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker struck a deal with May last week on the outline terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU in March 2019.It covers Britain's financial settlement, the future of the Irish border and expatriate rights, while the next stage will cover trade and a transition period to ease the break.British officials are hoping for a deal by March on a two-year transition, during which the bilateral relationship would largely stay the same, although Britain would have to follow EU laws.However, the EU has warned May that her hopes of agreeing a bespoke trade deal before Brexit to replace Britain's membership of the EU's single market and customs union is unrealistic.\"I'm looking forward to discussing that deep and special partnership for the future,\" May said as she arrived for the summit.If Wednesday's vote pointed to the battles May still faces at home over Brexit, EU President Donald Tusk acknowledged the bloc's own unity would be tested in the months ahead.\"I have no doubt that the real test of our unity will be the second phase of the Brexit talks,\" Tusk told reporters as he arrived at the summit.He said a \"lack of unity is very visible\" on two key subjects facing the EU after Britain leaves: plans for a way forward on the migration crisis, and proposals for reforms of the eurozone.However, Tusk warned earlier this week of a \"furious race against time\" to reach the next stage of negotiations.Questions still linger over the divorce agreement, after British Brexit Minister David Davis appeared to suggest it was not legally enforceable.There are particular concerns about the guarantee made by London -- at Dublin's request -- that there will be no frontier checks between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland Davis's comments prompted a warning by the EU that Britain must not backtrack, and Rutte repeated on Thursday: \"We cannot have a misunderstanding of what was agreed.\""}{"head": "\nBrexit: Britain asks Facebook for info on Russia-linked 'fake news'\n", "classes": [], "content": "London:

no second referendum on Brexit, a spokesman for Britain\u2019s Theresa May said on Monday (July 16), repeating the prime minister\u2019s belief that her plan for leaving the European Union was the only way to get a deal that meets the government\u2019s aims.\u201cThe British public have voted to leave the European Union. There is not going to be a second referendum ... under any circumstances,\u201d the spokesman told reporters.The spokesman's comments came after a former senior British minister called on Monday\u00a0for another referendum to solve a parliamentary stalemate on Brexit, saying May's proposals for new ties with the European Union were a fudge that satisfied no one.Justine Greening, a former education secretary who quit the government in January, said May's negotiating strategy would neither please those who wanted a clean break with the EU nor those who opposed Brexit altogether.\"We'll be dragging Remain voters out of the EU for a deal that means still complying with many EU rules, but now with no say on shaping them,\" Greening wrote in the Times newspaper.\"It's not what they want, and on top of that when they hear that Leave voters are unhappy, they ask, 'What's the point?'. For Leavers, this deal simply does not deliver the proper break from the European Union that they wanted.\"May has\u00a0previously\u00a0ruled out a rerun of the 2016 vote in which Britons voted 52-48 per cent to leave the bloc.Her Brexit negotiating strategy, which aims for a close relationship with the EU after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019, was only agreed with her Cabinet earlier this month after two years of wrangling. Two senior ministers resigned in protest shortly afterwards.May is now facing a possible rebellion from Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party who want her to ditch her plan when lawmakers vote on amendments to legislation on the government's post-Brexit customs regime on Monday.However, she has told unhappy lawmakers that they needed to back her or risk there being no Brexit at all.Greening said that with divisions in the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party over how to proceed with Brexit, there should be another vote, with the public able to choose between May's plans, a \"no-deal\" break with the EU or remaining in the bloc.\"The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people,\" she said.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has an incentive to take things to the edge - possibly beyond October, the current deadline for a deal - so she can get her version of any exit agreement through Parliament; she is more interested in a last-second, cliffhanger vote than in a protracted debate.The EU, frustrated by a British side that has nothing to offer, has been talking about the likelihood of a hard Brexit for more than a year, but that could be just a demonstration of willingness to walk away from the table.If there is no deal, Britain will drop out of the EU in March next year without a transition period. That will create gaps in regulations and the capacity to enforce them, mainly in Britain.The Financial Times recently reported that the British government isn't doing much about that because it doesn't consider \"no deal\" a realistic scenario. But believing that the sides are bluffing can result in nasty surprises because the negotiations aren't exactly poker. It's a game in which the interests of some of those at the table - at least when it comes to many Conservative Brexiters - are not aligned with those they represent.It is businesses that really need to prepare for trading across the Channel according to World Trade Organisation rules, which mean 2 per cent tariffs on most goods but 10 per cent on cars and 20 per cent on agricultural products. Customs barriers will also spring up, increase costs and slow down deliveries.Last year, Dr Wen Chen of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and his international team of collaborators analysed which regions in EU countries were most exposed to Brexit. Because of the deep level of the data, this is probably the best analysis of the exposure to date.His calculations, however, assume that Brexit will set British-EU trade to zero (there's no other way to get at the full share of gross domestic product that could potentially be affected). In real life, though, a 2 per cent tariff, slightly longer delivery times and the added cost of Customs clearance - estimated, for example, at \u20ac500 million (S$785.8 million) a year for Germany, the EU's biggest economy - will not affect trade volumes much. The economic actors who really do need to prepare for a cliff-edge Brexit are primarily in the auto industry, agriculture and finance, where British and European firms would be cut off from operating in each other's markets directly by the end of passporting.In the financial services industry, a no-deal Brexit is considered a serious threat. In March, the global Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), whose members work in the entire range of financial companies and banks, published the results of a Brexit-themed survey. Three-quarters of its participants work outside Britain; 77 per cent of those asked said a hard Brexit would be damaging to their business; and 6 per cent said their firms would no longer have a viable business model.At the same time, preparations have been going too slowly: 23 per cent of the ACCA members (and 31 per cent of those working in small firms) said their companies had not even begun planning for Brexit. Only 8 per cent said they had begun to implement their plans, a measly 3 percentage point increase from March 2016.That would appear to make the financial services industry a particularly important audience for the upcoming EU warning. A just-released Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on the EU downplays the risk - but still notes the potential that a lack of preparedness can cause adverse consequences.\"EU entities will probably retain sufficient access to wholesale and retail financial services post-Brexit, as most financial services are currently already provided in the EU-27 and relevant UK entities can relocate part of their activities to other EU member states,\" said the OECD. \"On the other hand, moving from wholesale banking centred in London to a potentially more fragmented banking landscape might increase the cost of capital for households and non-financial corporations, as the economies of scale and scope of the London industry may diminish.\"It's somewhat harder for industrial and agricultural firms to Brexit-proof their operations. Finding other markets for products can be a tough task. According to Deloitte, a hard Brexit would cut German car exports to Britain by 255,000 a year, worth about \u20ac6.7 billion or 5 per cent of sales. About 18,000 jobs would be endangered. European automakers in total would lose about \u20ac8.7 billion in sales. Car-part sales would not be hurt as badly because the tariff on them would be 4.5 per cent, not 10 per cent as for cars, but thousands of jobs could still evaporate as imports from the rest of the world become more economically viable for Britain.A survey of German enterprises by the national association of industry and commerce chambers, published earlier this year, showed that only 14 per cent of firms considered themselves well prepared for Brexit's consequences. In particular, the German car industry, the biggest potential loser, is heavily invested in pushing the government and the EU to make a deal. It has assumed too much, and it should focus more on no-deal preparations.The Irish government and Ireland's agricultural producers, who stand to lose 39 per cent of their exports - worth \u20ac4.8 billion a year - if Britain leaves without a deal, also hope for a favourable outcome, but at least they are working visibly to get ready for a cliff-edge Brexit. The Irish Agriculture Ministry has sent special missions to Japan, South Korea, the United States, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with a view to shifting some of the exports to those places. And some firms are already changing their product mix to suit new markets, retooling, for example, to produce Norwegian Jarlsberg cheese for the US and Australia rather than cheddar for Britain.Not believing in the possibility of a no-deal outcome could cost businesses billions of dollars in lost revenue. Regardless of whether Britain and the EU are only playing a game, it is a dangerous one. The quality of the players on the British side and the EU's multitude of other concerns make the worst outcome entirely possible. So all the warnings the parties issue as they try not to blink should be taken extremely seriously.

The government's proposal was passed without a vote.Mrs May adopted a high-risk strategy by directly facing off with rebels in her Conservative Party, and it seemed to pay off. One lawmaker said Mrs May had had no option but to take on the rebels or risk their rebellion growing.But the battle may be a taste of things to come. Mrs May needs to get several Bills through Parliament to prepare Britain for life outside the European Union.Some of her opponents on Brexit may simply have decided to keep their powder dry for later fights on issues such as future trading ties with the bloc.Mr Grieve had led the potential rebellion over Mrs May's proposal - to offer Parliament a statement setting out what she will do if she fails to negotiate an agreement with the EU, or if lawmakers reject any deal she returns with.But after days of lobbying by Conservative officials that Parliament should not tie the government's hands in the Brexit talks and that lawmakers were handing an advantage to the EU, Mr Grieve seemed to have put his concerns aside.Mr Grieve said he now saw he needed to take account of Mrs May's concerns over the state of the negotiations, which have all but stalled because of divisions in her government.While Mrs May won the day, the high-stakes vote is a reminder of how difficult her situation is.Her Conservative Party commands only a slim majority in the 650-seat Commons and relies on the support of Northern Ireland's 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs.In a sign of how close yesterday's vote was, heavily pregnant and sick MPs were called in to cast their ballots, including one in a wheelchair.REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSEWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

This is basically just an insurance policy for now.\"President Jean-Claude Juncker gave British staff a formal undertaking in late March that the Commission would not exercise its right to dismiss them after March 29, 2019, when they lose the EU citizenship that is a normal requirement for employment.But despite such sympathy at the top for their plight, Britons have already been voting with their feet.Public data shows that on January 1 this year there were 894 Commission employees whose officially recorded first nationality was British. That was down 135, or 13 per cent, from a year earlier and 240, or 21 per cent, fewer than at the start of 2016.Internal data cited by an EU official showed that since May 2016 \"slightly above 150\" Britons retired, resigned or left at the end of the kind of temporary contract given to a quarter of the Commission's 32,000 staff; some 65 British citizens were hired, but all but four of these were on short-term contracts.NEW PASSPORTSStrikingly, compared to that net decline of 85, \"slightly above 100\" more Britons also switched their \"first nationality\"to another of the 27 EU states, notably to Ireland, where many millions of British people have roots, as well as to France.In a tweet sent on the day after the Brexit vote devastated his colleagues, one British EU official with dual nationality posted a photo of a bottle of Irish whiskey.He wrote: \"Time to connect with my Irishness to numb my wounded Britishness.\"Britain allows dual nationality, so those switching in the EU are not obliged to renounce their private UK citizenship.Conversations with EU officials - none would speak on the record about personal choices - shows some Britons already had dual citizenship and have merely switched to the \"first nationality\" recorded in Commission records.Some raced to acquire new passports after the referendum. Others also have another citizenship but have yet to formally switch to it, while many are thinking of or are applying to other countries.Among these, notably, is Belgium. It has resisted granting citizenship to some EU officials, despite many having spent decades living in Brussels, on the grounds they have not been in the local tax system.Juncker appealed personally to the Belgian prime minister this month to show them compassion.The issue of nationality in EU careers is a delicate one. Formally, officials \"leave their passports at the door\", though officials also expect teams to reflect the bloc's diversity.A Commission spokeswoman told Reuters: \"We can't see how changing first nationality ... could result in any sort of advantage. Promotions of EU officials are based on merit only.\"Even before Brexit, that view is contested by some who say privately that British colleagues have been passed over for expected promotions or removed from work that superiors feared could cause a conflict of loyalties between Brussels and London.Some British EU staff say that has offended them, arguing that, if anything, they feel the Brexit vote has strengthened their commitment to a project people back home have abandoned.\"It's been painful,\" said one veteran staffer. \"Since the referendum, I feel much less British - but the world sees me as much less European,\"STIFF UPPER LIPEven those switching passports see little hope - certainly not in senior positions, where national governments are unlikely to lobby for what one Irish official described as \"re-badged Brits\". Like other capitals, Dublin wants jobs for its own.The number of Commission officials recording Irish first nationality rose by 37 to 520 in the two years to January.An Irish EU embassy spokesman said the issue of British EU officials taking Irish nationality was \"complex\" and that the government was \"continuing to monitor matters\".Even without Brexit, Euro-Brits have been a vanishing breed, reflecting what many of them see as long growing indifference to the EU among British voters and successive London governments.While they once made up closer to the 13 per cent of the current EU population that Britain accounts for, they are today just 3 per cent of Commission, albeit better represented in the senior ranks, reflecting longer EU membership than most states and more effort to see \"national balance\" across the top jobs.Some British staffers speak of serving out time till their pension; others are sticking to EU ambitions, knowing that the Commission does hire some non-EU nationals with special skills.Rather than linger in roles of diminishing responsibility, some are looking to follow colleagues into the private sector.A few are tempted to move to a London civil service that may grow thanks to Brexit; others see little welcome from a British establishment they feel has done little for them.Amid anger, grief and uncertainty, there is deal of British stiff upper lip: \"It's not the end of the world,\" said one.\"No one's going to be helicoptered off the embassy roof, Saigon-style.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

While there would be \"no tariffs on any goods\", Britain's vast services sector will suffer significant disruption. Banks in particular will lose their current access to the EU market, as the government gives up on its earlier plan for both sides to recognise each other's regulations.Mrs May faces a huge task trying to persuade EU negotiators to accept that the proposals are viable, while also keeping her Conservative party and Parliament on side. Time is running out to reach an exit agreement by the self-imposed October deadline, and Mrs May's plan has nothing new about the critical issue that is holding up progress: Avoiding customs checks at the border with Ireland.Even United States President Donald Trump took a view. Hours before he is due to touch down in Britain, he lobbed a verbal hand grenade at his host, saying Mrs May is not giving voters the Brexit deal they wanted.\"I would say Brexit is Brexit,\" Mr Trump said on Thursday at a news conference at the Nato summit in Brussels.\"The people voted to break it up so I would imagine that's what they would do, but maybe they're taking a different route - I don't know if that is what they voted for.\"Mrs May appealed to European negotiators to \"engage\" with her blueprint in the same spirit of respect that she said her government was taking toward the EU's own principles and red lines.\"Our proposal is comprehensive. It is ambitious. And it strikes the balance we need - between rights and obligations,\" Mrs May wrote in the foreword to the white paper.\"It would deliver a principled and practical Brexit that is in our national interest, and the UK's and the EU's mutual interest.\"Britain has also set out a complicated structure for supervision of the new relationship that would allow the two sides to discuss rule tweaks and include a mechanism for solving disputes.The British prime minister, European leaders and ministers would establish a \"governing body\" to set the direction of the future relationship, while a joint committee of officials would provide the day-to-day running of the agreement.Crucially, in a move that could anger Brexiteers, if there is a dispute over the interpretation of EU rules that Britain has agreed to adhere to, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) could have the final say.Details in the document include:- Britain will mirror EU rules for goods, as well as collecting tariffs on behalf of the bloc. In a sign of the imbalance in the relationship, Mrs May is not proposing the EU collect tariffs on behalf of Britain.- Britain proposes setting up new arrangements to allow it to have a voice - but not a vote - when EU introduces new regulations, and to facilitate the customs arrangement.- On rules of origin which govern whether goods are treated as EU-made, Britain is asking for no changes to current arrangements. This is crucial for manufacturers including car-makers, who otherwise face tariffs when exporting to the EU.- White paper sets out the parliamentary process after a deal has been agreed with the EU, and makes it clear that it will be conditional on support from lawmakers.- Britain wants to keep participating in EU agencies covering chemicals, aviation and medicines. It also proposed a close cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency and new arrangements for a closer association with the Euratom nuclear regulator than any other non-EU country.- Britain acknowledges its position on cooperation over the \u20ac10 billion (S$15.9 billion) Galileo satellite navigation programme is at odds with that of the EU. It maintains it wants to retain involvement in the project, in particular its Public Regulated Service - the encrypted navigation used for government and defence purpose, which the EU wants to exclude Britain from.- On immigration, the document says Britain will continue to be \"open and tolerant\", while ending the free movement of people. It stops short of saying EU citizens will be prioritised in any future immigration system.- Britain will also seek to ensure British and EU citizens can still use each other's health services when abroad, and foreign residents can still access their pension entitlements. Irish citizens will enjoy \"special status\" distinct from that of other EU nationals.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

It involves Britain weaving its customs regime around the bloc's rules, and adopting identical regulations for industrial and agri-food goods.There was no such design for close ties for Britain's huge services sector, and London-based banks were warned they will lose their current levels of access to the EU market. New arrangements will seek to preserve the \"mutual benefits of integrated markets\".\"Today, in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,\" Mrs May said in a statement released by her office, with talks ongoing. \"Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve\".The plan represents a closer relationship to the EU single market than many pro-Brexit campaigners hoped for when Mrs May first set out her plans in January last year.The EU's chief negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier, said the bloc would assess the plans when they are fleshed out in a policy paper next week, to \"see if they are workable and realistic\".Uniting her Cabinet was a big win for Mrs May, after two years of very public splits. In a letter to members of her Conservative party, she said she had allowed ministers to speak out before, but \"collective responsibility is now fully restored\".Several euro-sceptic ministers yesterday publicly backed the premier, including leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. Pro-European MPs who had previously rebelled against Mrs May also offered their support for the plan, with Ms Anna Soubry saying it \"delivers a business-friendly Brexit\".Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Douglas Carswell, who co-founded the official Brexit campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, gave his backing.\"Read the detail and ask if this allows us to take back control.

only for two top ministers to quit in protest at its provisions to adopt EU rules on trade in goods.The plan foresees an overall \"association agreement\" with the EU encompassing different deals on different areas.Here are the key points:TRADE IN GOODSBritain and the EU would maintain a \"common rulebook\" for goods to ensure smooth trade including in agricultural, food and fisheries products.In eliminating tariffs, quotas and rules of origin requirements, it would protect supply chains that criss-cross the EU and just-in-time processes vital to, for example, the automotive industry.It would also avoid border checks between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.Britain and the EU would agree any new rules through joint technical committees, and parliament would reserve the right to reject them, while accepting consequences for market access.Britain believes it can have this free trade area as well as an independent trade policy, where it sets its own tariffs on products from outside the EU.It would use technology to apply British tariffs to goods intended for Britain, and the EU's tariffs on those intended for the bloc.This would be phased in but officials insist it can be operational before the end of a post-Brexit transition period planned to last until December 2020.Britain would leave the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.FINANCIAL SERVICESAround \u00a31.4 trillion (US$1.85 billion) of assets are managed in Britain for European clients, the government's \"white paper\" notes, and the City hosts most of the EU's trading for banks and insurance companies.The paper concedes that City firms will lose their \"passporting\" rights to operate freely across the EU, once Britain exits the single market.But it also says that because of the deep cross-Channel links, \"equivalence\" is not good enough either.That refers to special bilateral arrangements already used by financial firms from Wall Street, Japan and China, whereby they agree to meet EU rules to keep access to the common market.Therefore, it calls for a hybrid arrangement that would adopt equivalence but also recognise \"extensive supervisory cooperation and regulatory dialogue\" between Britain's financial watchdogs and their EU counterparts.Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation, called it a \"real blow\" for the City.EUROPEAN COURTThe EU and Britain would establish a political governing body and an official-level technical committee to oversee the deal.Direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would end, with all disagreements enforced in Britain by British courts, although they would pay \"due regard\" to EU case law.Both sides would need to agree a means of resolving disputes, including through binding independent arbitration.MIGRATIONBritain would end free movement of people from the EU, and parliament would decide on any future immigration plans, but would seek reciprocal \"mobility arrangements\" with the bloc.It wants to support businesses to move staff between the two territories, allow mobility for students and young people, and allow citizens to travel without visas for tourism and temporary business activity.Any deal should also include arrangements ensuring that Britons retiring to EU countries have access to their pensions and healthcare.STANDARDS AND COMPETITION\u00a0Britain would legally commit to a common rulebook on state aid rules, and establish \"cooperative arrangements\" on competition.Both sides would agree to maintain high regulatory standards in areas such as environment and employment.SECURITYBritain wants a new treaty allowing it to continue using EU internal security measures such as the European Arrest Warrant and to participate in agencies such as Europol.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "EU warns Britain 'time is short' to reach Brexit deal", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "BRUSSELS: The European Union warned Friday (Jun 29) that Britain was running out of time to get a deal on Brexit, as leaders agreed to step up preparations for the possibility that talks collapse.Meeting without Prime Minister Theresa May on the second day of a Brussels summit, the other 27 EU leaders requested \"further clarity\" from her divided government on what it wants.Britain is hoping to agree a withdrawal deal and the outline terms of a future trading and security partnership by October, ahead of Brexit in March 2019.Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said progress had been made but there remained \"serious divergence\" on the question of how to avoid checks on the Irish border after Brexit.He said he hoped a forthcoming policy paper from London would \"contain workable and realistic proposals\" for the negotiations.\"But let me mention once again that time is very short. We want a deal and are working for a deal, but time is short,\" he said.He invited British negotiators back to Brussels next Monday.As May left the summit in the early hours, after all-night talks on migration, she confirmed she wanted the talks to step up a gear.\"We are ready to intensify and accelerate the pace of negotiations, I want to see that from the European Commission and the European Union as well,\" she said.The summit was originally viewed as a crucial point in the Brexit process, but it was sidelined due to the lack of progress and an EU row over how to deal with irregular migration.'NO DEAL' PREPARATIONSIn their summit conclusions, the other 27 leaders expressed \"concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved\" on the Irish issue.And they called on member states \"to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes\".Britain has said it will walk away from the talks if it cannot get a favourable deal, but says it expects an agreement.Critics say that in reality, Britain is ill-prepared for a \"no deal\" scenario.The negotiations have been stalled on how to avoid border checks between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain.London wants to leave the EU's customs union and single market but has yet to explain how this will not result in a \"hard\" Irish border, the prospect of which has sparked fears for the fragile peace on the island.Irish premier Leo Varadkar expressed disappointment at the summit on Thursday over the lack of progress, and warned Britain must be prepared to give ground on some of its demands.\"Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn't going to be one of absolute equals,\" he said.May has called for a bespoke trade deal with the EU after Brexit, but has yet to set out the details amid government in-fighting over how close to stay aligned with the bloc's rules.She will gather her warring ministers at her country retreat next week, likely Friday, to thrash out a deal and publish her policy paper shortly afterwards.Her government is clear on one area - the need for close security ties with the EU after Brexit.But Brussels has warned Britain cannot maintain the same access to EU-only police databases and institutions.Over a summit dinner late Thursday, May urged leaders to rip up the rule book, saying they

8) in a major blow for Prime Minister Theresa May as she tries to unite her party behind a plan to retain strong economic ties to the European Union even after leaving the bloc.\"The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one,\" Davis said in a letter to May.British media reported that junior Brexit minister Steve Baker had also stepped down.The resignations come two days after the cabinet approved the plan in a bid to unblock negotiations with Brussels at a meeting at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers outside London.Davis said the plan would \"make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real\".He was particularly critical of the proposal for a \"common rulebook\" to allow free trade in goods, saying this \"hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense\".\"I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions,\" he said, concluding that his post required \"an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript\".May replied in a letter saying that her Brexit plan \"will undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels to the United Kingdom\" and was in line with her commitment to leave the European single market and customs union.\"I would like to thank you warmly for everything you have done over the past two years as Secretary of State to shape our departure from the EU,\" she said.\"BREXIT IN NAME ONLY\"A long-time eurosceptic, Davis was appointed two years ago to head up the newly-created Department for Exiting the European Union after Britain voted to leave the European Union in a historic referendum.He became the face of Brexit, leading the British delegation in talks with Brussels, although his role was overshadowed in recent months as May and her aides took an increasingly key role in the negotiations.The 69-year-old had reportedly threatened to quit several times over a perceived lack of firmness in Britain's negotiating stance but had remained strictly loyal to the prime minister in public.The resignation comes just hours before May was due in parliament to explain her plan for Britain to adopt EU rules on goods after Brexit, amid anger from MPs in her own party who want a cleaner break.Conservative MP Peter Bone said Davis had \"done the right thing\", adding: \"The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.\"Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: \"This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.\"May's plan would create a free trade area with the EU for goods, to protect supply chains in areas such as manufacturing, while maintaining flexibility for Britain's dominant service sector.It is unclear whether Brussels will accept this, after repeatedly warning Britain it cannot \"cherry-pick\" bits of its single market.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit supporter, was widely reported to have described the plan as a \"turd\" before agreeing to support it.SPECIAL FORCES TRAININGDavis, a sharp operator and a gut-instinct politician, was a \"Leave\" campaigner in the referendum on Britain's EU membership.He was well acquainted with the Brussels beat: he was Europe minister between 1994 and 1997 as the European issue tore apart then Conservative prime minister John Major's government.Born to a single mother and brought up on a public housing estate in London, Davis went on to study molecular and computer sciences at Warwick University in central England.From there, he took a higher degree in business at the London Business School, attending the advanced management programme at elite US university Harvard while pursuing a career on the board of sugar giant Tate and Lyle.Davis also served as a reservist in the Special Air Service, the British army's elite special force unit.Noted for his love of climbing and flying, his ascent in politics began in 1987 when he was elected to parliament, representing a seat in northern England.He became a government whip ensuring party discipline and later, as Major's Europe minister, delighted in the nickname \"Monsieur Non\".Davis then chaired the powerful public accounts committee in the lower House of Commons from 1997 to 2001.He ran for the Conservative leadership in 2001 and came fourth, but was made party chairman.Davis was the front-runner in the 2005 Conservative Party leadership contest, but lost out to David Cameron, shedding momentum after a party conference speech fell flat.He stayed on as the party's home affairs spokesman, but dramatically resigned his seat to force a by-election in protest at the Labour government's erosion of civil liberties.He won the seat back but the move cost him his place in Cameron's top team.When the Conservatives returned to power in 2010, he never got a government post and spent his time on the backbenches campaigning on civil liberties issues.When Cameron resigned after defeat in the Brexit referendum, Davis was appointed back in government by May, Cameron's replacement.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "UK to warn public every week over 'no-deal Brexit': Report", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "LONDON:

If opposition parties join them, May would have a major crisis on her hands.At the same time, the prime minister is also testing her plan with the EU, as Brexit negotiations resumed in Brussels on Monday.SPLIT THE PARTYMay spent the weekend defending her plan, and did so again in a speech at Farnborough airshow Monday, insisting it would protect trade in goods with the EU and avoid border checks in Ireland.She said it would allow Britain to control migration, end the jurisdiction of EU courts and forge its own trade policy - despite US President Donald Trump saying the prime minister's plan could \"kill\" a US-UK trade deal.Eurosceptics believe it keeps Britain too close to the EU, and Davis, the former Brexit secretary, warned in the Financial Times on Monday it would deny the government the \"freedom to run our own economy\".\"It would be profoundly dangerous to leave the EU but remain subject to regulations made by institutions in which we have no say,\" he wrote.In an article in the Mail on Sunday, May urged eurosceptics to keep their \"eyes on the prize\", warning: \"If we don't, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\"Rees-Mogg, the leader of the powerful European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs, said May still had time to change course and warned the current plan would split the party.\"The inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it to keep the party united,\" he told BBC television.Pro-Europeans also dislike May's plan, particular her goal to have looser ties with the EU for Britain's dominant services sector.A cross-party group of MPs have tabled amendments to Monday's bill - the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, also known as the customs bill - seeking a new customs union with the EU.But one MP told AFP they would likely not push it to a vote on Monday, instead waiting to see what the eurosceptics do.They can hold their fire for Tuesday when the same amendment is tabled to a separate trade bill.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "EU trying to 'swindle' UK in Brexit talks: Report", "classes": ["newsletter__message"], "content": "LONDON: Italy's far right deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini has accused the European Union of attempting to \"swindle\" the United Kingdom out of the Brexit people voted for in the landmark 2016 referendum, The Sunday Times reported.\"My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you\", Salvini told the weekly as he urged prime minister Theresa May to take a harder stance in negotiations to sever ties with the trading bloc.May and her ministers are scrambling to forge agreements with each of the EU's 27 member states after a week which saw her already fragile \"Chequers plan\" for Brexit knocked back by Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier.On Thursday (Jul 26), Barnier rejected May's plan to keep the border between EU member Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland open, with a dual system of taxes levied by each side for the benefit of the other.But League party leader Salvini has urged May to consider taking a hard line, potentially leaving the EU without securing a deal. \"Because on some principles there is no need to be flexible and you should not go backwards,? he told The Times.The paper said he also implied the EU is attempting to punish Britain for seeking to leave, claiming: \"There is no objectivity or good faith from the European side.\"\"I hope the negotiations end well for the UK to serve as an example of the people coming out on top of the EU,\" he added.\"I remember the referendum stage as an example of participation and freedom; I hope it can be an opportunity for the British.\"Barnier has attempted to scupper May's plan to circumvent Brussels in striking a deal with the member states, insisting that there is not a \"sliver of difference\" between him and the 27 nation leaders.But according to The Times Salvini has said he would welcome one-on-one talks with May, undermining Barnier's authority as the head of talks.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid."}{"head": "\nNews Analysis: Could a no-deal Brexit become reality? \n", "classes": [], "content": "LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- At least one major London newspaper has carried a feature guiding its readers what to stockpile in the event of Britain crashing out of the European Union with no trade deal.As an island country, Britain relies heavily on imported food which accounts for half of what the 65 million population eat.A no-deal has fuelled fears that fresh and perishable foods could rot during delays at British sea ports and airports. It could lead to panic buying in the shops as people hedge their bets and stockpile tinned and long-life foods \"just in case\".With growing concern about the fate of Prime Minister Theresa May's blueprint for a future trade deal with the EU, people from the proverbial \"man in the street\" to politicians and academics are posing the question, could a no-deal scenario become a reality.Time is running out as Britain heads towards March 29, 2019, the day the country ceases to be an EU member.Leave supporting Conservative MPs are planning a number of amendments to upcoming related legislation due to be debated in the coming weeks in the House of Commons.With May heading a minority government, her Brexit plans have to be navigated through potentially stormy waters in parliament, and also clear hurdles not only with EU negotiators in Brussels but with the other 27 member states.One-time adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, macroeconomist Patrick Minford, Professor of Applied Economics at Cardiff Business School, told Xinhua Friday: \"I really cannot see the May proposals as viable at all. Either a No Deal or a retreat to a Canada plus deal seem only possible outcomes.\"Minford cited fury among Conservative ranks as another issue for May.Meanwhile, Professor Anthony Glees, Director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, warned the chaotic political situation in Britain could lead to further chaos.Glees told Xinhua: \"What my sources indicate (and I've just attended a meeting is that the Chequers agreement is really still a compromise between the Remain and Brexit wings of the Cabinet. It has allowed both to sign up to the deal, but as a practical proposal and workable plan it is fraught with problems.\"He said Britain will have to decide either to leave the EU altogether or effectively stay in, extending the 'Common Rule Book' to services as well as goods, that is to the 80 percent of the economy and not just the 20 percent of it.\"Why give car manufacturing advantages over financial services, for example, added Glees. \"This just does not make sense, is unfair and will lead big financial services to pull out of the UK, full stop. So if we do this deal on goods, it'll have to be on services as well.\"What that will mean is that Britain either leaves, full stop, or stays in but without any ability to shape the rules, he said.Glees added: \"At the moment, despite this not being what most of the two sides want, the most likely outcome seems to be a hard and even a cliff-edge Brexit, what the Brexit ideologues would call a 'diamond Brexit'. That in turn would lead to twenty years of upheaval and a massive decline in the wealth and the standard of living of the people of the UK. Did the 52 percent vote for that? I don't think so.\"Glees said when the newly published White Paper states that \"exit from the EU will provide considerable additional opportunities for British business through potentially ambitious new trade arrangements and meaningful trade deals that play to the strengths of the UK economy', this is so clearly the best civil servants could do with what was in essence a totally bad job. These words mean nothing hard, they are basically platitudes.Glees said he believes May now wants to take the best possible alternative available, a negotiation based on Chequers but which allows the EU27 to make significant inroads into it in return for further concessions on services, and call it 'Brexit'.\"She will try to explain that this is, in fact, what the 52 percent voted, nothing less than leaving the EU but nothing more either,\" said Glees.

Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs were quick to voice their concerns.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is leader of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservatives, told the BBC early morning Today program: \"It is possible that this deal is worse than a no deal Brexit.\"Rees-Mogg, once spoken of as a successor to May as prime minister, said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals, adding: \"If it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative party's manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.\"Media reports Saturday said May had told her cabinet ministers they were now have to adhere to the convention of cabinet responsibility. This would prevent any of them from speaking against the proposals agreed at her Chequers meeting. It was also seen, according to the media, as a stark warning to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that he would lose his job is he makes any outspoken comments.John Longworth, one-time director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and co-chairman of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, pulled no punches with his message, saying: \"Those who campaigned for Leave but have not resigned will see their reputations in tatters.\"Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Longworth accused May of totally misleading the 17.4 million British people who voted leave, \"and left it as late as possible to reveal that she remains a stubborn Remainer\".\"We are faced with becoming a vassal state of the EU, they have us exactly where they want us - unable to compete, taking enormous quantities of their products at inflated prices, protected from global competition by the fortress Europe tariff and regulatory wall and impeded from doing trade deals around the globe,\" added Longworth.Elsewhere there was a sigh of relief that the government finally had a proposed deal to present to Brussels.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, who is Leader of the House of Commons, said on her social media site: \"As a passionate Brexiteer with huge optimism about future as a free trading nation, I agree with the PM (May) that keeping the UK together is vital.

The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the British automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership,\" the spokesperson added.\"There is no credible Plan B for frictionless customs arrangements, nor is it realistic to expect that new trade deals can be agreed with the rest of the world that will replicate the immense value of trade with the EU. Government must rethink its position on the customs union.\"Earlier on Thursday the largest British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) issued a bleak warning on the dangers of an unsatisfactory Brexit trade deal.Dr Ralf Speth, JLR chief executive, warned that uncertainty over trading arrangements with the EU threatened future investment plans by JLR in Britain.\"We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees,\" Speth warned.He added: \"A bad Brexit deal would cost JLR more than 1.2 billion pounds (1.59 billion U.S. dollars) profit each year.\"As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile; we have spent around 50 billion pounds in Britain in the past five years with plans for a further 80 billion pounds in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.\"JLR, a British subsidiary of Indian Motor firm Tata Motors, makes about 600,000 cars a year, the largest total of all British car firms, and its largest export market is the EU.The JLR warning comes after a similar bleak warning at the end of June from Airbus, the aeroplane manufacturer, which has significant operations in Britain, where it has several factories which specialize in the high technology production of wings.Airbus warned that it employs 14,000 workers in Britain and supports up to 100,000 other jobs, but these could be under threat if its sophisticated cross-border supply-chains were disrupted by tariff payments and delays with documentation under post-Brexit trade arrangements.

Instead high ranking negotiators from both sides will seek a way through the current deadlock.On Friday the negotiations will switch to a proposed future relationship between Britain and the EU's remaining 27 member states after next March.Meanwhile, new figures Monday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the Irish Republic accounts for 27 percent of Northern Ireland's international export trade. The United States accounted for 25 percent, making it Northern Ireland's second biggest international export partner.Northern Ireland's biggest export across the border into Ireland was food and live animals, particularly dairy products, which represented 33 percent of total exports to the Irish Republic.More than two thirds (68 percent) of exporting businesses in Northern Ireland were small companies employing up to 49 workers.Commentators in Britain and Ireland have warned that a no-deal Brexit could have serious consequences for industries that have extensive cross-border supply chains.Last month May made her first visit to the Irish border since the 2016 Brexit referendum. She held talks with workers and business representatives from both sides of the border.During her two-day visit May reaffirmed her commitment to a Brexit that avoids a hard border and protects the Belfast Agreement which brought to an end decades of conflict and troubles in Northern Ireland.In a government white paper Britain has ruled out any kind of hard border.\"Daily journeys will continue to be seamless and there will be no checks or infrastructure at the border to get in the way of this,\" said May.\"I've also been clear we will not accept the imposition of any border down the Irish Sea and we will preserve the integrity of the UK's internal market and Northern Ireland's place within it,\" she added.Media reports in Brussels said later that EU negotiator Barnier had rejected key elements of Britain's new trade proposals outlined in May's blueprint for a future post-Brexit trading relationship with the bloc.Barnier made clear British offers to collect customs duties for the EU as part of efforts to avoid friction on Northern Ireland's new EU border had failed to convince already skeptical Europeans.Both sides are aiming to have draft deal in place by October, but observers fear a no-deal outcome is looking increasingly possible.Last week Britain's international trade secretary Liam Fox said the chance of a no-deal Brexit is growing, blaming the \"intransigence\" of the European Commission. Fox put the chance of failing to come to an agreement at \"60-40\", but 10 Downing Street has insisted the British government remains confident it can get a good deal with Brussels.

So, on the protocol on Northern Ireland, I want to be very clear ... there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,\" she said.May's Monday statement came amid infighting among lawmakers.

He said he did not expect the bill, or another key bill on trade due to be debated on Tuesday, to be blocked outright by the 650-member parliament.\"I'm sure Theresa May does not want to split the Conservative Party and therefore she will find that the inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it (the Brexit policy) to keep the party united,\" Rees-Mogg said.\"We'll have an idea of the numbers, I suppose, at 10 o'clock on Monday evening.\"Reuters\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          UK Tory party hit by new round of Brexit turmoil\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "Theresa May defiant after resignations of senior euroskeptic cabinet ministersThe relationship between China and the United Kingdom is developing well and will not be impacted by turbulence in Britain\u2019s domestic political situation, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday after a day of resignations and acrimony in the British Parliament.Hua said Beijing will continue to value its ties with London and work with the UK to enhance them.Her comments followed the resignations on Sunday night and on Monday of the UK\u2019s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, and its chief Brexit negotiator, David Davis, as well as some junior figures. They walked off the job because they disagreed with Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s vision of Britain\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the European Union following their March 2019 separation.Johnson and Davis, both enthusiastic supporters of the Leave campaign in Britain\u2019s 2016 referendum on EU membership, favor a clean break and arms-length relationship, while May recently revealed her preference for a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and close future ties. May has given Johnson\u2019s old job to Jeremy Hunt, who had been health secretary. Davis\u2019s role will be handled by former housing minister Dominic Raab.The nation will now wait to see whether the turmoil is over, or if there will be further resignations and disquiet within the Conservative Party and whether there will be a leadership challenge.May passed the first test when she chaired a meeting of her reshuffled cabinet at 10 Downing Street.She is now calling on her party to unite, or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn and his opposition Labour Party grabbing power.If May is to face a leadership challenge, it must be mounted through the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, which comprises ordinary Conservative Party MPs. The committee could demand a \u201cno-confidence\u201d vote if 15 percent of the party\u2019s MPs, currently 48 people, officially call for one.So far, no such challenge has been mounted and the BBC\u2019s assistant political editor, Norman Smith, says it looks as if discontented Tory MPs would rather negotiate with May than bring down her government.\u201cThere is a genuine weariness (and) horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program on Tuesday.Former Conservative Party leader Michael Howard said on the same program that it would be \u201cextremely foolish and extremely ill-advised\u201d if Tory MPs triggered a leadership contest.\u201cAnd I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out,\u201d he added.Professor Jon Tonge from the University of Liverpool, told Xinhua news agency that May would probably win a leadership challenge anyway, if one was to materialize.Meanwhile, Malcolm Rifkind, who served as a cabinet minister under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, said in an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper that he is \u201crelaxed\u201d about the resignations and more optimistic than he has been for a long time that a good Brexit agreement is within reach.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was not as charitable, saying Johnson and Davis had abandoned a \u201csinking ship\u201d and that the Tory Party was bitterly divided.Xinhua said May had told a rowdy House of Commons in the wake of the resignations that Johnson and Davis were wrong in their assessments of what the British people want from Brexit negotiations.She said the soft Brexit she favors is \u201cthe Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people, and it is the right Brexit deal for Britain\u201d.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          Queen Elizabeth gives Royal Assent to Britain's Brexit bill\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "LONDON - The first major piece of legislation to pave the way for Britain's exit from the European Union became law Tuesday after it was given the Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II.Brexit director David Davis welcomed the move, saying it marked the next essential step in ensuring that Britain is ready for life after leaving the European Union next March.The Queen's signature in the European Union Withdrawal Bill means it is now official British legislation.The act gives Prime Minister Theresa May's government the power to transfer thousands of pieces of EU legislation into British law after Brexit.The law will also repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which took Britain into the EU and meant that European law took precedence over laws passed in the UK Parliament.The so-called Brexit bill endured a roller-coaster ride as it went through the legislative and parliamentary processes in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.Members in the unelected upper chamber voted in favor of a number of amendments, threatening the success of May's Brexit bill, described as the most important new law since the end of World War II.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          British applications for German citizenship continue to soar after Brexit\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "BERLIN - The number of Britons obtaining citizenship in Germany rose significantly for a second consecutive year since Britain decided to leave the European Union (EU) in June 2016, official figures from the Federal Statistical Office showed Wednesday.According to the Federal Statistical Office, 7,493 Britons obtained German citizenship in 2017, marking a 162 percent increase compared to the previous record year.Between 2015 and 2016, British applications for citizenship of the EU's largest economy already quadrupled.The Federal Statistical Office noted that only 5,092 Brits obtained German citizenship in the 15 years prior to 2015, suggesting that concerns surrounding Brexit were a major factor contributing to the upward trend.In a recent report, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) warned that Britain was already experiencing negative economic effects from its decision to leave the bloc. The country has been the worst performing economy in the EU in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2016.BDI director Dieter Kempf said Britain would be best advised to emulate the quasi-EU membership models of Norway and Switzerland to avert further economic harm and protect the current rights which its own citizens enjoy throughout the EU.Though not member states of the EU, Norway and Switzerland are both members of the EU Schengen travel area and customs union, abide by its four freedoms of goods, services, capital and people, and are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (CJEU).So far, London has rejected all of these propositions and instead called for developing a vague \"bespoke\" agreement with the EU. However, the European Commission and European heads of state are increasingly skeptical about the feasibility and desirability of such an outcome.A key sticking point in negotiations remains the land border between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU after Brexit, and the UK's Northern Ireland, an issue on which the British cabinet is also split internally.The extent to which Britain continues to mirror EU regulations after Brexit will have far-reaching implications for British citizens and could potentially eliminate their right to move freely throughout the bloc in search of work.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          75% of Brexit agreement already negotiated: Bulgarian FM\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "SOFIA - Some 75 percent of the agreement on Britain's exit from the European Union (EU) has already been negotiated, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva said here on Tuesday.In the first phase of the negotiations, it was agreed to guarantee the rights of all European citizens, a topic that was a priority for her country, Zaharieva said at a discussion about the impact of Brexit on the EU and Bulgaria.An agreement has also been reached on Britain's financial commitments, with London participating in the EU budget by the end of the current seven-year programming period -- 2020, Zaharieva said.The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remained a serious issue, she said.Due to Brexit, the UK would leave 750 agreements with the EU, and this would undoubtedly affect all spheres of public life, Zaharieva said.\"It is very important to ensure predictability and security for EU citizens and businesses,\" said Zaharieva, who is also Bulgaria's deputy prime minister.According to Zaharieva, the EU-UK relations should not be limited to a free trade agreement.Cooperation should be sought in security, foreign policy and defense, as well in the social sphere, with a focus on labor mobility, culture and education, she said.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          Let public vote on final Brexit deal, says new UK campaign\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "LONDON -- A new campaign group, backed by a star from the Star Trek movies, was launched Sunday calling for a public vote on a final Brexit deal.The People's Vote campaign, which held its launch event in Camden, London, is backed by high-profile MPs from the major political parties, business leaders and celebrities, including the British star, Sir Patrick Stewart, who played Captin Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation.Britain is due to end its membership of the European Union next March, with both the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour parties rejecting calls for a second referendum.In the first referendum in June 2016, Britain voted by a 52-48 margin to leave the EU.Nine grassroots anti-Brexit groups have joined forces in the new campaign which is demanding a public final say on the eventual Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May reached with Brussels.The campaign brings together Open Britain along with the European Movement and another seven organisations that collectively claim to have more than 700,000 supporters, 20,000 activists, and more than a million followers on social media.James McGrory, executive director of Open Britain, which is supporting the People's Vote campaign, said: \"Whether you think the government will negotiate a good deal or bad deal, Brexit is definitely a big deal.\"\"Brexit is not inevitable.

If the public demand a People's Vote, politicians will fall in line.\"Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said:\"It may seem like the odds are stacked against us as a movement, but fighting for what you believe in is never easy. We are short on time, but we have people power on our side. Together, are on the verge of something extraordinary.\"Actor Stewart said in a media interview Sunday that if people voted to reject the exit deal, Britain would simply stay in the EU.He said the group does not oppose the result of the 2016 EU referendum or call for a second referendum.Stewart added: \"As time has gone by, the information that we are receiving about the terms and conditions of that separation are quite unlike the terms and conditions that were spoken of so loosely during the 2016 campaign.\"Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, responding to the new campaign, said the people's vote had already taken place, adding: \"They voted with a substantial majority to leave the EU. We're now trying to deliver on that mandate from the people.\"\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          China helping clear Brexit storm clouds\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "Sino-British ties strengthening ahead of UK's European departureOn Thursday, June 23, 2016, the day of the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, parts of London were hit by a huge storm.Thunder, torrential rain, and lightning strikes saw the London Fire Brigade receive an entire day's worth of calls in 90 minutes. Roads were flooded and there was transport chaos. But the next day, people woke up to something even more shocking.Out of the 72 percent of eligible voters who turned out to take part in the referendum nationwide, a slim majority - 51.9 percent - had voted to leave the trading bloc. London, by contrast, had voted 60 percent in favor of remaining in the EU. The process known as Brexit had begun.Fast forward two years and the outlook remains unsettled. Then-prime minister David Cameron, the man who called the referendum, resigned as soon as its result became clear. His successor, Theresa May, who as home secretary had made a speech in April 2016 in which she said \"remaining inside the European Union does make us more secure, it does make us more prosperous, and it does make us more influential beyond our shores\", had inherited the task of overseeing Britain's departure from the EU, which is scheduled for the end of March 2019. This is proving to be a spectacularly complex process.The pronouncement of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox that Britain's post-Brexit free-trade deal with the EU would be the \"easiest in human history\" has proved to be anything but, and given the uncertainty over what divorce terms Britain will manage to secure, many international companies seem to be erring on the side of caution and drawing up plans to relocate from the UK to mainland Europe.Frankfurt, home of Germany's financial sector, seems to be benefiting, and in April The Independent newspaper quoted Tarek al-Wazir, the economy minister for the state of Hesse, where the city is situated, as saying \"we've got 18 entities that have committed\". He was confident more would follow.Morgan Stanley has confirmed it is moving up to 10 percent of its United Kingdom workforce, and Goldman Sachs has also shown signs of having itchy feet, gradually increasing its presence in mainland Europe.Given the uncertainty that surrounds Britain's future relationship with its nearest neighbors, and the unpredictable behavior of its previous best friend, the United States, the country is casting its eyes around for new trading partners and friends for the coming years. And few nations look quite as attractive as China.Fortunately for Britain, the cultivation of this relationship is not beginning from a standing start. Long before Brexit was a reality, President Xi Jinping had already made a high-profile trip to the UK and met Cameron, ushering in what is known as the \"golden era\" of Sino-British relations. And, early this year, May visited China to strengthen those ties.On the face of it, Britain would seem to be in a strong position. Xinhua News Agency this year reported that Britain is China's second-largest trading partner within the EU, and that China is the UK's second-largest non-EU trading partner.Trade between the two countries rose in 2017 to $79 billion, an increase of almost 6.2 percent on the previous year. And British exports to China went up 19.4 percent.Tony Samuels, a lawyer and notary public with Howard Kennedy LLP in the City of London financial district, has worked closely with many of China's leading financial institutions.He said that, despite the challenges posed by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, London has always held a special allure for Chinese individuals and companies, and he expects this relationship to flourish in the years to come.\"London has always been very attractive,\" he said. \"Pre-Brexit they were buying up lots of residential and residential block developments. For example, the area around the American embassy in Vauxhall was being consumed by the Chinese very quickly. They're still buying now, but not in such big numbers.\"That's because the Chinese are being wary. They don't plan five or 10 years ahead like some countries. With China, it's 20 or 30 years. It's all about capital appreciation - they're in it for the long term, so they'll come to London to buy serious sites for serious money and stay for the long term.\"Bigger pictureIn a turbulent world, the ability to look at the bigger picture, and stability, are key elements to ensuring security - and Samuels says these are factors that make Brexit an opportunity for Sino-British ties to become stronger than ever.\"With or without Brexit, Shanghai deals more with London than anywhere else in the world, so pre-or post-Brexit, China is crucial to our trade going forward,\" Samuels said.\" The EU and USA are our main trading partners at the moment, but my guess is that in 15 or so years, China might overtake them both.\"If a country's mood can be interpreted in any way by its movements, then the prospects for London's long history of good relations with China are encouraging.Earlier this month, city development 5 Broadgate was bought by Hong Kong's CK Asset Holdings for 1 billion pounds, meaning it joins such iconic London landmarks as 20 Fenchurch Street (the skyscraper also known as the Walkie Talkie) and 122 Leadenhall Street (another skyscraper, aka the Cheesegrater) in being Chinese-owned.Perhaps even more symbolic than these purchases, was the Chinese government's May announcement that its new London embassy will be on the site of the former Royal Mint, close to the financial heart of the city and the Tower of London, one of the capital's most famous landmarks. The past, it would appear, has a role in shaping the future - even if just now no one is entirely sure what that future looks like.Mark Tucker, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, said: \"Establishing a long-term strategic plan for trade and investment relationships with China is vital, in our view, to clarify and secure the UK's place in this world.\"The UK's relationship with China requires a long-term approach. This long-term strategic approach will require a different mindset. The Belt and Road Initiative lays the foundation for sustainable growth for decades to come,\" said Tucker.So, while the storm clouds that accompanied the arrival of Brexit may not yet have fully cleared, Samuels says all the signals he is receiving are that its outcome will be an opportunity for both countries, and the long-term forecast is for much improved conditions.Cecily Liu contributed to this article.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          May faces down pro-EU rebel lawmakers to win Brexit vote\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "LONDON - Prime Minister Theresa May won a crucial Brexit vote in parliament on Wednesday, keeping her divided government's plans to end more than 40 years of British partnership with the European Union on track.After pro-EU Conservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve said he would support the government's proposal for a \"meaningful vote\" in parliament on Britain's exit, a potential rebellion that could have undermined May's authority was averted.May adopted a high-risk strategy by facing off with rebels in her Conservative Party, and it paid off. The upper house of parliament later approved the bill, paving the way for it to become law after gaining formal \"Royal Assent\" from the Queen.May said in a statement that the bill's passage was a crucial step in delivering Brexit, and more details of proposed future links with the EU would be published in the coming weeks.But the battle over the EU withdrawal bill, her Brexit blueprint, may be a taste of things to come. May needs to get several other bills through parliament to prepare Britain for life outside the EU, a momentous change to its trading and political relationships after decades in the bloc.Some of her opponents on Brexit may simply have decided to keep their powder dry for later fights on issues such as future trading ties and customs arrangements with the bloc before Britain's scheduled departure in March next year.Six Conservatives still voted against the government. But for now, May will be relieved to have overcome another potential crisis over her proposal for the role of parliament, should she fail to negotiate an exit agreement with the EU or if lawmakers reject any deal she returns with from Brussels.Talks with the bloc have all but stalled, with May's top team of ministers at odds over plans for future trading relations with the EU, which businesses complain makes them unable to plan their investment decisions.Reuters\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "\n          Will Brexit park the UK's electric vehicle industry?\n        ", "classes": [], "content": "Pending exit from the European Union puts the future of Britain\u2019s low-carbon vehicle production in doubt as China\u2019s automakers race forwardSlowly and quietly, the electric vehicle revolution is creeping up on us. Last year, a record 1 million electric cars were sold, taking the global stock to 3 million, according to the International Energy Agency.In Britain, the number of registered plug-in vehicles has risen from 3,500 in 2013 to more than 160,000 this year. Electric black cabs made by the China-owned London Electric Vehicle Company have been deployed on the streets of the capital, and will soon be joined by electric double-decker buses made by Chinese-automobile manufacturer BYD.In China, more than 30 million electric two-wheelers and 100,000 electric buses were sold in 2017, where 1.2 million electric passenger-cars already hum along the roads.While China is leading the world in electric vehicle take-up, the United Kingdom is competing with its neighbors to head up electric vehicle production in Europe.Germany, Britain, and France are the three largest carmakers in Europe, and all face radical changes in their industrial infrastructure as an increasing number of nations commit to phasing out internal combustion engines.But a pending exit from the European Union, and the recent channeling of billions of dollars of electric vehicle investment from large automakers toward China, has cast doubt on Britain\u2019s prospects to lead the charge in Europe.\u201cBrexit creates difficulty for the UK to lead in e-mobility,\u201d said Julia Poliscanova, manager of clean vehicles at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, which is also called the EFT&E. \u201cThe UK would like to position itself as the hub for electric vehicle production in the future. But, if they are outside of the bigger European market, and if there are tariffs, it will be very difficult to attract companies to develop products.\u201dLast year, 1.67 million cars were manufactured in the UK, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and only 20,000 of those were electric. The UK highlighted plans to increase production in its industrial strategy published in November.But last week, the British government received a stark warning from the country\u2019s largest car manufacturer. Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company would face profit losses of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year should the government fail to negotiate \u201ctariff-free access and frictionless trade\u201d with the EU.Speth said a \u201cbad Brexit deal\u201d could force the carmaker out of Britain and put 40,000 jobs at risk.His comments also suggested that Jaguar Land Rover could pull the handbrake on plans to relocate manufacturing of the company\u2019s electric vehicle, the Jaguar I-Pace, from Austria to the UK \u2014 a move that was supposed to bring 10,000 jobs to Britain.\u201cElectrification and connectivity offer significant economic and productivity opportunities \u2014 get Brexit wrong and British people, businesses, and broader society lose the chance to lead in smart mobility,\u201d Speth said.Prior to the Brexit vote, the UK looked well-placed to compete in electric vehicle production.Big car-producing nations in Europe were put on notice in 2010 when Nissan, one of the world\u2019s largest car makers, announced it would produce the all-electric Nissan Leaf in the UK. It was a huge coup, positioning the UK right where it wanted to be \u2014 Nissan would make the world\u2019s best-selling electric car in Tennessee for the North American market, in Japan for Asia, and in the UK for Europe.\u201cWe can achieve our aim of making the UK a world-leader in ultra-low carbon vehicles,\u201d said Peter Mandelson, who was Britain\u2019s business secretary at the time.British automaker Aston Martin followed suit last year, announcing plans to produce an electric vehicle in the UK beginning in 2019.Last summer, BMW announced it would assemble its new electric Mini next year at its Cowley site, near Oxford in the UK, with motors built in Germany. The German automaker said it did not ask for any Brexit-related assurances from the British government when making its decision.\nEnglish|\u4e2d\u6587\n"}{"head": "What Putin Really Thinks About Brexit", "classes": ["more"], "content": "Russia steadfastly refused to tell the British people what to do - unlike the United States and the European UnionNot that anyone West of then Kiev\u00a0will believe him, but Russian president Vladimir Putin told a gathering of business leaders and politicians at a Tashkent summit by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) that no way no how is Russia influencing anti-E.U. referendums.\u201cRussia does not interfere now or in the future, nor is \u00a0going to influence the choices of the U.K.,\u201d \u00a0he said at the central Asian summit. Putin leaves the former Soviet city and heads to China on Monday, four days after pro-sanction U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Anti-Russia conspiracy theorists have pointed to a number of media operations within the E.U. that promote European skepticism. Other critics argue that Russia\u2019s government officially supports politicians or non-profits that indirectly support leaders who are friendly to Russian causes. It is unclear why Russia would be interested in breaking up the European Union, as that does not necessarily pose any threat to the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO is the seen as the biggest existential threat to Russia, though this too is debatable.Putin laid to rest this weekend that Russians are celebrating the Brexit vote. Some 52% of Great Britain citizens voted to leave the European Union, with a high 72% voter turnout.Putin told guests at the SCO summit that the referendum outcome \u201cshowed how the British are unhappy with the level of security in the country\u2026and against subsidizing other economies. I think it is understandable why this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one likes to feed and subsidize weaker countries and be a care taker all the time,\u201d Interfax quoted him saying on Friday. \u201cThey clearly want to be more independent from Brussels,\u201d he said.Putin said that media reports about U.K politicians saying how he would be happy about a Brexit were \u201cimproper attempt to influence public opinion.\u201d\u201cAs we can see, that had no impact on the results,\u201d he said, further criticizing the British press and some politicians. \u201cWe do not expect this to result in a global catastrophe,\u201d Putin added.U.K. voters rejected the European Union, not to be in cahoots with Russia, but because they were against being ruled \u2014 on some matters \u2014 by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. Steve Forbes pointed this out in an\u00a0op-ed here\u00a0on Friday. When the economic crisis hit Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, the response of Germany and Brussels was to demand austerity, \u201cbut it was of the pro-big-government, anti-private-sector variety,\u201d he writes. Taxes went up and some public services were cut, but the government sector was spared. Ireland refused to listen to Brussels and kept its corporate tax rate of 12.5%, recovering far faster than the others and actually voting to remain in the European Union.The second, if not biggest blunder, was immigration policies regarding Syrian refugees. Angela Merkel\u2019s decision \u201cto let hundreds of thousands of Mideast refugees into a continent that has badly handled the integration of past immigrants\u2013notoriously letting virtual self-governing areas arise that became a haven for terrorists\u2013was the breaking point,\u201d Forbes writes.These two egregious errors have already led to the rise of nationalist politics. Merkel\u2019s own coalition is splintering. The most popular political figure there is a member of the leftist Green Party. The second-most popular is the foreign minister, who says Germany must come closer to working with Russia.Russia investors, of course, love this idea. They would like to see sanctions removed.But even the idea that Brexit makes it easier for Europe to scramble for friends, even \u201cfrenemies\u201d, Russia\u2019s food industry, which has banned imports from Europe in retaliation for sanctions, has invested billions in upgrading production and creating new produce markets for home-grown goods. Russia faces a double edged sword in the removal of sanctions as it is. But seeing how the E.U. voted to extend sanctions out til January 2017, both sides have at least six months to figure out what the E.U. without the U.K. looks like politically.

This theory goes something like this: the people keep voting against us, time and again, therefore they must have been duped by propaganda emanating from the Kremlin, where lies today\u2019s bogeyman.If you were to believe the mainstream media outlets in the United Kingdom, such as state-owned propaganda machine the BBC, or Murdoch-owned Sky News, then Russia is the new Hitler, the reason your children don\u2019t have a future, the reason your currency is hemorrhaging value and so on and so forth.Of course, when the ruling elites of the UK surprisingly lost the referendum to decide the country\u2019s membership of the European Union, they fell back on this most lazy of excuses. It has to be said that Russia has not been the only target of their frustrated autopsy; they first blamed the peoples\u2019 stupidity, and the alleged misinformation spread by British \u2018leave\u2019 campaigners.But since these excuses have been found wanting, they\u2019ve turned their attention back to this Russia conspiracy, which becomes all the more devious as they piggyback the mass hysteria across the pond in the United States regarding Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the US Presidential Election \u2013 which has since been disproven as the pernicious conspiracy theory that it unquestionably is.Now, more and more, Europhile MPs on both sides of the political divide, in an overwhelmingly Europhile Westminster bubble, are fanning the flames of suspicion and conspiracy by alleging that Russia and, particularly, the Kremlin, interfered in Britain\u2019s democratic process.Indeed, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee summoned representatives of multimedia companies Google and Facebook, demanding that they report back on any \u2018Russian meddling\u2019 in the referendum campaign. Chair of this Select Committee is Conservative Party \u2013 and \u2018remain\u2019 supporting MP Damian Collins \u2013 who apparently seems to think we\u2019re living in East Berlin, circa 1984.Earlier this month, the same Select Committee ventured out from their mansions to hear 5 hours of testimony in Washington D.C, which included an hour each from representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter.But despite their exhaustive efforts to legitimise their crazed ramblings about Kremlin conspiracies, they have turned up precisely zero evidence that the Russian state even paid any attention to the vote, let alone masterminded a high-tech psychological operation to somehow sway the outcome. A Facebook investigation on behalf of the British Electoral Commission found that \u2018a handful\u2019 of accounts \u2018possibly linked to Russia\u2019 spent a grand total of \u00a30.70 on Brexit-related adverts, which subsequently appeared in all of 200 peoples\u2019 News Feeds. Bear in mind that the vote was won by a margin of over a million votes. The enquiry in Washington brought further disappointment to those intent on deflecting the blame for losing the referendum, as the testimony of Twitter, Facebook and Google representatives concluded that there was \u2018no evidence\u2019 of Russian interference in the EU referendum.The extent of the establishment\u2019s substantiation of their assertion that Russia interfered with the EU referendum comes in the form of a highly partisan report compiled by the US Democratic Party \u2013 who themselves are reeling from losing the election to Donald Trump - which claimed that \u2018questions had been raised about the source of wealth\u2019 of some \u2018leave\u2019 donors \u2013 of course, the Guardian article reporting this \u201cnews\u201d remained coy as to by whom these questions were raised.The same report claims that prominent Brexit supporter Nigel Farage \u2018criticised sanctions against Russia\u2019 and \u2018provided flattering assessments of Russian President Putin\u2019. To address the first point, it\u2019s important to remember that the British Electoral Commission demands, by law, that all funding of election and referendum campaigns is totally transparent, and there is no inkling of a suggestion that the \u2018leave\u2019 campaigners fell foul of this high standard. There is, however, plenty of evidence that the \u2018remain\u2019 campaigners were in flagrant violation of a number of spending laws, which of course have been overlooked to suit a political agenda.The second point, regarding what Mr Farage may or may not have said about Russia, is laughable to the point that it isn\u2019t worth refuting. However, in the interest of thoroughness, I will briefly address it. Of course Nigel Farage, an economic libertarian and self-professed Thatcherite, criticised sanctions against Russia, in the same way that the Iron Lady herself refused to endorse sanctions against the Apartheid regime in South Africa, or the white government of Rhodesia in the 1980s. This is a point of purely ideological persuasion and offers no insight into what the people behind the statements think about the subjects of their musings. And it must also be noted that Mr Farage did not say anything flattering about Russia. In fact, he clearly stated that \u2018Putin\u2019s Russia is not a place I\u2019d like to live\u2019, and has maintained such criticisms throughout his political career. At the end of the day, one must remember that Nigel Farage, for all his great attributes, is fundamentally a liberal who seeks to uphold the perverse values of modernity, thus he has little ideological commonality with Putin\u2019s Russia.Throughout all of this lies a theme, a recurring theme, of deflection. The root of the liberal Europhile\u2019s obsession with the Russian bogeyman can be found in their insecurities about their own inadequacies. They simply cannot bring themselves to admit that maybe, just maybe, the wisdom of the masses is slowly coming to reject their liberal, globalist ideology. To them, the alternative to passive acceptance of the present Zeitgeist is too terrifying to acknowledge, therefore they adopt this rather pathological and conspiratorial mindset as a new means of legitimising their power.But behind this understandable if not condonable pathology, there lies a deeper, more pernicious deflection. I am, of course, referring to their own special interest parties, their own sly backhanders, their own attempts to pervert democracy as popular will. Fortunately for them, the media moguls have decided that only their opponents may be suspected of foul play, whilst any such suggestions leveled against the establishment\u2019s side are utterly preposterous. Yet, oftentimes, one finds them to be the guiltiest of all!For instance, it has recently been revealed that Jewish-American billionaire George Soros has donated \u00a3400,000\u00a0to a campaign called \u2018Best for Britain\u2019, launched on 26th April 2017 with the expressed purpose of stopping Brexit. His sizeable donation was only revealed earlier this month, at the same time it was revealed that Russian agitators may have spent a grand total of \u00a30.70 on Brexit-related advertising. Yet all the focus remains on the Russian bogeyman!Not a soul dares raise the issue of Jewish interference, or American interference, in the same way. Similarly, nobody cried foreign interference when Guiana-born multi-millionaire Investment Manager Gina Miller (born Gina Singh) took the UK government through the courts in an attempt to stop the Brexit process. Interestingly, Gina Miller is known to have pumped large sums of money into her efforts to prevent the peoples\u2019 will from being realised, and is known to be the founder of the Soros-friendly Best for Britain \u2013 yet still, nobody dares speak of foreign interference.As an aside, but a point of interest, nobody ever seems interested in the British government\u2019s role in or funding for the so-called Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine that took place in 2014, despite the evidence that the United States and the European Union have pumped billions into this anti-Russia campaign. Then-Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond openly defended the UK government\u2019s role in \u2018supplying non-lethal aid\u2019 to the EU puppet regime in Kiev. However, in the eyes of the media elites, Russian trolls spending \u00a30.70 on adverts for an election campaign is more a matter of public interest than the British government actively supporting a violent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in a foreign country, with the expressed desire to turn said country\u2019s government away from friendship with Russia. \u00a0It seems obvious to me and, I\u2019m sure, anybody else observing this sequence of events that the whole \u201cRussia did it\u201d allegation is a fa\u00e7ade. It\u2019s merely a game of smoke and mirrors played by the ruling elites, which is, 1.) to direct attention away from their own failings and, 2.) a\u00a0projection of their own complicity in undermining democracy.However, the ramifications of such pathological disinformation campaigns are of a much greater significance than the eternally myopic apparatchiks of the regnant liberal parties can possibly comprehend. For it is not simply a matter of harmlessly deflecting blame from one\u2019s own shortcomings, but in fact it\u2019s a matter jeopardising a very serious international relationship with one of the world\u2019s foremost superpowers.What do the Russians think when they see their country wrongly accused of espionage and subversion? Of course, one would expect the Russian government to be fairly hostile to that of the United Kingdom, given the latter\u2019s support for unwarranted sanctions against her country, yet up until this point the Russian government have continued to extend an olive branch in good faith.Allegations of subversion and espionage are very serious accusations indeed. Despite it being of the greatest geopolitical wisdom for the United Kingdom to ally herself with a strong Russia \u2013 not to mention a useful means of throwing off the American yoke \u2013 her leaders seem unconcerned by the prospect of irreparably damaging relations between the two old nations, if they\u2019ve even taken the time to consider such a consequence at all.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Let\u2019s just take three socio-cultural phenomena as examples.The first is Saudi Arabia. This country is widely recognized as the guardian of Islam\u2019s holiest places and the protector of said religion. \u00a0It is also the number one supporter of a terrorist group actively engaged in killing thousands of Muslims in the name of Allah.By any measure this is clearly illogical.Secondly, if one studies Cultural Anthropology one learns about a social phenomenon called \u201cHypodescent\u201d. This term refers to an American practice common in the old racist South whereby a child born of an interracial relationship between a white person and black person automatically would be labelled and identified as simply \u201cblack\u201d rather than of mixed race. The reasoning was that any combination of \u201cwhite\u201d blood and \u201cblack\u201d blood resulted in the contamination of pure \u201cwhite blood\u201d thusly degrading the bloodline and producing an inferior member of the species. And yet in America we refer to Barack Obama \u2013 the child of a mixed marriage between a white mother and black father \u2013 as the first \u201cblack president\u201d. \u00a0Though this is clearly racist, no one dares point it out.This is simply illogical.Thirdly\u2026In Great Britain recently the majority of people voted in a referendum to leave the European Union - the so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d. \u00a0Viewing this example of direct democracy in action the EU naturally recognized the results of the vote as reflecting \u00a0\u201cthe will of the people\u201d. Similarly, two years ago in Crimea a majority of people voted in a referendum to exit from Ukraine \u2013 a \u201cCrimexit\u201d if you will. However, the same EU did not recognize this particular referendum as reflecting \u201cthe will of the people\u201d even though the vote was not even close.Currently, there are guardians of democracy in the UK and Europe who are calling for a second referendum to determine if the majority of people \u201creally, really, actually want to do this Brexit thing\u201d. According to their logic, a second referendum is needed to fully confirm that the true \u201cwill of the people\u201d is clearly known \u2013 a \u201csecond opinion\u201d as some are calling it.If one examines closely the parallels here, one sees that in actuality, that the Crimeans themselves have already voted twice for their \u201cCrimexit\u201d \u2013 the first being held in 1991. (At the time the government of Ukraine simply ignored the results of the vote).The problem is that the guardians of democracy in the UK and Europe do not recognize the results of two referenda in Crimea thereby contradicting their own logic and reasoning with regard to \u201ctrue democracy\u201d being dependent on two votes.So illogical\u2026Is it any wonder that intelligent beings in the Cosmos are so far away from us?This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Despite this, Johnson appears more than willing to accept the anti-Russia story as \u201cclear.\u201dThe question is how Vladimir Putin managed to hack the earlier pro-Brexit Boris Johnson's mouth.

Nevertheless, it is precisely America which is disengaging from Europe, except for the region on the border with the Russian Federation, where the US Armed Forces (and not only the NATO ones) are converging, with an ad hoc military structure and a new network of sensors and missile sites, both fixed and mobile ones, between Poland and Romania up to the Turkish border.As is the case with its scarcely imaginatively currency, the European Union proposes itself as a \"bridge\" for resolving tensions between the Middle East, North Africa and the Persian Gulf, but with no weapons and no credible economic leverage, without stable allies and with a policy still oriented to the old peacekeeping concept.Hence if Brexit succeeds, Prime Minister David Cameron - heir to Premier Margaret Thatcher who, at first, made Great Britain adhere to the EU in 1973 and later coldly managed the British presence within the organization - will have no interest in implementing or even discussing the new EU global strategy.If Brexit fails, however, it would be mostly the same.Prime Minister Cameron will either come even closer to US interests, or he will play with his own forces among the various regional powers in the above mentioned areas.Even if Bremain were successful, the British authorities would have no interest in pressing ahead with the new European Global Strategy.The fact is that there is an old system which is changing and shrinking, namely the Euro-Atlantic system, and a new system being built, namely Eurasia led by Russia and China, which will reach up to the Mediterranean with its Belt and Road Initiative and the integration of its economies into the vast Asian world, which is recording an economic and strategic expansion fully promoted by China.The EU has not chosen yet and it has not dealt these issues with the respective poles of attraction. It still has a vision that Marx would call \"economicist\" and believes that a powerless GDP, deprived of strategic perspectives, is enough to stay afloat in the future multipolar world.In the event of a soft Brexit, Great Britain may collaborate with the European Union's core countries to a common security policy, but it is extremely unlikely for the EU to implement its global foreign policy without the support of a military, diplomatic and intelligence power such as Great Britain.The possibility of counter-terrorism cooperation with the rest of Europe at collective security level would remain open, but certainly the project of a Joint European Army - as called for by many circles - would fade away.Many weaknesses do not create a force, and it is not clear what the \"external objectives\" and the unified strategy of the new Joint European Army could be.Without any reference to Brexit, Great Britain has planned to invest 178 billion pounds over a ten-year period, as stated in the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2015.Great Britain wants to become a \"pocket superpower\" on its own, as quickly as possible.Rather than at a Common European Security and Defense Policy, it has never liked, Great Britain is still aiming at the wide NATO context and at enhanced bilateral cooperation with the EU Member States within it.France is certainly a candidate for stable collaboration with Great Britain, but France officially theorizes the participation of the German Armed Forces and this is not wished at all by Great Britain.Great Britain seems to be still living at the time of Lord Kitchener\u2019s policy: it wants a united Europe as a way to be spared East and South (trade, migration and financial) invasions, but it does not think of a strongly united EU, which would inevitably become German-led.But what is the current EU influence on the NATO framework? It is far from negligible.Since 2003 there has been a significant contribution of European countries\u2019 troops to the Atlantic Alliance\u2019s mechanism of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), a brigade designed to move very quickly towards NATO's Eastern borders.It is subject to the rule of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.Europe is present in the VJTF primarily for its economic commitments in Ukraine, following the signing of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the country.The DCFTA between the EU and Ukraine envisages, first of all, the removal of all import and export taxes.Also at agricultural level there are duty free products: cereals, pork and beef, poultry and horticulture.Also the trade of manufactured goods has been liberalized, especially for the companies operating in the textiles and machine tools sectors.Obviously the core of the issue is that a sharp reduction of duties is envisaged also for the petroleum products.Hence, while the EU overall strategy is moving along the lines of defining various individual strategies for each point of crisis (Sahel, Libya, the Horn of Africa, etc.), Great Britain may certainly participate in the NATO framework of these operations, but it has no interest in taking part in it as a EU member.Great Britain will never be - nor could it be otherwise - a sort of Australia or New Zealand at military and strategic levels.It will never be a power \"on call\", as some domestic workers.Britain has the potential, ideas and weapons to become - by itself - the power broker in all the regions in which it is directly interested: the North Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Greater Middle East.Since its membership of the EU in 1973, Great Britain has always considered its diplomatic policy in the European Union as a subset of its broader foreign policy action.Since the time of Prime Minister Churchill onwards, Europe has been one of the components of the British presence in the world.It has been its \"second circle\", but never the first, which is the special relationship with its old rebellious colonies, namely the United States.This is even the sense in which we have to interpret Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s remark \"We butchered the wrong pig\", when \u2013 in the aftermath of World War II - he developed the very secret plan Operation Unthinkable, which assumed the British invasion of the USSR to destroy Bolshevism in the phase of its greatest weakness.The UK overall strategy vis-\u00e0-vis the EU has always been the stabilization of the Union as a largely deregulated free trade area, as well as its rapid expansion and the often clear and sharp refusal of any attempt to turn the European Union into a political entity, or even worse, into the \"United States of Europe\".Obviously Great Britain has always tended to equate its solitary role in Europe with the Franco-German duo as EU leaders and it has always tried to outline the EU strategic lines together or, sometimes, against the French-German axis.Hence Great Britain has always been particularly interested in the Common European Foreign and Security Policy, in the Common Security and Defense Policy and in all EU external relations, often established by its individual Member States through the EU channels.Hence the British primary interest for the EU External Action Service.And it is only on the basis of the 32 different documents drafted by the British government during the 2010-2015 Review of the Balance of Competences that we can analyze the costs and benefits of Brexit or Bremain.In terms of foreign policy, there is a British strong interest in operating through the European channels \u2013 for its own purposes.Furthermore Great Britain has been reluctant even to accept the rules of the European Fiscal Stability Treaty of December 2011.Since then the British media and governments have been supporting both the EU and the Commonwealth as the pillars of a new British foreign and security policy not confined only to the pro-European framework.Even the visits that Prime Minister Cameron paid abroad at the beginning of his first term were designed to convey two messages: Great Britain does not live only within the European Union, which is not the only focus and horizon of its foreign policy; Great Britain is more suitable than other geopolitical areas for keeping pace with the times - namely the Asian expansion, the new poles of development in Latin America and the significant growth of the Russian Federation.Hence a new National Security Council has been established, which regularly drafts the National Security Strategy (NSS).Every five years, also the Strategic Defense and Security Strategy (SDSS) is drawn up.The 2010 NSS and SDSS recommended a \"decentralized approach\" to the EU, as was also the case with the 2015 Strategies.In both documents the position maintained is that of a minor EU role in supporting the British choices.In any case the role played by Great Britain within the EU will remain stable both in case of Brexit and in case of Bremain and also the international challenges that Great Britain has decided to face in the coming years will remain the same.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

What all the pronouncements of this sort have in common is the claim to know better than the Russian Government where our national interest lies and what our policies are.\u00a0In a sense Russia is scapegoated for almost everything that has gone wrong in Britain and the West over the past 25 years, i.e. the War in Iraq, misadventure in Libya, global financial crisis, advent of deglobalisation (the term, coined by Gordon Brown), the Ukrainian and Syrian crises, and now the rise of anti-establishment sentiment in the West and the migration crisis of the EU.That behaviour has reached a new high now that Russia is being dragged into the domestic debate on Brexit. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, speaking at the Chatham House on 2 March said, that \u201cthe only country who would like us to leave the EU is Russia.\u201d And that, according to him, \u201cshould tell us all we need to know.\u201d\u00a0First of all, why is the wicked Russia thesis used to explain a Government policy, be it the presumed deal struck with the EU partners or a more fundamental issue of the EU membership, which must be defended on its merits? Secondly, why is it all the British public need to know?And why shift the topic? The EU is not a military alliance, which is Nato. It is not about the special relationship with the US. Neither is the British nuclear deterrent involved, not is, for that matter, London\u2019s permanent seat at the UN Security Council at stake.It goes without saying that we have a huge problem with this strategy/tactics. It seems that the present British Government has a vested interest in a disfunctional bilateral relationship with Russia.\u00a0Another conclusion one may draw therefrom is that the authorities thus admit that they cannot win the argument in an open and straightforward debate. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t oblige.\u00a0We find this unfair towards both Russia, with whom Britain maintains diplomatic relations, and the British people, who deserve a better treatment from their own government.We expect our British partners to explain themselves. In the meantime, we\u2019d like the British people to know that those pronouncements have nothing to do with Russia\u2019s policy.\u00a0As a matter of fact, our Government doesn\u2019t have an opinion on Britain\u2019s place in the EU. We have nothing to do with the very idea to hold this referendum. It is for the British to decide. We\u2019ll accept any outcome. We have enough problems of our own to mind somebody else\u2019s business. More than that, we believe that if our Western partners had minded their own business well enough, all of us would have had fewer international problems on our hands.It doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have problems dealing with the EU. Overall, we share the concern over the bias in the form of political expediency/correctness that stifles debate on real issue, forces real life into the straitjacket of ideological constructs and schemes. In reality, these leads to crises like the EU unilateralist foray, under the previous Brussels team, into the Ukrainian affairs.We are even blamed for the migration crisis in Europe. And that contrary to the fact that it started well before our limited military intervention in Syria on 30 September 2015, which radically changed the dynamics in that country, helped establish the IGSS and bring hope of peace.\u00a0Was it not the West, who by way of Libyan intervention as a precedent misled the Syrians on both sides and then outsourced the regime change to its regional allies, who have their own accounts to settle, have designs on Syrian territory and still insist that Syria become a Sunni state?\u00a0Russia, on the contrary, is hugely contributing to finding a political solution in Syria and, thus, alleviating the migration crisis. This is done at least at four levels: fighting Isis (our limited Air Force deployment), working in tandem with the US in the IGSS, mediating support for the ceasefire at the grass-root level on the ground and providing humanitarian aid.\u00a0We\u2019d like to know what the British record on Syria is?We wouldn\u2019t have dwelt on that, had HMG not alluded to the Russian threat to British national security at every opportunity.

Unilever on 15 March 2018 said they have decided to move its corporate headquarters from Britain to Netherlands. EPA-EFE/HANNAH MCKAYTheresa May is proposing a hard Brexit for services and a soft Brexit for goods.The White Paper commitmentThe British government published on Thursday a so-called \u201cWhite Paper,\u201d that is, a consolidated negotiating position on how London envisions its relationship with the 500-strong Single Market after it leaves the EU.Critics have long said that London has been negotiating with itself, as Theresa May has been struggling to form a single position on Brexit that brings onboard hardline leave campaigners and those seeking to maintain the status quo in economic ties the UK harnessed over the last 45 years of EU membership.The vision put forward last Friday is now formalized. Seen and treated as a mere formality, the new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab presented the paper in parliament without distributing a copy of the policy to MPs in advance.It\u2019s there in black and whiteFor those that did read the paper \u2013 in advance or after its formal release \u2013 it presented few surprises. \u00a0The main idea is a soft Brexit in goods and a hard Brexit in services.The UK government proposes a common regulatory framework and a customs\u2019 \u201ccombined area,\u201d although a big conceptual gap remains as to how VAT tax collection will be organized.The proposal also envisages the UK maintaining some sort of Associate membership in key regulatory agencies that set standards in the chemicals, aviation and medicines. The issue is whether this will be possible without a common normative foundation.In this scheme, Theresa May hopes for a practical and business-friendly Brexit that will not trigger the loss of blue-collar jobs. Over the last two weeks industrial behemoths such as Airbus, Nissan, Land Rover, BMW, Siemens had been warning that the breaking up of pan-European value chains was pushing them out of the UK.Equally significant is that this plan seems to receiving a nod in Dublin, which means the UK is closer to retaining open borders \u2013 and peace \u2013 in Northern Ireland.On services, the main scenario is a hard Brexit based on the concept of \u201cequivalence,\u201d which provides unreliable access to the Single Market based on mutual recognition of standards that can be revoked. For over a year, major lenders, consulting groups and insurers have been setting up officers in a series of cities across Europe to retain so-called \u201cpassporting rights.\u201dAs regard to the \u201cfreedom of movement,\u201d the UK aspires to freedom of movement for tourists, controlling migration for business purposes.The red line on the European Court of Justice jurisdiction has been somewhat blurred, as UK tribunals will consult EU case law. However, London insists on international arbitration rather than ECJ jurisdiction.Half-Empty versus Half-full reactionsNo stakeholder is entirely satisfied with the White Paper: some MPs and the service sector express dismay; hardline Brexiteers express outrage; EU leaders reserve the right to express their opinion after they have properly considered the proposal. Meanwhile, Theresa May is back on thin ice.Following the resignation of the Brexit chief negotiator David Davis and the foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Monday, hardline backbenchers are now taking the lead in calling into question the legitimacy of May\u2019s compromise.The influential Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Thursday that the paper sets out a \u201cbad deal for Britain.\u201d Taking a step further, Rees-Mogg will try to amend government legislation next week, so as to ensure that Northern Ireland cannot have a separate trade regime than the rest of the UK.The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the plan means the UK will \u201chalf leave\u201d the EU.May reiterated that the plan delivers on the promise to \u201ctake back control of our money, our laws and our borders.\u201dOpposition MPs called for a closer union with the EU, with Labour drawing close to a Norway type deal, while some campaign for a second referendum.Brussels appears to be responding positively. Both Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt welcomed the UK\u2019s proposal. However, neither of them commented on policy detail.In any event, the White Paper has been reportedly been drafted with the consultation of EU leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel. Chancellor Merkel has made no comment on the subject.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "Brexit talks restart without key ministers in Brussels", "classes": ["p1", "p1", "p1", "p1", "p1"], "content": "New British Government Brexit secretary Dominic Raab arrives for a cabinet meeting in Downing Street, central London, Britain, 10 July 2018.Dominic Raab, the UK\u2019s\u00a0new Brexit Secretary is not attending the latest\u00a0round of Brexit negotiations as this week\u2019s early discussions will be left to civil servants until July 19 even if both sides insist that the talks will intensify\u00a0ahead\u00a0of October\u2019s deal deadline.Britain\u2019s new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also not attending the EU-28 Foreign Affairs Council, but instead sent the UK\u2019s Permanent Representative\u00a0 Tim Barrow, to fill in for him at what was to be his first ministerial engagement with his counterparts from the European Union.Barnier and Raab are expected to join the discussions by Thursday.Brexit talks are restarting after Theresa May\u2019s moves to fill the gaps left by the sudden resignations of\u00a0David Davis, Boris Johnson after May\u2019s White Paper on Brexit,\u00a0known as the Chequers Agreement, deeply divided Britain\u2019s Tories.

To glimpse a current example, look no further than the United Kingdom. As the Brexit negotiations with the European Union approach a tipping point \u2013 this month\u2019s European Council meeting \u2013 the British government is seeking its scorned European partners\u2019 help in its dispute with Russia over the attempted murder of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England.But even before the brazen attack on the Skripals \u2013 targeted with the Soviet-designed nerve agent Novichok \u2013 Prime Minister Theresa May had become more forthright in highlighting the values and interests shared by the UK and the EU, including with regard to security and defense. Indeed, at last month\u2019s Munich Security Conference, she proposed a \u201cdeep and special partnership\u201d on such matters.In May\u2019s preferred scenario, the UK would continue to participate fully in EU agencies like EUROPOL, while upholding European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Moreover, the UK would maintain its involvement in existing and future EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) missions, and coordinate with the EU on sanction regimes under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).The attack on the Skripals has surely reinforced May\u2019s interest in ensuring strong security cooperation after Brexit. The kind of external threat that the attack represented is best addressed in cooperation with allies. But can the UK\u2019s allies take May seriously?Those \u201cwho threaten our security,\u201d she said in Munich, \u201cwould like nothing more than to see us fractured\u2026and to see us put debates about mechanisms and means ahead of doing what is most practical and effective in keeping our people safe.\u201d Then, after reiterating that the UK had made a legitimate and democratic decision to leave the EU, she concluded that the ball is the EU\u2019s court. Not to accept her generous offer of close security cooperation would, in her words, amount to putting \u201cpolitical doctrine and ideology\u201d first.The irony of May\u2019s stance has not been lost on the 27 EU states that the UK is leaving behind. After all, by casting doubt on the unity of Europe \u2013 and, indeed, the entire West \u2013 Brexit itself is causing serious damage to European security, all for the sake of political doctrine and ideology.To be sure, hardline Brexiteers like Trade Minister Liam Fox claim that the only external relationship the UK needs to buttress its security is NATO, led by the United States. Yet while NATO will obviously remain the paramount source of security for all of Europe, no one should be willing to entrust their security to US President Donald Trump, who seems to have more contempt for allies than for adversaries like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. As the intelligence chiefs of Britain, France, and Germany warned in a little-noticed joint statement released in Munich, any breakdown in security cooperation between the UK and the EU will have dire consequences.But May cannot expect to maintain the UK\u2019s current level of security cooperation with the EU, especially in the context of the otherwise \u201chard\u201d Brexit she envisages. When the UK departs from the EU, it will lose its right to shape the institutional frameworks that have long buttressed its security. This leaves May with two choices: either she can leave those frameworks behind \u2013 a highly risky move \u2013 or she can accept, at least for the most part, the EU\u2019s terms.For example, the legal framework for security-related data must also cover commercial data. If the UK can tolerate giving jurisdiction in this area to a European high court, as May\u2019s Munich speech seems to suggest, why not in other areas? The European Court of Justice has an impeccable reputation as an independent judicial body \u2013 one that has fairly defended the UK\u2019s own interests many times.Such an approach would generate significant goodwill in the negotiations. This, together with the UK\u2019s considerable security-related assets and expertise, would create space for the country to carve out unique concessions from the EU, such as full-time observer status in the EU\u2019s influential Political and Security Committee.Whether or not such forms of cooperation \u2013 essential to ensuring security in both the UK and the EU \u2013 are realized, however, is far from certain. Though May now seems to hold a more realistic view of the security risks Brexit poses, others in her party remain obstinate.For example, Owen Paterson, a former Conservative cabinet minister, recently suggested doing away with the Good Friday Agreement, which has delivered two decades of peace to Northern Ireland \u2013 a highly reckless statement, given the political sensitivities that the Brexit vote triggered in Ireland. Other Brexiteers, like Environment Minister Michael Gove, are also long-time skeptics of the Good Friday accords. This suggests that, in the eyes of Brexit ideologues, security must take a back seat to their nationalist dreams.Perhaps the recent attack on a former Russian agent in a quiet English country town will be enough to remove the ideological blinders from more Brexiteers, showing them that a \u201cBritain alone\u201d is a \u201cBritain vulnerable.\u201d But it is also possible that by the time the UK\u2019s citizens and leaders see Brexit from their allies\u2019 perspective \u2013 as a selfish and destructive act of betrayal \u2013 it will be too late.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018. www.project-syndicate.org\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "UK aviation could be grounded by \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit", "classes": [], "content": "Commerciial handout image released on 17 November 2009 showing Michael Ryan (R), Vice President and General Manager, Bombardier Aerospace, Belfast, and Northern Ireland Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster  laying a special corner stone to mark the construction of Bombardier's CSeries aircraft wing manufacturing and assembly facility.The UK aerospace industry sees a no-deal Brexit as the \u201cworst case scenario,\u201d according to the sector\u2019s trade body.The ADS (Aerospace, Defence, Security) chief executive Paul Everitt is the latest among industrial opinion leaders to call for regulatory alignment and a customs partnership with the EU.Plane and parts must be certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), that is, an agency that the UK must leave by March 2019.

Salvini is the leader of Lega, a partner in the new incoming Italian government, and a Member of the European Parliament which is a good enough excuse to talk to him unofficially, of course.The sudden wave of warnings shows the level of panic in the Commission when it began to realise what the immediate future would look like.Anti-establishment parties won the election in Italy, if only marginally, which means that if it will not be politically possible to produce a government for the time being there will be new snap elections shortly, with a landslide victory by Lega and their 5-Star Movement (M5S) anti-establishment counterparts.In such an election, M5S cannot expect to increase in their share of seats in the Italian Parliament. Lega, however, which is in the eyes of Italians as a part of the traditional political parties and is currently riding a wave of victorious momentum, will get votes from the losers of the same family \u2013 former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia and Partito Democratico, which was led by ex-PM Matteo Renzi until their resounding defeat in the March election.Brussels must, therefore, understand that from now on it does not have to negotiate with Renzi or Paolo Gentiloni, another former prime minister from Italy\u2019s recent past, but with Salvini and Di Maio.The three warnings by the Commission were an inappropriate signal because give ground to both M5S and Lega to focus the next electoral campaign on a possible referendum for Itexit \u2013 an Italian exit from the European Union. And this case is in no way similar to that of the United Kingdom as Italy is in the Eurozone and a founding Member State of the EU.The real problem of the European Union during this wave of anti-establishment sentiments is confined solely to the UK or Italy. The problem is that because of the extended austerity programmes, over-regulation, and immigration, heterodox insurgent forces became the new political trend in Europe. If it is not tackled now, at the early embryonic stage, it may well take on the dimension of a catastrophic avalanche in the not-so-distant future.This is what the European Commission must handle as the alternative to dismemberment.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n"}{"head": "The UK wants a chair at Europol after Brexit", "classes": [], "content": "Europol Director Rob Wainwright during a press conference in Brussels, Belgium, 05 April 2016.

In the words of the Irish Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar, the main political issue is that the UK government does not have a parliamentary or even cabinet majority for any solution.The next landmark date on the calendar is the EU Council in October, six months before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.The IMF is warning this could cost EU economies a collective 1,5% in growth by 2030 if the UK falls back on World Trade Organisation trade rules. The hit would be hardest for Ireland, followed by the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Malta, Cyprus, and Luxembourg.For the UK, there seems to be a more short-term effect as the pound is eroding purchasing power.In the short run, the UK could expect growth decelerating by 2% of its GDP.The prospect of hard Brexit is already causing damage.

In a similar poll April last year, only 31% of people supported a second referendum.Over the past couple of months, the idea of a vote on the terms of the deal with the option of remaining in the EU has been gaining momentum. Several politicians have come out and given their opinion on a second referendum.Euronews asked MPs from the 'remain' and 'leave' camp what they think.Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and WallingtonOn whether there should be a referendum on the final Brexit deal:\"Yes, there should definitely be a final say on the deal or a vote on the deal. We are not calling it a second referendum because that implies that it\u2019s just a rerun of the first one. This is not a re-run of the first referendum. This is a referendum on the deal that the UK government will have reached with the European Union or possibly no-deal if that\u2019s what they arrive at.\"What we want, and I think that this is what the people want as well, is that the people be given a chance to either vote for the deal the government reaches \u2014 and I hope they do reach one \u2014 or staying in the EU.\"What should the referendum look like?\"It should be a two-part question, which is either people can vote for the deal the government has reached or they can vote to stay in the European Union.\"Sir David Amess, Conservative MP for Southend WestOn whether there should be a referendum on the final Brexit deal:\"I have been an MP for 35 years and never thought that we would be given the chance to vote again on our membership of the EU. I was absolutely delighted and surprised by the result, I had voted 'no' in the first referendum. There will not be a second referendum or a people's vote, the whole proposition is absolutely ridiculous and it is not going to happen. We will have left the EU by the end of March next year and I welcome the fact. It is now in everyone\u2019s interest to make sensible arrangements for Britain\u2019s departure. I have no doubt at all that future generations of Britons will be very pleased that we have left the EU.\"\"I only ever wanted us to trade our goods and services, have strong educational and cultural links and work together on security and defence matters but I have always been opposed to a United States of Europe with one government, one currency, one foreign policy and one defence policy, not least because we are a proud trading nation who are hardly prepared to be subservient to other nations.\"For a second referendum to take place before the deadline in March 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May's agreement with the EU would have to be rejected by UK Parliament. In that case, a referendum is a possible solution to the political deadlock that would ensue.Read More | How the UK's Brexit process works in one chartHowever, a referendum needs an Act of Parliament, which needs to obtain a majority of MPs' votes and, even if it got a majority of the votes, the legislative process to establish one can be lengthy.

So it is increasingly unlikely there's enough time to organise a second referendum ahead of the UK's deadline to leave the EU."}{"head": "The case for a hard Brexit: why it might not be all doom and gloom", "classes": [], "content": "The case for a hard Brexit: why it might not be all doom and gloomThis article has been updated to take account of Theresa May's plan unveiled at Chequers on July 6 and the subsequent resignations of government ministers.There have long been warnings that either a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d or a \u201cno-deal scenario\u201d would be damaging for the EU, and catastrophic for the UK.Brexit supporters have always dismissed such ominous tidings as \u201cProject Fear\u201d, and the recent sudden surge of alarm from business has done nothing to change their minds.Most of those cast as Brexiteers say they want to see an agreement between London and Brussels. However, they have turned one of Theresa May\u2019s slogans into a mantra: \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d.They argue that by standing firm, Brussels will bend. Although EU insiders point out that defending its principles \u2013 protecting the single market and ruling out \u201ccherry-picking\u201d from EU rules, for instance \u2013 are a matter of survival for the bloc.For Brexiteers however, freedom from EU ties paves the way for a bright future for \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d. In contrast, sticking close to EU rules and regulations would not be a true Brexit and therefore would undermine the results of the people's vote.Above all, they say the UK could thrive even if no accord is struck by the time of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU in March 2019.  Their arguments have been put into sharp focus by the high-profile resignations from the government of two of their champions: the ex-Brexit minister David Davis, and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.  The prime minister and her government have often defined Brexit as being about \u201ctaking back control\u201d: after it leaves the EU, Britain will control its own borders, laws, and money.Theresa May has long said that the UK may choose to stay close to EU rules and standards \u2013 but sovereignty, decision-making and judicial oversight will come back across the Channel from the continent.However, her red lines have become increasingly blurred as compromises have been made over financial contributions to the EU, immigration, jurisdiction and more.Recently May has been widely seen as increasingly steering the country towards a softer Brexit, out of tune with her earlier robust statements. Her latest plan unveiled to ministers at Chequers as the blueprint for proposals to be put to the EU, has brought fears that it will not mean Brexit but BRINO \u2013 \u201cBrexit In Name Only\u201d.Brexiteers argue that the UK needs to stop being tied to the EU\u2019s apron strings, in order to have the freedom to do trade deals around the world.They say there are massive opportunities to trade internationally. Britain\u2019s future lies in developing markets outside the European Union, with places like Asia representing an ever-increasing slice of world growth. In contrast, some say, Europe is in decline.Adhering to \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d with EU rules and regulations in order to keep trading smoothly means the UK will become a \u201crule-taker\u201d outside the bloc with no say.Not only that, they argue that striking trade deals outside the EU would become harder to do \u2013 as freedom to meet other countries\u2019 demands would be restricted.They are looking for an accord with Brussels that has been described as \u201cSuperCanada\u201d or \u201cCanada+++\u201d, a free trade agreement based on Canada\u2019s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) \u2013 arguing that such a prize has even been offered by European Council President Donald Tusk.Under a \u201cno-deal scenario\u201d, the UK would conduct its trade under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.This is widely interpreted as meaning higher tariffs, but Brexiteers dispute this. They argue that Britain could lead the way in cutting tariffs to zero to ensure seamless free trade.\u201cWe don\u2019t want any tariffs anywhere, and under those conditions a newly independent UK, outside the customs union, outside the single market, outside the ECJ (European Court of Justice)\u2026 will have access to the world,\u201d former UK government minister Owen Paterson told BBC Radio. \u201cOur current European suppliers, who we value a lot, will have to compete on world terms. That will bring prices down for every business and every single family.\u201dTariffs are not the only barrier to trade. Businesses also point out that EU rules mean no border checks, enabling complex supply chains to operate smoothly, delivering components \u201cjust-in-time\u201d.Brexiteers advocate a maximum facilitation or \u201cMaxFac\u201d proposal for life outside the customs union. An existing \u201ctrusted trader\u201d scheme could be extended. Customs checks could be carried out via electronic surveillance, including vehicle number plate recognition technology.They detest an alternative \u201cCustoms Partnership\u201d scheme \u2013 May\u2019s latest plan is seen as a variation of it \u2013 arguing it\u2019s likely to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, tie the UK to product regulations, and preclude future trade deals.Brussels doesn\u2019t like either proposal, leading to much anticipation over how it will respond to May\u2019s \u201cthird way\u201d plan.The UK and the EU are committed to maintaining an open border between a future Northern Ireland outside the bloc, and the Republic of Ireland which is an EU member.Avoiding a hard border has been seen as trying to square a circle, virtually impossible if the UK leaves the customs union and single market.Some Brexiteers argue that the danger of a hard border is overstated, and does not threaten the Good Friday Agreement that ended 30 years of sectarian strife.An open border with no physical infrastructure is still possible, they say. Dublin and Belfast already diverge on many matters including tax and excise duties, unproblematic for peace and stability.Immigration can still be controlled, and anyway the Common Travel Area enabled free movement across the border for 50 years before EU membership.For goods, customs controls will indeed be needed after Brexit but that doesn\u2019t need to involve border checks or infrastructure. On standards, the fact products start from a position of regulatory alignment will help.A common Brexiteer assertion is that Brussels, Dublin and Remainers play up the \u201cintractable\u201d Irish border problem as a matter of political expediency.Brexiteers want Theresa May to stick to her pledge that \u201cour laws\u2026 will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across this country\u201d. The government has vowed that jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) will end \u201con the day the UK leaves the EU\u201d.However, the UK has conceded that the ECJ will continue to have influence on British court decisions. Under the agreement over a transition period until the end of 2020, it will continue to have jurisdiction.Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of the Conservative European Research Group, are alarmed that the government\u2019s latest plans \u201cmay even leave some sort of backdoor role\u201d for the European court. \u201cThis would be a deeply unsatisfactory non-Brexit,\u201d he told the BBC.\u201cThe European Court of Justice should be recognised in the same way as the Supreme Court of the United States is recognised. It has authority over its own territory, and over what goes on within its territory and with agencies that are covered by it. It ought to have no writ within the United Kingdom,\u201d he argued.On trade, he says the ECJ naturally has jurisdiction in the European Union \u2013 but not over goods that enter, are sold or made in the UK, unless they are exported to the EU.Brexiteers are often staunchly adamant that a good deal is there to be done with the EU. They reject as \u201ctotally wrong\u201d claims that ministers have no chance of striking a \u201cbespoke\u201d agreement, Theresa May\u2019s stated intention.The EU is accused of trying to intimidate the UK into accepting a bad deal, for fear of having none. The government should call Brussels\u2019 bluff and make it clear that Britain is not scared of \u2013 and has prepared for \u2013 the infamous \u201cno-deal\u201d.Many, like Howard Flight \u2013 a Conservative member of the House of Lords \u2013 argue that Britain can strengthen its hand by threatening to withhold its financial settlement if there is no guarantee of a trade agreement.If Brussels refuses to bend, the UK should walk out of the talks, he wrote in BrexitCentral, the pro-Brexit website.\u201cNow is the time to take the lead; to reaffirm what deal is acceptable to us, and if refused, to exit negotiating and rely on the WTO. The reality is that our position is stronger than that of the EU.\u201d"}{"head": "No Deal Brexit isn't an option | View", "classes": [], "content": "No Deal Brexit isn't an option | ViewBy Steve BullockOn Tuesday, the UK minister for Brexit said that the UK government would be making plans to stockpile food to mitigate shortages that would be caused by a No Deal Brexit and ensure that \u201cadequate food\u201d was available. The minister of health also said that his department was working on plans to stockpile essential medicines, devices, and, ominously, \u201csubstances of human origin\u201d. The UK government\u2019s own economic projections predict appalling economic harm from a chaotic No Deal Brexit, with over two million jobs lost, and the poorest regions hit hardest. Over a million UK citizens in the EU would cease to have a legal status overnight. Government policy however remains that \u201cNo Deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. It should be obvious to all now though that it isn\u2019t.There\u2019s a very simple way for the UK government to avoid the utterly dreadful and demeaning effects and equally indignified and costly contingency plans for a No Deal Brexit. The UK government can take it off the table. Exclude it as a possibility, or at least as an option, right now.No deal is not just one of several options for Brexit. It is a total false equivalence to put it, as many do, on an equal footing with a free trade agreement, an EEA+ type agreement, or with remaining in the EU. It\u2019s possible to have a conversation about the pros and cons of each of those. I believe that remaining in the EU would be by far the best option, but I\u2019m happy to admit that the others might at least be possible without having to resort to stockpiling medicines, blood and food.The prime minister believes that threatening no deal is a show of strength, but it is the UK population that is being threatened here, not the EU27. It is not a show of strength. It is a show of weakness, irresponsibility, and, ultimately, failure. A policy that admits No Deal as a live option for the UK represents not just a failure in negotiations, but a failure as a government and as a parliament. It is central to the role of both to avoid a crisis such as this ever occurring, particularly when it would be entirely of their own making.There is no mandate whatsoever for a No Deal Brexit. All discussion on both sides prior to the 2016 referendum was predicated on the basis that there would at least be an orderly, agreed exit, even if there was not a quick agreement on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The push for No Deal (and it is a deliberate push from some) came only late, as an ill-conceived attempt to gain leverage, or at least the approval of the right wing press, from a government realising that it had very little elsewhere.It was never a credible threat, and has never achieved a shred of additional leverage. Having put a menu of options on the table and asked the UK to choose which it prefers, the UK has chosen instead baskets of hand-picked cherries, endless cake and a big portion of burned trust. The EU27 now finds itself in the position of having to prepare itself for No Deal. That it is doing that through careful analysis and planning rather than concessions that would undermine the Single Market shows how little leverage the threat has created.There are very few British MPs actually pushing for this. The 40 or 50 MPs in the hard-right Brexit Ultra European Research Group, and less than a handful of ministers, should not and cannot be all out to drive a country to the brink of disaster like this. Parliament should refuse to consider No Deal as an option, either in votes it holds, or in the referendum on the withdrawal agreement that many in the UK are now calling for. It should not be considered, anymore than the amputation of a leg should be considered to treat a cold.It is the UK government\u2019s responsibility to announce now that it would take every step possible to avoid what would now obviously be a catastrophe for the UK. These can include requesting an extension to Article 50, possible to call a referendum on the deal or a general election, or requesting a suspension or even revocation of Article 50. No amount of embarrassment, loss of face, or concessions in negotiations could be worse than the prospect of shortages of essentials and the civil unrest that could follow. Through either, lives could be ruined or lost.If the government will not take it off the table, MPs, the media and the UK population must. They must make it clear that, even as a possibility, it is unacceptable. The UK media has to stop covering this as just another story, and get over the seriousness of what\u2019s at stake. MPs must show real honesty and fortitude.Extreme Brexiters will howl that this is appeasement. It isn\u2019t. There\u2019s nobody to appease. Negotiations are with the UK\u2019s closest allies, friends, partners and neighbours. This is not an external threat, foisted onto the UK government against its will. The threat of no deal is an internal threat, caused by its own decisions and willingness to drag the country it governs over a cliff.This is not a question of Leave vs. Remain, hard vs. soft Brexit, or europhile vs. eurosceptic. It is responsibility vs. Irresponsibility; security vs. insecurity; public safety vs. harm to a population; a future vs. a disaster. It should be nixed now.In addition to repeated signals from the leaders of EU institutions and several Member States that the UK can decide to stop Brexit if it wishes, there are now signals that EU27 would be prepared to consider an extension to Article 50 for the UK to complete democratic processes. The Irish T\u00e1naiste Simon Coveney has said Ireland would support a UK request for an extension. The Government should begin discussions on this immediately.The government can then do its job and negotiate an agreement and a framework for a future relationship. Parliament, and if needs be the people, can then decide whether they prefer that agreement, or its only real alternative, which is to stay a member of the EU. This is the only remotely responsible route for our political leaders to take. Anything else is irresponsible madness.Steve Bullock is a former negotiator for the UK in the EU, and has also worked in the European Commission and Whitehall.

Ongoing negotiations between the British government and the European Commission reach a crucial point at the end of June at an EU summit in Brussels.Arguments have raged: between London and Brussels, \u201cLeavers\u201d and \u201cRemainers\u201d. Economic orthodoxy has been pitted against increasingly important themes such as identity and culture. Key points have become lost in the war of words as the process drags on.To help cut through the fog, here are Euronews\u2019 answers to 10 key questions (they may be updated regularly as events unfold):The UK voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union \u2013 an economic and political partnership of 28 countries \u2013 at a referendum in June 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty in March 2017 to set in motion the formal two-year process towards Brexit. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019.The June summit has been billed as a deadline for the UK to produce answers on key unresolved questions, but there are fears this will slip until the autumn.By then both sides hope to reach a draft deal on future ties. This would then be put to the European Council\u2019s 27 national leaders at a summit in October. At least 20 countries representing 65 percent of the EU\u2019s population, as well as the European Parliament, must approve it.The UK Parliament must also approve a final deal. British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s flagship Brexit legislation has been going through the House of Commons and the House of Lords.The largely pro-EU upper house has inflicted several defeats on the government, sending its plans back to the elected chamber. There, the government\u2019s precarious situation has made it vulnerable to internal rebellions from rival camps with opposing visions of Brexit.Two years after the referendum, the UK is still wrestling with a fundamental question over Brexit. The extent to which it should seek to diverge from EU rules and standards, and risk sacrificing the benefits of close ties, has sparked a monumental political debate. Brussels has repeatedly accused the British government of lacking clarity over its aims.Brexiteers say it\u2019s about taking back control of the UK\u2019s laws, money and borders. At the same time, Theresa May has said she wants the UK and the EU to remain close partners.After taking office, the prime minister pledged to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the UK, to end \u201cfree movement\u201d for EU citizens into the UK, and to stop Britain\u2019s \u201cvast contributions\u201d to the EU budget. The UK intends to leave the EU\u2019s single market \u2013 which involves accepting free movement \u2013 but wants the best possible access to it via a new free trade agreement with the EU.Britain also seeks freedom to strike free trade deals with non-EU countries \u2013 which means leaving the EU\u2019s customs union, as this ties members in to EU policy in imposing common external tariffs.The European Union\u2019s objective has been to preserve its own unity and the integrity of internal arrangements such as the single market and customs union. Leaders have consistently warned that these would be undermined if the UK is allowed to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d from the rules, or \u201chave its cake and eat it\u201d by benefitting from the advantages without accepting the obligations.At the outset, the European Commission \u2013 mandated by EU leaders to conduct negotiations \u2013 quickly established priority issues concerning the UK\u2019s departure to be resolved before future relations could be considered. These were the UK\u2019s financial dues, the rights of EU and UK citizens, and avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.As for future ties, the EU wants a free trade agreement \u2013 without offering the UK the same benefits as membership \u2013 and a level playing field via an alignment of rules and standards.EU leaders see Brexit as a damage-limitation exercise which balances the need to protect the economy and preserve good future relations, against the political imperative of ensuring the UK does not emerge better off from leaving the bloc.Deadlock on the initial separation issues was broken in December 2017. Agreement was reached in Brussels on the UK\u2019s financial settlement, citizens\u2019 rights, and on the principles over Irish border arrangements.An accord was then struck in March this year on a transition phase \u2013 May\u2019s government prefers the term \u201cimplementation period\u201d \u2013 to run from Brexit Day in March 2019 until December 31, 2020. Many existing arrangements will remain in place to allow time to prepare for, and determine, new rules. The UK will be able to negotiate new trade deals but they won\u2019t come into force until 2021.On money, the UK has agreed to pay into the EU budget as now until the current round ends in 2020. It may incur in future new liabilities agreed before then. The British government estimates the settlement will cost \u20ac40-45 billion.Agreement to keep the Irish border open \u2013 with no physical infrastructure such as customs posts or cameras \u2013 was consolidated in March 2018 into a draft legal document. If all else fails, the UK will \u201cmaintain full alignment\u201d with single market and customs union rules to guarantee no hard border.EU citizens in the UK and Britons living on the continent will retain current rights to live and work on each side of the Channel right through the transition period until the end of 2020.The record so far shows that London has made more concessions than Brussels. For instance, Theresa May has accepted that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) will continue to have influence in the UK, though it can no longer be the ultimate arbiter of the law.Details concerning the UK\u2019s future trading ties with the EU go to the heart of the Brexit debate. The government is split \u2013 reflecting the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s divisions \u2013 and weakened by its fragile position in Parliament.Future customs arrangements have become one of the main Brexit sticking points. Under the EU\u2019s customs union, countries impose a common tariff on goods coming from outside \u2013 which then circulate freely across national borders within the union without duties or checks. They cannot set their own import taxes.Theresa May\u2019s government is committed to leaving the customs union in order to pursue an independent trade policy and be able to strike deals with countries around the world.For Brexiteers who want a clean break from the EU\u2019s system, the question has become a litmus test on whether the UK is really \u2018out\u2019 of the EU. Pro-Europeans argue that some kind of customs union with the EU is necessary to avoid major disruption to trade and supply chains, inflicting serious economic damage.The government wants trade with the EU to be as frictionless as possible but ministers have been unable to agree on a suitable customs model. They have been considering two possible options \u2013 a customs partnership and a \u201cmaximum facilitation\u201d arrangement \u2013 but the EU has greeted both with outright scepticism.The House of Lords has proved to be a thorn in the government\u2019s side, passing amendments to its Brexit bill which will have to be considered when it returns to the House of Commons. They insist on a customs union arrangement and continued membership of the European Economic Area) (EEA) \u2013 which includes full access to the European single market.This raises the question of whether the UK could adopt a so-called \u201cNorway model\u201d \u2013 the non-EU country is a member of the EEA \u2013 but the government is hostile as it would mean accepting the free movement of people.Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn also rejects EEA membership for the same reasons, however his Labour Party has continued to soften its stance on Brexit. It wants a new customs union and now calls for \u201cfull access\u201d to the single market, outside of full membership.The politics concerning the various options are complicated, but the outcome will determine how smooth trade will be between the UK and the EU \u2013 as well as the nature of the Irish border.Leading Brexiteers such as Liam Fox and Boris Johnson argue that the UK surrenders its trade policy to Brussels if it remains in a customs union with the EU.They say that being outside the EU will enable Britain to exploit new opportunities, with the trade secretary highlighting services and digital industries.Johnson has argued that changing trade patterns make the EU less important for the UK. Figures show that the proportion of UK exports going to the EU has fallen over the past decade, although their value has risen.The foreign secretary has cited the attraction of countries such as South Korea, where UK exports have doubled in recent years. Part of that success is due to the EU\u2019s trade agreement with Seoul. After Brexit the UK risks losing such deals, although supporters say terms could still be applied.The UK should be able to negotiate new trade deals more easily than the EU, they argue, because talks will no longer have to cater for more than two dozen countries\u2019 special interests.Several countries have been mooted as possible candidates for free trade deals with the UK, including the United States, China, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It has been claimed, however, that some may seek significant concessions from the UK.The question of the UK\u2019s future trade relationship with the EU is also relevant to one of the key goals agreed by both sides: avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland \u2013 part of the UK and in future outside the EU \u2013 and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.During the 30-year \u201cTroubles\u201d of the late 20th century, the border was heavily fortified and a focal point for tension and violence. People and goods crossing it were stopped for customs and identity checks.The 1998 Good Friday peace agreement paved the way for an open border. Security measures disappeared and the EU\u2019s single market and customs union removed the need for inspections. However, political tensions remain between Irish nationalists and Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists \u2013 which it\u2019s believed could be inflamed should a hard border return \u2013 although some hardline Brexiteers believe the Irish border issue has been overblown.With the UK intending to leave the single market and customs union after Brexit, the question of how to avoid border controls is unresolved. Brussels\u2019 suggestion that Northern Ireland remain part of the EU\u2019s customs territory has been rejected out of hand by Theresa May and Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) \u2013 on whose support her government relies \u2013 as it risks creating another border between the North\u2019s six counties and the rest of the UK.The British government\u2019s preferred solution is for a new free-trade agreement and customs deal with the EU, avoiding the need for border checks. Failing that, it believes technology and \u201ctrusted trader\u201d schemes can be implemented. Brussels is nonplussed.The prime minister\u2019s latest proposal for a \u201cbackstop solution\u201d, involving the UK matching EU tariffs temporarily, has prompted internal dissent in her Cabinet.The draft treaty drawn up in March highlights more unresolved issues: they include governance of the Brexit deal and how to resolve disputes, the extent of ECJ jurisdiction in the UK, nuclear material, intellectual property, and security and defence cooperation.The UK\u2019s future access to Galileo, the EU\u2019s satellite project, is uncertain. There is uncertainty over cooperation in scientific research. Brexit poses challenges for the UK over tax policy, particularly VAT.Despite broad agreement on citizens\u2019 rights, campaigners argue there is confusion surrounding the UK\u2019s plans to give EU nationals \u201csettled status\u201d and there are fears that administrative problems may cause injustice.The question also remains over whether UK nationals will have the right to retain EU citizenship after Brexit, giving them the right to travel, live, study and work throughout the bloc. A court case is pending before the ECJ.There have been repeated warnings from business about the need for the UK to retain close access to European markets. In May a delegation of Europe\u2019s biggest industrial companies met Theresa May and warned that they would not invest in Britain as long as uncertainty over Brexit persisted.Government-commissioned economic analysis suggests being outside customs union would hit growth. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has highlighted the need for single market access for services, which make up 80 percent of the UK economy.The car industry in the UK and on the continent relies on integrated supply chains and frictionless borders. There\u2019ve been reports that EU carmakers may seek to exclude British parts. The road haulage industry is worried about potential disruption.The pharmaceutical industry is encouraged by the UK\u2019s wish to keep close links to the European Medicines Agency, but question marks remain over practicalities.The British government has promised an overhaul of farming subsidies, food production and the environment once the UK is outside the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The fishing industry is looking forward to taking back control of its coastal waters but will have to wait, as the UK will remain in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) during the transition period.Many businesses also want access to European workers and are concerned about future restrictions. Alarm bells have already rung over labour shortages in sectors from construction to the health service, tourism to fruit farms. Hostility to the free movement of EU workers was one of the main reasons for the referendum result, but the British government has still to unveil its post-Brexit immigration policy.Reports quoting government analysis have suggested that some parts of the UK which voted strongly for Brexit will be most heavily impacted, if there is no deal.The head of the UK\u2019s customs service has estimated that even with agreement on the Brexiteers\u2019 favoured customs plan, the bureaucratic cost to business may reach \u00a320 billion (\u20ac22.8 billion) - a claim hotly disputed by Brexiteers.Theresa May\u2019s famous Brexit mantra is that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. \u201cA no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone\u2026 but above all for the UK,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk has said.For both sides, failure to reach a deal could bring economic, political and legal chaos at least in the short-term. No agreement could see the UK refuse to settle the withdrawal bill, blowing a big hole in the EU budget. EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent may find their status up in the air again.On trade, World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would apply. Tariffs would be imposed at varying rates. Experts say this would increase costs for UK importers and exporters, raising prices particularly for food. Border controls and customs checks would also increase costs.Brexit supporters argue that the lack of an agreement is no barrier to trade, and the UK could cut or get rid of tariffs altogether. Boris Johnson has suggested the UK would \u201cdo very well\u201d under such an arrangement.Non-tariff barriers would hit services, which now operate across the EU via \u201cpassporting\u201d rights. The UK would be outside EU regulatory agencies, threatening sectors such as pharmaceuticals and aviation.The UK has been accused of failing to prepare for customs checks and a \u201cno deal scenario\u201d generally \u2013 even by some \u201cLeave\u201d supporters.The EU knows that both sides would be damaged by a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario. Ireland especially, its economy so closely linked to Britain, could be particularly badly hit. It\u2019s one reason why hardline Brexiteers argue that the UK should threaten to walk out of talks \u2013 to force Brussels to make concessions.Brexit has been described as the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant change since it joined the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, and perhaps since World War II.The fallout from the referendum has exacerbated tensions within the United Kingdom. Scotland voted heavily to remain in the EU, and the result revived questions concerning Scottish independence from the UK \u2013 which was rejected in a 2014 referendum. The Irish border conundrum is intensified by the fact that a majority in Northern Ireland wanted the UK to stay in the EU.Theresa May\u2019s position has been weakened since her government lost its majority in the June 2017 general election. It\u2019s now propped up in Parliament thanks to an agreement with Northern Ireland unionists from the DUP.Arguably, the ruling Conservatives' internal divisions over Brexit have cancelled each other out and kept May in power. Both sides fear that toppling her might bring chaos \u2013 and possibly a hard-left Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile the pro-EU Liberal Democrats remain a marginal force, despite the growth of a number of anti-Brexit grassroots organisations.The consequences of Brexit are being felt on the continent too. The European Union is losing an existing member for the first time, along with a significant chunk of its budget. It\u2019s a major test of the EU\u2019s ability to withstand the rising tide of Euroscepticism \u2013 and calls into question the drive for closer European integration.For more on the history of the UK\u2019s troubled relationship with Europe, see our earlier four-part series here, here, here and here."}{"head": "A no-deal Brexit will have \"big\" economic consequences", "classes": [], "content": "A no-deal Brexit will have \"big\" economic consequencesA no-deal Brexit will have \"big\" economic consequences.That's according to the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who says it'll prompt a review of interest rates and leave many bankers idle.Carney says Lenders, insurers and asset managers are playing safe by opening new EU hubs by March.They hope to maintain links with customers irrespective of whether a transition deal or generous future trading terms are secured.But there are fears existing cross-border contracts would be disrupted without a transition deal.Mark Carney also says it's too soon to judge what the government's proposals will mean for financial services.Britain says it'll legislate to ensure \"continuity\" in contracts and that the EU must reciprocate but the bloc says it was up to banks and not public authorities to get ready."}{"head": "Why we need a people's vote on the Brexit deal | View", "classes": [], "content": "Why we need a people's vote on the Brexit deal | View\"Let's face it, nobody thinks this is going well,\" said Femi Oluwole of Brexit negotiations.The co-founder of Our Future, Our Choice!, a British pro-European Union advocacy group for young people, told Euronews why he's campaigning for a second Brexit referendum.Citing lack of control in the hands of voters concerning the UK's future relationship with the EU as one of the main reasons he's calling for a new vote.\"650 people sitting in Westminster, they get to decide our new relationship with the EU, you just have to sit and wait,\" he said.Femi also said Britain would see a loss of control and lose influence in the EU after Brexit, adding that the National Health Service will be negatively impacted as it relies on staff from EU countries.\"The only logical and democratic thing to right now is a people's vote on the Brexit deal,\" he concluded.Watch Femi put forward his argument in the video above.The opinions expressed in View articles do not reflect those of Euronews"}{"head": "How the UK's Brexit process works in one chart", "classes": [], "content": "How the UK's Brexit process works in one chartWill Brexit bring a deal or \u201cno-deal\u201d? The question has dominated the recent debate over the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.In fact, multiple scenarios are possible in the next few, decisive months as the clock ticks towards March 29, 2019. A UK think-tank has set out in graph form the different ways in which the negotiations and politics could play out.The Institute for Government \u2013 a charity dedicated to making government more effective \u2013 concludes that the outcome is very hard to predict.However \u2013 arguing that the risk of a \u201cno-deal\u201d is quite high \u2013 it details the numerous hurdles to an orderly Brexit, and the process each situation would lead to.Four of the five illustrated scenarios look at what would happen if there is a failure to reach or approve an agreement.That doesn\u2019t mean there is only a one-in-five chance of a deal leading to an orderly Brexit. But it does highlight the several different ways in which the process could go wrong for Theresa May\u2019s government.Follow the left-hand column down from Scenario 1 at the top \u2013 this illuminates the green path to an \u201corderly Brexit\u201d, meaning a 21-month transition and detailed talks on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.In this scenario, all hurdles are overcome as negotiations in Brussels bring a deal between the UK and the remaining (EU27) countries on a withdrawal agreement. This is then approved by the British Parliament which has been granted a so-called \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d.The outcome is subject to the proviso that Parliament does not put a spanner in the works by trying to change the deal or bind the government\u2019s hands in talks on the future. It also assumes that the European Parliament ratifies the deal.Here, the British Parliament decides to reject the agreement the prime minister brings back from Brussels. It also accepts that this will mean Brexit taking place with no deal.By law the government is then obliged to set out how it intends to proceed and bring a \u201cneutral motion\u201d before Parliament. The think-tank says that an attempt to renegotiate the deal \u2013 or persuade Parliament to change its mind \u2013 would bring a political crisis.In this scenario, again a deal is struck between the UK and the EU27. However, it is rejected by the British Parliament, which sends the government back to Brussels to renegotiate.What exactly would happen is uncertain, but the Institute for Government says it would depend on the time available, the EU\u2019s willingness to reopen negotiations, and the need for any new deal, in turn, to be approved by Parliament. Otherwise, the outcome would still be a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit.The fourth scenario sees the continuing stand-off in Brussels bring no deal on the UK\u2019s EU withdrawal, as both sides find it impossible to resolve their differences.Here, as in scenario 2, the government informs Parliament of its plans and brings a neutral motion. Parliament takes note and the UK heads towards \u201cno deal\u201d.Again the talks in Brussels bring no deal \u2013 but here, the British Parliament refuses to accept such an outcome. Instead, it sends the government back to renegotiate.Parliament\u2019s precise role in such circumstances is uncertain and brought fierce debate and an eventual fudge as the government\u2019s Brexit legislation was passed earlier this summer.The same issues as in scenario 3 could be raised \u2013 but under an even more compressed timetable.The Institute for Government concludes that \u201cthe risks of either a deliberate or an accidental no deal are quite high\u201d.It says the lack of a parliamentary majority for \u201cno deal\u201d means the government could be sent back to renegotiate a better deal. But time constraints increase the pressure for the prime minister to find a majority for an agreement, which is \u201ceasier said than done\u201d.The high risk of a stalemate in Parliament could lead to an acrimonious and potentially disruptive \u201cno deal\u201d, the think-tank says.The situation is further complicated by the UK\u2019s political and parliamentary landscape. A stalemate could bring various parliamentary manoeuvres to break the deadlock, a Conservative Party leadership election, a general election \u2013 or even a second referendum, the institute says, although it argues that this would be practically difficult."}{"head": "EU citizens must pay \u20ac74 to stay in UK after Brexit", "classes": [], "content": "EU citizens must pay \u20ac74 to stay in UK after BrexitEuropean Union citizens will have to pay up to \u00a365 (\u20ac74) to stay in the UK as part of its settlement scheme after Brexit, the government announced on Thursday.Here are the main things to know about the scheme:  EU citizens will be asked to prove their identity, that they have no criminal convictions and that they currently live in the UK;  The application process will open later in the year, no set date has been given yet;  Applications are to be made online or through an Android app and will cost \u00a365 (\u20ac74) for adults and \u00a332.5 (\u20ac37) for children;  The government\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d position will be to grant, and not refuse, settled status, said Britain\u2019s Home Secretary Sajid Javid;  Decisions on applications will take \u201ca matter of days\u201d instead of the current six-month delay for residency permits.  Under UK plans outlined last year, EU residents who have been continuously and lawfully living in the UK for five years by 31 December 2020 \u2014 when the Brexit transition period expires \u2014 will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting settled status.Those who arrive before the end of the transition period but who have not resided in the UK for the required five-year threshold will be able to apply to stay until they have reached it and apply for settled status.Settled status or temporary permission to stay will grant EU citizens the same access as they currently do to healthcare, pensions and other benefits in the UK.Family members who are living with, or join, EU citizens in the UK by 31 December 2020 will also be able to apply for settled status, usually after 5 years in the UK, while close family members (spouses, civil and unmarried partners, dependent children and grandchildren, and dependent parents and grandparents) will be able to join EU citizens after exit, where the relationship existed on 31 December 2020.Ahead of the settlement scheme announcement, Britain\u2019s Home Secretary Sajid Javid criticised EU countries on Thursday for \u201ctaking far too long\u201d to outline their plans for Britons living on the continent after Brexit.Javid called on EU member states to \u201cset out how they will support British citizens living in their countries.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re taking far too long,\u201d he posted on Twitter.\u201cPublishing details of how we will administer our settled status scheme shows we are honouring the commitments made towards EU citizens living in the UK,\u201d Javid said in a statement.\u201d\u201cBut I am concerned that I have not seen any similar plans on how EU member states are going to support British nationals in their countries. This is not good enough and I hope both the European Parliament and Commission will exert more pressure for them to do this as soon as possible.\u201dThere are 3.8 million EU citizens living in the UK and 900,000 Brits residing in the EU, according to official British statistics.The EU Parliament\u2019s chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, who met with Javid in London earlier in the week, echoed the British minister\u2019s call:\u201cI am far from happy with the treatment of UK citizens in the EU27,\u201d he posted on Twitter on Tuesday.\u201cMost Member States have not yet started the process or procedures,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cboth the UK & the EU have a duty to mitigate the damage of #Brexit for citizens.\u201dJavid is to lay out further details about the settled status scheme today, including when it will be rolled out and will cost \u00a365 (\u20ac74).The government previously said the application for settled status should cost no more than that of a British passport which costs \u00a375.50 (\u20ac86) for an adult, a policy Verhofstadt has criticised.\u201cWhy should EU citizens, who have contributed to British society & paid their taxes, be financially punished for Brexit, when they were denied a vote?,\u201d he posted on Twitter Thursday."}{"head": "UK would be worse off 'in every scenario' post-Brexit: report", "classes": ["video-desc", "speakable-p-1", "p-text", "speakable-p-2", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text", "p-text-last"], "content": "\n    Britain's economy will be worse off after Brexit whether it leaves the EU with a free trade deal, single market access, or with no deal at all, according to leaked government analysis.

May, who lost her\u00a0gamble by holding parliamentary\u00a0elections on June 8 to\u00a0increase her mandate going into the negotiations, is still pledging to make a clean break under the best terms possible.She will negotiate in a weakened position following the elections, which cost her Conservative Party a dozen seats and its majority in Parliament.Other EU members\u00a0vowed to make Britain pay a steep price for a complete exit\u00a0by denying it trade benefits and other advantages of a common market. Monday is the first formal step toward a withdrawal that could take two years to negotiate.In a statement, May's government said it was \"confident it can achieve a bold and ambitious deal that will work in the interest of the whole U.K.\"The EU said it was also looking for a good compromise. The bloc's\u00a0lead negotiator Michel Barnier said Monday that both parties \"must first tackle the uncertainties caused by Brexit \u2014 first for citizens, but also for the beneficiaries of the EU policies and for the impact on borders, in particular Ireland.\"British voters approved a Brexit referendum, 52% to 48%, a year ago. Although\u00a0the country is still deeply divided on the issue, none of the major political parties in the recent vote campaigned against Brexit or pledged to hold a second referendum.Ahead of the vote, May\u00a0had vowed to\u00a0sever ties with the bloc's tariff-free single trading market and end\u00a0reciprocal immigration rights for EU nationals. If dissatisfied with the talks, she even threatened to walk away without paying an expected hefty divorce bill or securing\u00a0a new trade deal.Her\u00a0election setback emboldened new talk within her party of a \"softer\" form of Brexit, which would allow Britain to retain some of its privileges by remaining a member of the EU's common market\"We need a good, clean exit which minimizes disruption and maximizes opportunity,\" hard-line Conservative politician Steven Baker tweeted Tuesday. \"In other words, we need the 'softest' exit consistent with actually leaving and controlling laws, money, border and trade.\"Previously, Baker vehemently opposed any attempts to water down\u00a0terms of Britain's departure from the EU.Former prime ministers David Cameron and Sir John Major have recently\u00a0urged May to rethink her tough Brexit stance.Cameron\u00a0said that May needed to \"consult more widely\" with other parties, including opposition groups such as the Labour Party,\u00a0to figure out what would be in the best interests of the nation and that there was clearly more \"pressure for a soft Brexit.\" Major said that a \"hard Brexit was not endorsed by the electorate.\" Cameron, who had called for the Brexit referendum and campaigned against it, resigned after the June 2016 vote.The EU has refused to engage with Britain about possible Brexit scenarios before the formal negotiations get underway, although\u00a0it has balked at the idea of letting Britain retain access to the single market without also agreeing to continue to allow open immigration among members. Opposition to open EU borders was a big reason Brexit passed.\"The election has made things far less clear,\" said Anand Menon, a foreign affairs expert at King's College London. \"You'd be a fool to try to predict what will happen. I'm limiting myself to saying that the possibility of certain Brexit outcomes has changed.\"Guy Verhofstadt,\u00a0who oversees the EU parliament\u2019s Brexit stance,\u00a0suggested in Strasbourg last\u00a0Wednesday that if Britain changes its mind and decides to return\u00a0to the EU, it would\u00a0be on worse terms.That is wishful thinking, said\u00a0Michael Br\u00f6ning, director of foreign policy\u00a0at Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a Berlin think tank.\u00a0\"Some people\u00a0obviously feel that the election was an opportunity to have an 'exit from the Brexit' but it's not rooted in any real development,\" he said.

As a result, many British executives worry that customs, immigration and regulatory barriers could\u00a0disrupt their business with the 27 other EU nations.\u00a0\u00a0In response, France and many EU countries are rolling out the red carpet.\"You will find the process as smooth as their Camembert ... or their oysters for that matter,\" said one ad plastered on a double-decker bus that AD Normandie hired to tour London and other British towns.\u00a0The bus parodied the pro-Brexit buses that were part of the Vote Leave campaign.A\u00a0tongue-in-cheek personal ad in a mock newspaper called the Normandy Times ran in British papers\u00a0\u2014 seeking a \u201chot entrepreneur\u201d who \u201cmust have an appetite for business, beautiful coastal walks and long sun-drenched lunches with wine flowing.\u201dTransport for London, which manages the Tube and other mass transit,\u00a0rejected using the ad in its stations and vehicles, calling it \u201ccontroversial.\u201dAbout\u00a030 small- to medium-sized British companies have requested meetings to discuss setting up business in France, said Alexandre Wahl, who heads AD Normandie.\u00a0\u201cA week after the campaign ended, three of them came to Normandy to see what could be possible,\u201d Wahl said.\u00a0\u201cThese companies don\u2019t know what will happen with Brexit, but they are aware things won\u2019t be the same.\u201dCompanies that rely heavily on the EU market \u2014 such as the automotive, aerospace and high-tech industries \u2014\u00a0worry they won\u2019t be able to secure components or hire foreign talent once Britain leaves the EU.\u00a0Some businesses are considering alternative headquarters in the EU. For example, the British budget airline easyJet set up a subsidiary in Austria last year so it can operate flights between EU countries after Brexit.Such moves could continue, although many British businesses are adopting a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach until a final deal is reached between Britain and the EU.\u201cThis is part of a long game,\u201d said Alasdair Darroch of Altios UK, a firm that advises companies on international business development. \u201cNo doubt\u00a0in 10 years time, there will be more divergence in the\u00a0relationship\u00a0between the U.K. and Europe. It\u2019s going to be important for some companies to have a base in Europe where they can keep trading without complications.\"To entice British businesses, Normandy has set up a special zone offering\u00a0tax breaks and grants up to $123,000\u00a0to foreign companies that decamp to France.\u00a0There are also incentives for families to resettle in the area, which is already the home of 8,500 British expatriates\u00a0because of its proximity to both southern England and Paris.This special economic area \u2014\u00a0the first in France \u2014\u00a0will be key to attract\u00a0foreign businesses, said\u00a0Herv\u00e9 Morin, president of the Normandy regional council. \u201cIt\u2019s very well placed because it\u2019s close to the industrial port of Le Havre.\"Normandy\u2019s sweet talk follows similar moves by Paris and other European capitals\u00a0to lure banking giants based in London\u2019s financial district.Shortly after the Brexit referendum passed in June 2016, Paris' La Defense business district plastered billboards at London's Heathrow airport and the London stop for Eurostar trains with the irreverent slogan:\u00a0 \u201cTired of the fog? Try the Frogs!\u201dThe moves come as French President Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, wants to capitalize on Brexit woes to attract foreign investments and shake France\u2019s reputation as being unfriendly to business because of high taxes and maddening bureaucracy.Central to Marcon\u2019s vision is to beef\u00a0up France's financial sector, which is tiny compared to London. No big banks have left London so far, but large American and British banks have proposed expanding their offices in France as Brexit approaches.More: London, Paris teaming up to attract international touristsMore: Sacre bleu!

Ahead of the vote, here's a guide to what's being called \"Brexit.\"WHAT IS 'BREXIT'?It's a combination of the words \"British\" and \"exit\" and refers to the potential\u00a0departure of Britain from the EU, a 28-nation economic and political alliance. The EU was founded in 1993, but its\u00a0origins\u00a0can be traced back to 1951 when Germany, France and other countries in the region sought to create a peaceful coalition\u00a0in the aftermath of World War II.\"Brexit\" was coined by\u00a0The Economist magazine in 2012. The expression\u00a0is\u00a0also a twist on\u00a0\"Grexit,\" which was used to describe Greece's potential withdrawal from the eurozone, a subset of 19 EU member states that share the euro currency.WHY IS THIS VOTE HAPPENING?British Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold a referendum on the issue as part of his 2015 re-election campaign. Cameron complained that the bloc has evolved\u00a0gradually into a powerful bureaucracy that infringes on British sovereignty and its national interests on issues\u00a0such as trade, immigration, financial and labor regulation and social spending.USA TODAYBrexit - Latest World & National News & Headlines - USATODAY.comCameron recently won concessions from the EU to give Britain more say over these issues and he now favors continued membership in the bloc. However, many\u00a0members of his Conservative Party oppose his position and are campaigning for a Brexit. The anti-immigration, anti-EU\u00a0UK Independence Party, which has gained support because of a backlash against Muslim migrants entering Britain, also is\u00a0campaigning for a Brexit.IS THE VOTE BINDNG?The vote on the question\u00a0\"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\" is not legally binding but\u00a0Cameron has promised to abide by it. If Brexit passes, the British Parliament would have to repeal EU membership laws.Voters must be 18 or older and a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen who resides in Britain. British nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years can also vote. Citizens of EU countries other than\u00a0Ireland, Malta and Cyprus who live in the U.K.\u00a0will not be able to vote.USA TODAYBritain's historic EU referendum to be held on June 23WHY IS THE OUTCOME\u00a0IMPORTANT?The prospect of Britain leaving the EU creates\u00a0vast uncertainty for the alliance at a time it is dealing with a number of major problems, including a growing migration crisis, an unpredictable and increasingly interventionist\u00a0Russia on its eastern flank, and the prospect of more terror attacks.The loss of Britain,\u00a0one of the wealthiest and influential EU nations, could weaken\u00a0the bloc's cohesion and\u00a0effectiveness. The economic impact of a \"Brexit\" also would be significant by reducing trade, investment and economic growth throughout the region, the International Monetary Fund warned. A possible\u00a0exit has investors nervous and could spark a drop in stock markets and volatile swings in currency exchange rates.On May 12, Bank of England governor\u00a0Mark Carney\u00a0warned\u00a0that a\u00a0vote to leave the bloc\u00a0could lead to\u00a0a \"technical recession.\"There also is the question of what it would\u00a0mean\u00a0for the 3\u00a0million EU nationals who live and work in Britain under the EU's free movement of labor laws.\u00a0Also, If Britain leaves the EU, Scotland, which favors remaining in the bloc, likely would push for another\u00a0independence referendum so it would not be forced out. Pro-independence forces narrowly lost a previous referendum.During a visit to London in April, President Obama urged\u00a0Britain to stay in the EU\u00a0because it \"gives (the United States) much greater confidence about the strength of the trans-Atlantic union.\"USA TODAYInfluential London Mayor Boris Johnson joins 'Brexit' campaignIN OR OUT \u2014\u00a0WHICH WAY WILL IT GO?A poll by market research firm Survation for spread-betting company IG published June 21\u00a0said 45% supported \"remain\" and 44% supported \"leave.\" Another\u00a0poll by\u00a0YouGov for\u00a0The Times\u00a0newspaper published late on June 20\u00a0said\u00a042% would vote to remain,\u00a044% would vote to leave, and\u00a09% didn't know.It came after two polls published during\u00a0the weekend before the vote\u00a0suggested\u00a0that support had swung back toward remaining in the EU.Polling is not always reliable in the U.K.\u00a0The British polling industry incorrectly predicted a neck-and-neck\u00a0race last May between Britain's two main parties, Conservative and Labour.

A poll\u00a0published in October by YouGov, an online research firm, showed 47% of Brits thought the country\u00a0was wrong to vote to leave the EU, compared to\u00a042% who said it was the right thing to do.The same YouGov study found that just\u00a018% want a\u00a0second vote\u00a0and only\u00a014% would opt to abandon Brexit\u00a0completely. A slight majority, 52%, think Brexit should \"go ahead.\"Jon Worth, an expert\u00a0on\u00a0EU affairs\u00a0who is staunchly pro-EU, said he does not see a second national vote until there are more dramatic Brexit impacts on ordinary life.\u00a0\"Brexit\u00a0hasn't yet\u00a0entered into everyday peoples' consciousness,\" he said.Here are the current negative consequences of Brexit on the U.K.:Britain has agreed to pay the EU\u00a0$54\u00a0billion\u00a0to honor existing budget commitments on everything from EU officials' pensions to investments in European\u00a0infrastructure.\u00a0The bill could climb\u00a0before the country leaves the EU in\u00a0March 2019.More: Brexit: UK Parliament backs final say in EU divorce, delivering major blow to Theresa MayThe RAND Corp. published a study this week that\u00a0suggests Britain is likely to be economically worse off outside of the EU under most scenarios.\u00a0For example, RAND's analysis shows\u00a0that if Britain leaves the EU without agreeing to a new trade deal with the bloc,\u00a0its\u00a0GDP could lose\u00a05%, or\u00a0$140 billion, over 10 years.Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, said that due to volatility in currency markets and an increasingly uncertain business environment, Brexit\u00a0has already knocked about 1% off of Britain's GDP.\u00a0\"We have a reasonably good idea of what's happened so far. What comes next\u00a0ranges\u00a0from 'no impact' to pretty serious,'\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0In the year after the June 2016 vote, the\u00a0British pound lost 16% of its value against the dollar, according to Bloomberg data. There were similar steep declines against the euro.The pound has clawed back\u00a09% of this loss against the dollar\u00a0in 2017,\u00a0but not before pushing\u00a0up inflation, strangling\u00a0wage growth\u00a0and reducing consumer spending power.\u00a0Companies operating\u00a0in Britain's services sector\u00a0\u2014 hotels, restaurants, banks\u00a0\u2014 raised prices in November at the fastest pace in\u00a0nearly a decade, according to data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Many blamed the weaker pound and Brexit-related uncertainty for the acceleration in prices.On the bright side, the weaker pound has boosted U.K. exports and made Britain a more appealing tourism destination for foreigners. Overseas residents made 3.9 million visits to Britain in August, up 5% from\u00a0a year earlier,\u00a0figures released last month by the country's Office for National Statistics\u00a0show.There were 1.9 million visits by U.S. tourists between January and June 2017, up 31% compared to the year earlier, according to VisitBritain, the country's tourism agency.London's status as Europe's financial capital is threatened by Brexit.A key attraction for global banks and financial service firms\u00a0is that Britain\u00a0offers relatively easy access\u00a0in an English-speaking setting\u00a0to markets in\u00a027 other EU countries.However, Brexit could cause a loss of as many as 75,000 jobs in the banking and insurance industry, as major\u00a0firms\u00a0such as\u00a0Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and UBS Group question whether to\u00a0shift operations and staff elsewhere in the EU, Sam Woods, Britain's top banking regulator, told lawmakers last month.In addition, the EU selected\u00a0Paris as\u00a0the new home of the European Banking Authority, the industry's regulator.

Those include the rights of citizens affected by Brexit, Britain\u2019s financial obligations to the EU and how to keep open the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.Leaders of the other 27 EU members are expected to ratify the agreement later this week, allowing Brexit talks to move on to trade and security cooperation. May told Parliament the next phase would not be easy but that the atmospherics have improved.\u201cOf course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,\u201d May said in a statement. \u201cBut there is, I believe, a new sense of optimism now in the talks and I fully hope and expect that we will confirm the arrangements I have set out today in the European Council later this week.\u201dShe said the implementation period she seeks will be discussed in the next phase of the talks, and called for discussions to begin immediately.But weekend comments by the official in charge of the talks have threatened to spoil May\u2019s triumphant moment. In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, Brexit chief David Davis suggested that last week\u2019s agreement was a \u201cstatement of intent\u201d that wasn\u2019t legally binding.The comments caused unease in Ireland, where leaders demanded provisions in the agreement to ensure Brexit won\u2019t restrict travel and trade between the Republic of Ireland and the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland. Officials in both parts of the island say the border must remain open to protect the Irish peace process.The Irish government branded Davis\u2019 comments \u201cbizarre\u201d and insisted that Britain must live up to the commitments it made last week.Davis Monday tried to mitigate the fallout, insisting his words had been \u201ccompletely twisted.\u201d\u201cWhat I actually said yesterday \u2026 was we want to protect the peace process, want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them, and I said this was a statement of intent which was much more than just legally enforceable,\u201d Davis told LBC Radio.\u201cIn the event that the withdrawal agreement doesn\u2019t happen then we would still be seeking to maintain an invisible border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,\u201d he added. \u201cI was making the point that it was much more than just in the treaty, it\u2019s what we want to do anyway.\u201dThe confusion prompted Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to question the government\u2019s competence.\u201cWe respect the result of the referendum but due to this government\u2019s shambolic negotiations it\u2019s getting increasingly difficult to believe this is a government capable of negotiating a good deal for Britain,\u201d he said.More: Brexit: Where the U.K.\u2019s divorce from the EU standsMore: Britain, EU reach 11th-hour deal to keep talking about BrexitMore: No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU's Jean-Claude JunckerHe pressed May for details about the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d Britain will have to pay to leave the EU.In Brussels, the Europeans were thinking about form as well as substance.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that while the deal was not legally binding, it was regarded as a pact of honor.\u201cWe see the joint report of (EU Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier and David Davis as a deal between gentlemen and it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the U.K. government,\u201d he said.

Another 6% said they would definitely not choose Britain to study\u00a0as a result of the Brexit vote.Government\u00a0figures also showed\u00a0the number of Indian students at British universities fell 10% in the past year because of\u00a0concerns about immigration.The loss is costly. According to Oxford Economics, spending by international students in 2014-15 supported 206,600 jobs in U.K. university towns and cities.

In doing so, we have a great opportunity \u2013 and a duty,\u201d May said before her ministers set off for the 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London.\u201cNow is the time for another step forward. We want a deal that allows us to deliver the benefits of Brexit \u2013 taking control of our borders, laws and money and by signing ambitious new trade deals with countries like the U.S, Australia and New Zealand,\u201d she added in a statement.Her effective deputy, cabinet office minister David Lidington, said he was confident that ministers, who have long been at odds over how close Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU should be, would reach a \u201cconcrete position\u201d.The stakes are high.May has been reluctant to spell out her Brexit vision for fear of angering one faction or another.That inaction has frustrated businesses and helped weaken the pound, which is down almost 10 percent since mid-April.The chief executive of European plane-maker Airbus, Tom Enders, accused the government of having \u201cno clue or at least consensus on how to execute Brexit without severe harm\u201d, and defended an earlier warning over the risk to jobs.But with only nine months before Britain leaves the bloc and just over three months before the EU says it wants a deal, she has been forced to act.On Thursday, May made her opening gambit to overcome the deep divisions in not only her government, but in her Conservative Party, parliament and across Britain by suggesting a new customs plan to keep trade flowing as freely as possible.It would see Britain closely mirror EU rules, use technology to determine where goods will end up and therefore which tariffs should be applied, and hand London the freedom to set its own tariffs on incoming goods. Britain would also be able to strike trade deals with other countries, her spokeswoman said.But Brexit campaigners, including at least two ministers in her cabinet, fear that the plan will keep Britain in the EU\u2019s customs sphere.That, Brexit supporters say, would be a betrayal of her pledge for a clean break with the bloc and for Britain to win the ability to strike out alone.Her office has so far made public only a few details of the plan and it may be changed at the Chequers meeting, which is expected to run all day and possibly late into the evening.Even if she finds agreement at home, May still faces the hard task of winning the support of the EU, which poured cold water on her previous suggestions for customs arrangements and pressed her to come up with \u201cworkable\u201d proposals.But for now, May hopes to concentrate minds at home.\u201cThis is about agreeing an approach that delivers decisively on the verdict of the British people \u2013 an approach that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU, and crucially, one that commands the support of the public and parliament,\u201d she said.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

The popularism of left and right is, you know, (at) risk of breaking the back of Western politics,\u201d Blair said.He admitted that \u201cthe centre ground of politics is pretty absent at the moment\u201d \u2014 but denied suggestions he could help form a new centrist party in Britain.His own Labour party has moved to the political left since he was in charge, and while many of its MPs are pro-European, its socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn is more sceptical.Labour backs Brexit but has called for a new customs union with the EU, and has refused to rule out a second vote.Blair said that for all his hopes of stopping Brexit, it depended on \u201cwhether at the top of the Labour party the leader, the people around the leader, still want Brexit to go through\u201d.But he said he hoped it would \u201ccome back to sense\u201d, adding that in the meantime, he would press his case.AFPOver the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

Theresa May, the UK Prime Minister might not have indulged herself in any political song and dance about the events, she knew deep in her mind that it was a \u201cpersonal achievement\u201d, as confirmed by the European Council President Donald Tusk.To the other EU member countries represented by the President of the European Commission Jean Claude-Juncker and other bureaucrats, the success achieved on Friday was commendable. Mr Juncker said:\u00a0 \u201cI believe we have now made the breakthrough we need.\u201dNo one should blame them for allowing a little celebration, after what Mrs May said was made possible by little \u201cgive and take\u201d on both sides.\u00a0 This might be insignificant in the journey towards the final divorce, but I have a feeling the other 27 member countries seem to know that they have Britain\u2019s balls in their palms.Going by the details of the agreement, the majority of citizens who voted to leave during June 23, 2016, referendum are biting their fingernails and wondering if they did not make a mistake. Let\u2019s be honest here, most Leave voters did so to protest EU\u2019s liberal hold on immigration and movement within the union. And by extension the UK\u2019s annual huge bill to the union.Disappointment is a mild word to describe how they felt on learning about the concessions that were made before the Friday deal. Apart from the huge divorce bill, the status quo is maintained as per immigration. EU citizens would still be allowed to reside in the UK \u201cwithin the specified date\u201d. This was not part of the pre-referendum campaign promises.The deal would guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the rest of the EU have the right to stay. It also affirms the rights of their children and those of partners in existing \u201cdurable relationships\u201d. While UK courts will preside over enforcing rights over EU citizens in Britain they can still refer unclear cases to the European court of justice for eight years after withdrawal.When May rose from her bed in London on Friday morning, the minus zero temperature that descended on the UK overnight was not on her mind.\u00a0 Making her way to Brussels to rouse the European bureaucrats out of their beds was the priority.\u00a0 It was not her first visit, but on this occasion, she knows that her Premiership and the future of her country were at stake.Through the night, May had been in meetings with her \u201cConfidence and Supply\u201d partners \u2013 Democratic Union Party (DUP) \u2013 to sort out the wordings of the \u201cagreement\u201d she presented to Brussels. She could not afford to miss it this time around. The DUP has kept May in Downing Street so far by aligning with her minority government.May\u2019s heart would definitely have been in her mouth as the aircraft taxied to a halt in the pre-dawn dash to Brussels. Wondering if the visit would be a flop as that of Monday, May would be more terrified by the unpredictability of the EU negotiators. They are like hawks and there is tendency they would overlook the fact that she had bent backwards to honour the demands of her DUP partners. May also knew she leads a very hard to please political class, a very demanding opposition and the highly sceptical public.By May\u2019s demeanour, you cannot call her a pushover. Not by any standard. Her utterances and pronouncements while serving as the Home Office Secretary are legendary.\u00a0 She was notorious for talking tough on immigration and police budget cuts in the two-terms of David Cameron\u2019s administration.\u00a0 Unfortunately, since becoming the Prime Minister there have been less of these tough talks.The task of negotiating a good deal for the UK seems very tasking than her stay at the Home Office. Every time there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel for her and the negotiating team,\u00a0 a spanner is thrown at the wheel. The confidence May exuded last week Monday when she boarded the plane to Brussel was efficacious than her trip on Friday. She was a little uncertain in her steps.May and her team realised how much this deal meant to the progress of the BREXIT negotiations, but they failed to sample the opinion of the \u201ckingmakers\u201d in Belfast before the Monday meeting. This mistake, which eventually put May in a very difficult situation, prompted the second visit to Brussels on Friday.When May arrived at the press conference on Friday, you could, by her body language, conclude that her sacrifice and all-night negotiations with the \u201ckingmakers\u201d had paid off. The main contention for stalling the negotiations on Monday, among others, had been the Irish border issue.\u00a0 The DUP leaders wanted an assurance that Northern Ireland would get the same treatment as the rest of the country. And in getting this, there won\u2019t be a hard border between Ireland and Great Britain.This is a very understandable request from the Irish front because a hard BREXIT would have driven a wedge between the two Irelands in terms of a physical border. This would have negated the terms of the popular Good Friday/Belfast peace agreement in 1999. This was a momentous agreement in terms of relationships between the Irish and the UK government.The Irish border issue has become contentious as the BREXIT negotiations progressed. There were fears of the return to the days when there were physical borders and immigration controls. While the deal has now somewhat put to rest the border issue, it has also highlighted the weakening of the terms of Britain\u2019s exit.Reacting to May and Juncker\u2019s announcement, Foster, the DUP leader said she was happy her party was able to make six substantial changes to the earlier deal that was presented on Monday.\u00a0 She said: \u201cThere is no red line down the Irish sea and clear confirmation that the entirety of the UK is leaving the European Union, leaving the single market and leaving the customs union.\u201dThese events have once again reiterated the fact that the BREXIT vote was a gargantuan mistake on the part of UK. Watching Michael Gove, UK\u2019s Environment Secretary and one of the leading Leave supporters praising the deal was very uncomfortable. Justifying the divorce bill, he said, it would allow Britain to invest more in the NHS. I just could not get his point. So is Nigel Farage.This same Gove that one year ago said UK was paying too much into EU. Politicians will always be politicians, standing on the side of populism, no matter how wrong it may be. The losers are the voters who still have the Polish decorators to \u201ccontend\u201d with as neighbours and colleagues for quite some time. And to think this is the basis of BREXIT in the first place is mind-boggling.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

Forty-five members of the UK parliament said Commonwealth countries may get fast-tracked visas to the UK after Brexit if the proposal sails through. UK Telegraph reports that the suggestion was made in a letter addressed to the home secretary, Amber Rudd. According to the letter, Commonwealth stood with Britain when it witnessed \u201cexistential threats\u201d, but that UK has left its allies in the cold as it \u201cpivoted to Europe.\u201d The letter read, \u201cI am writing to urge you to extend the hand of friendship to our Commonwealth partners.\u201cIn the previous century, Commonwealth countries stood with Britain as we faced existential threats from abroad but as we pivoted to Europe, increasingly, our Commonwealth allies were left in the cold. \u201cThe lack of consideration for Commonwealth citizens is at its starkest at our border. While EU citizens are collecting their luggage or exchanging greetings with loved ones, our Commonwealth friends wait tirelessly in the \u2018All other passports\u2019 queue. \u201cFirstly, signs at border control that class every non-EU national as \u2018All other passports\u2019 should be changed to \u2018The Commonwealth and all other passports\u2019. This is a small step but one that can be enacted quickly. \u201cSecondly, the government must commit to examine ways to reduce wait times for Commonwealth citizens entering the UK, perhaps through the use of dedicated Commonwealth border control gates. \u201cEntry processing may not be as quick as in the EU channel as several of the 52 Commonwealth nations require a visa for travel to the UK however, this would send out an important message about the value Britain places on its relationship with the Commonwealth.\u201d Another suggestion made was that Commonwealth citizens be allowed access to the registered traveller scheme, which would allow them access to use UK/EU lanes and reduce time spent waiting in line. They added, \u201cFinally, access to the Registered Traveller Scheme should be further expanded to include additional Commonwealth countries. This programmee, predominately aimed at the business traveler, allows some foreign nationals who meet specific requirements to register and use the UK/EU lanes and e-passport gates, dramatically reducing the time spent waiting in line.\u201cHome secretary, you are in a position to effect real, positive change in our relations with our Commonwealth partners.

So, these are some of the implications,\u201d he said.Akinterinwa added that Brexit could also affect Nigeria\u2019s and ECOWAS\u2019 relationship with the EU.According to him, since Britain is not part of the Schengen Visa Regime, anyone going to Britain must apply for visa directly for Britain.\u201cSince the purpose for withdrawing from the EU is to emphasise British sovereignty, the British will now be in a better position to deal with international migrants in its context.\u201cThere are three million migrants in the UK, while we talk about 1.2 million Britons living in the other parts of Europe.\u201cIn this case, the issue of migration becomes an important matter on the strategic calculations of the government.\u201cIt means that the immigrants are likely to cut a rough deal; they are not likely to be given the type of accommodation they currently have.\u201cThe UK border will now be in a better position to control the inflow and outflow of tourists to the UK,\u201d he explained.Akinterinwa, however, said that with the Brexit already hurting the Pound Sterling and the Euro, it was positive for Nigeria.\u201cWith the Brexit, the Pound Sterling has fallen as against the U.S. Dollar; the Euro too has also fallen.\u201cInvestors, immediately, for fear of the unknown began to move their investments thinking of relocation and that immediately affected the value of the Pound and it began to fall.\u201cSo, the parity of the naira to the Pound Sterling, if the Pound Sterling is falling, is good for Nigeria; it is a welcome development at that level,\u201d he said.NANNigeria will no longer be a by-word for corruption \u2013 BuhariMiyetti Allah now ruling Nigeria for asking Saraki to resign \u2013 Benue govtWhy Nigeria must be restructured \u2013 Edwin ClarkNFF crisis: Pinnick reacts as Nigeria escapes FIFA banAgabus Pwanagba: Nigeria, a nation in dire need of political ideologyEld-el-Kabir: Abia Muslim community urges FG to end poverty in NigeriaCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "UK eases visa rules", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb News \u00bb UK eases visa rulesPublishedonByThe UK government said doctors and nurses working in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) would be excluded from an annual cap on skilled workers from outside the European Union.Prime Minister Theresa May introduced the cap in 2010 when she was interior minister but has faced growing demands from the healthcare sector to review it due to a shortage of staff that has left hundreds of NHS posts unfilled.The annual limit of 20,700 on all non-EU skilled workers, broken down into monthly quotas, has been breached every month since December.May had promised to end EU freedom of movement after Brexit, but she has yet to publish her plans for a new immigration system.She wants migration controlled but says Britain should also attract the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d from around the world.The government has announced a new \u201cstart-up\u201d visa for technology entrepreneurs, which will replace a visa route that was previously only open to graduates.Migration Watch, a pressure group demanding tighter controls, reacted with disappointment to the government\u2019s changes on doctors\u2019 visas.\u201cIt may be necessary, at least temporarily, to cope with the prospect of Brexit, but in the longer term the answer has to be to train our own medics and not take them from countries that need them far more than we do,\u201d chairman Andrew Green told the Daily Telegraph.UK ex-minister speaks on conflict in Nigeria\u2019s governmentUS gives update on suspended visa services in AbujaNASS siege: What UK, US, EU others should do to sponsors of invasion \u2013 Timi FrankUK reacts to National Assembly invasionCAC pastor who dupes members for visa, immigration jobs arrestedAnti-graft war: UK govt paying lip-service to Nigeria\u2019s effort \u2013 Senator UtaziCopyright \u00a9 Daily Post - Nigeria News"}{"head": "Brexit: Thousands storm London to protest, says \u201cour future uncertain\u201d", "classes": [], "content": "Home \u00bb News \u00bb Brexit: Thousands storm London to protest, says \u201cour future uncertain\u201dPublishedonByThousands of demonstrators gathered in central London on Saturday to march in protest against last week\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, a result that has plunged Britain into political chaos and which most people in the capital rejected.Most protestors were young adults, and many were draped in EU flags while others waved banners proclaiming slogans like \u201cI\u2019m with EU\u201d or simply \u201cWrexit.\u201dThey chanted \u201cwhat do we want to do?

On that day, the referendum on the UK\u2019s European Union (EU) membership was held. The result shows that 52% of British voted to leave the EU and 48% voted to remain in the EU. The breakdown of the result across the UK shows that England and Wales voted strongly for Brexit \u2013 the word that represents leaving the EU \u2013 while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted for Bremain \u2013 the word that represents staying in the EU. The dust raised by the outcome of the referendum has not yet settled \u2013 the fallout panic from Brexit is still evident, with volatility in the global financial markets staring us in the face. The Economist Intelligence Unit has hinted that panic would continue as uncertainty that Brexit brings persists. Across the world the implications of Brexit have become topical and its ramifications cut across fields of study. Pundits around the world have expressed opinions with trumpeting calls to explore possible interventions in order to address the fallout panic from Brexit. This article examines what Brexit means for Africa, and argues that Africa stands to gain if African countries focus on the economic dimension of Africa\u2019s regional integration. This will enable Africa negotiate better trade relations with the UK and the EU.Following the UK\u2019s EU referendum, opinions are divided among pundits on what Brexit means for Africa. Clearly, Brexit brings uncertainties to the global markets, as evidence has shown from post-Brexit financial losses. Africa is integrated into the global markets through the commodity markets of African countries. Also, to a large extent, Africa is integrated into the global financial markets through the listing of many African companies in the global stock markets. Prima facie, the uncertainties rising from Brexit appears to have zero immediate effect on African markets. This is because the referendum was not premised on issues facing African economies. The referendum was rather underpinned largely by political sentiments within the EU, though there are economic sentiments.However, the impact of Brexit on Africa will depend on when the toll of Brexit on European market begins to kick European countries \u2013 which the majority of African countries have trade relations with \u2013 in the teeth. It is until then that Africa will begin to feel the pains of Brexit. As Africa and Europe are major trading partners \u2013 which explains why the effect of Brexit on the EU will have spill-over effects on Africa \u2013 the expectation is that Brexit will continue to contribute to increased uncertainty in the global (financial) markets and the risks associated with the global (financial) markets, thereby contributing to the risks that Africa will face in the coming years.For decades now, the EU has had significant impact on the UK\u2019s foreign policy in Africa. In terms of trade, aid and diplomacy, the UK has remained the most attracted and committed EU member state in Africa. The UK has shared with the EU its (UK) policy-making processes and strategies in Africa and also has sought the EU\u2019s support in implementing its own (UK) foreign policies in Africa. This reveals the influence that both parties have on policies in Africa, which experts have argued should not be divided, but rather jointly sustained for Africa\u2019s economic progress.What then does Brexit mean for Africa? Brexit will open opportunities for Africa negotiate better trade policies and business relations with the UK \u2013 all which have been obstructed over the years by the EU\u2019s trade policies, for example, the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). To put into context, the EU\u2019s CAP as it currently operates subsidizes European agricultural products, meaning that African farmers are at disadvantage and cannot compete at the European market. With Brexit, trade negotiations will be on the table \u2013 which apparently will by-pass the EU\u2019s trade policies that have not only been detrimental to African farmers but have historically distorted access for African farmers into the European market.Moreover, Brexit means that the UK will be in direct competition with the EU on many trade policies, including CAP. History has shown that the UK has been pressuring the EU to reform its (EU) trade policies towards Africa, particularly the subsidies to European farmers. Thus, Brexit will offer the UK the opportunity to consolidate its trade relations with African countries, particularly the Commonwealth countries, as opposed to the EU having the exclusive authority to negotiate and decide international trade agreements. This will apparently put the UK in the position to trade freely with Africa \u2013 and African countries will be placed on a pedestal to bargain for better deals with both the UK and the EU.Furthermore, Brexit means that the UK will lose significant trade influences in the EU. Given the uncertainties that Brexit brings to the global financial markets, there is likelihood that the UK may lose some existing trade negotiations with African countries. Before Brexit, there were discussions about merging the Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres (BRVM) \u2013 which is the bourse for eight African countries that form the West African CFA franc monetary zone \u2013 with the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Today, there are many African companies listed on the LSE, as London is seen as the hub of European stock exchange. In the face of post-Brexit shocks and uncertainties, African countries may consider exploring (for those that don\u2019t have) or consolidating (for those that already have) bilateral trade relations with European countries like Germany and France. This will mean that Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which currently ranks among the top ten stock exchanges in the world, may become the new hub of European stock exchange; hence desirable for African companies.\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that African countries need to focus on the opportunities that Brexit presents, rather than jumping on the bandwagon of panic wave. Clearly, regional integration in Africa is still at the infant stage. Brexit has presented African countries with the opportunity to integrate the continent economically and politically. But focus should be on the economic dimension of Africa\u2019s regional integration. Though, Africa is integrated into the global market through the commodity market; however, Africa is still at the bottom end, where it is not optimally utilizing its commodities. Therefore, Africa needs to scale up manufacturing productivity in order to tackle the challenges of job and wealth creation.

A positive trade balance between ourselves and other countries brings in much-needed foreign currency and employment opportunities; a negative trade balance, on the other hand - where we buy more from them than they buy from us - means the opposite.South Africa exports goods valued at R84 billion to Germany, for example, but buys imports of R127bn. This constitutes a healthy trade balance in Germany\u2019s favour. This needs strenuous efforts to create a better balance.The trade relationship with the UK operates in South Africa\u2019s favour. We sell R46bn in goods to the UK, while buying R33bn.One of Brexiteers\u2019 chief arguments for leaving the EU is that it will create new and exciting opportunities for trade over the world. Britain\u2019s Secretary of State for International Trade Dr Liam Fox stated in The Telegraph on June 19 that it was his country\u2019s ambition to become the world\u2019s leading champion of free trade, taking the opportunity provided by its exit from the EU to develop an explicitly pro-trade independent policy framework.He visited Uganda, Ethiopia, Mozambique and South Africa last year, presenting the UK\u2019s trade policy for Africa and stressing his country\u2019s eagerness to open new markets and to develop existing trade relations.Fox said South Africa was a key trading partner to the UK, a long-standing, strong and strategic ally for the UK in Africa and internationally.\u201cAs we become an even more outward-looking country, we will continue building on our relationship with South Africa.\u201dUK exports to South Africa increased by 25% in the past decade and South Africa\u2019s exports to the UK increased by more than 5% annually for the past decade, underlining the importance to both of each other\u2019s markets. South Africa is the third biggest trading partner for the UK in the Commonwealth.Fox\u2019s African tour followed a visit to London by Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies, in January last year.Observers were gratified to note that the meetings were a continuation of the ongoing high-level engagement between the UK and South Africa to discuss trade and economic relations and the strengthening of ties while working together to identify trade and investment opportunities for both countries as well as the wider southern Africa and Africa region as the UK prepared to leave the EU.On January 25 last year, the Citizen reported Davies as saying: \u201cAs we work to achieve this, South Africa looks forward to discussing how our trade post-Brexit could build on the recently concluded Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU.\u201dDavies was right to underline the EU dimension; after all, the EU is a huge and extremely significant trading partner of this country.But so are the UK and the EU each other\u2019s biggest trading partners and that will continue even after Brexit. There can be no either/or, or even us/or them approach; we all need each other.South Africa (but also the EU and the UK) will need to follow nuanced and sophisticated policies. From our point of view, we should aim first at increasing trade with the EU, closing the trade gap as far as this is possible while recognising that the EU clearly benefits more from trade with South Africa than does South Africa in trading with the EU.At the same time, while trying to preserve our favourable trade balance with the UK, we must take advantage of the Commonwealth ties with the UK to expand trade with that country and make the most of the new opportunities that will arise. There could well be opportunities for taking up some of the slack in post-Brexit trade between the UK and some EU countries.All of this will demand flexibility and fleetness of foot by our Department of Trade and Industry, as well as our diplomats in the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. The departments and ministers Davies and Lindiwe Sisulu will have to co-operate closely with each other, recognising that the Brexit opportunity, with possible radical alterations to the world trade order, comes along only once in a lifetime.If we are to attract vastly increased foreign investments and sell our goods to the world, we must look as though we know what we are doing.Cut out the populist ideology; focus on trade, business and investment. We must be ready to show the available investment opportunities to potential investors and we must produce the goods that we want to sell. We are going to have to become much smarter at business and investment and manufacture than we have been.

However, having examined the Chequers agreement ... I have come to the conclusion that it does not respect the referendum result \u2013 it is not what people voted for,\" he said.Some in the pro-EU faction have also rejected the plan. Former minister Justine Greening called on Monday for a second referendum to end the stalemate in parliament over the best future relationship with the bloc.May's spokesman said there would be no second referendum under any circumstances, and restated her position that the Chequers plan was the only way to deliver a Brexit that worked in the best interest of the country.Another pro-EU lawmaker Dominic Grieve, who has led previous efforts to get the government to soften its Brexit stance, said the party needed to accept compromises \"or accept that Brexit cannot be implemented and think again about what we are doing\".'MY BREXIT OR NO BREXIT'On Sunday, May attempted to face down would-be eurosceptic rebels by warning that if they sink her premiership then they risk squandering the victory of an EU exit that they have dreamed about for decades.A party meeting last week looked to have snuffed out talk of a confidence motion challenging May's leadership, which would require 48 Conservative members of parliament to initiate, and 159 to win.But, fuelled by criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and anger among grassroots party members, the sentiment against May has gained fresh momentum.A ministerial aide became the ninth party member to resign their post in protest over the Chequers deal. Lawmaker Scott Mann quit on Monday, saying the plan would put him in conflict with his constituents by delivering a \"watered down\" Brexit.The debate is expected to start at 1630 GMT, later than originally planned, with the first votes due around 2000 GMT.The amendments to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill have been proposed by arch-eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg. He said he did not expect the bill, or another bill on trade due to be debated on Tuesday, to be blocked outright by the 650-member parliament.\"I'm sure Theresa May does not want to split the Conservative Party and therefore she will find that the inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it (the Brexit policy) to keep the party united,\" Rees-Mogg said. \"We'll have an idea of the numbers, I suppose, at 10 o'clock on Monday evening.\"\u00a0National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "May on the rocks as foreign, Brexit ministers quit", "classes": [], "content": "British Prime Minister Theresa May's government imploded on Monday as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson followed Brexit minister David Davis in resigning over her masterplan for Britain's future outside the EU.Davis and his deputy dramatically quit overnight over May's plan to retain strong economic ties with the European Union even after Britain leaves in March next year.Brexit cheerleader Johnson then delivered a stunning second blow when he also marched out, triggering speculation that May could face an imminent leadership contest.May's Brexit plan -- agreed by the cabinet on Friday in the hope of unblocking negotiations with Brussels due to resume on Monday -- has now cost her two of her top four ministers, throwing her administration and authority into turmoil.\"This afternoon, the prime minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary,\" her Downing Street office said in a three-sentence statement.\"His replacement will be announced shortly. The prime minister thanks Boris for his work.\"Johnson criticised the Brexit blueprint in private but has so far refrained from public comment.Downing Street swiftly appointed eurosceptic housing minister Dominic Raab to Davis's job, and said May was looking forward to working with him to deliver Britain's departure from the EU in March.The resignation of Davis, with a stinging warning that Britain was \"giving too much away too easily\" in Brexit talks, was a blow to May just days after she declared a truce among her warring ministers.- Next move -All eyes are now on the next move by Brexit hardliners in her centre-right Conservative Party.But the appointment of Raab, a leading Brexit supporter, suggests Tory Brexiteers are divided.Davis himself said it would be \"wrong\" if his departure led to a full-fledged rebellion, insisting that \"of course\" May would survive.May will address parliament later to explain her proposal for Britain to adopt EU rules on goods after Brexit, and is also expected to speak to Conservative MPs.The plan was agreed by cabinet ministers during marathon talks on Friday, where even those wanting a clean break from the EU fell into line.The deal meant that for the first time since the vote for Brexit in June 2016, Britain has a detailed proposal to take to Brussels, and still hopes to agree a deal by October.May's spokesman told reporters: \"There was an agreement reached on Friday and we look forward to taking that agreement forward in negotiations.\"He added: \"We believe it will deliver a positive Brexit, that's what we're focused on.\"European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the change of ministers was not a problem and that the EU was ready to negotiate \"24/7\".The EU \"will continue to negotiate in goodwill, bona fide, with Prime Minister May and the UK negotiators in order to reach a deal\", he said.May spoke to Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, EU president Donald Tusk and the leaders of Ireland, Sweden and Malta over the weekend to discuss her plans, and is meeting Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in London later Monday.\u00a0- 'Reluctant conscript' -In his resignation letter to May late Sunday, Davis warned that on Brexit, \"the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one\".Her plan would \"make the supposed control by parliament illusory rather than real\", and proposals for a \"common rulebook\" on goods \"hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU\".Davis said his job required \"an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript\".Speaking to BBC radio on Monday, he said he hoped Britain would \"resist very strongly any attempt to get any further concessions\".May replied in a letter rejecting \"your characterisation of the policy we agreed\", which she said would see powers currently held by the EU returned to Britain.Davis was appointed after the referendum to head up the newly created Department for Exiting the EU and became the public face of Brexit, leading the British delegation in talks with Brussels.His role had been increasingly overshadowed in recent months as May and her aides took a bigger role, and had reportedly threatened to quit several times as they moved towards closer ties with the EU post-Brexit.Brexit hardliners have welcomed Davis's move, with Conservative MP Peter Bone saying: \"The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.\"The main opposition Labour Party said the government was in \"absolute chaos\".\"It is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy,\" spokesman Keir Starmer said.National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "May faces a new Brexit battle in parliament", "classes": [], "content": "London - British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a battle in parliament on Tuesday, with pro-EU lawmakers hoping to influence her plans to leave the European Union a day after she bowed to demands from Brexit campaigners.May's vulnerability in parliament, where she lost her Conservative Party's majority in an ill-judged election last year, was laid bare on Monday, when her decision to accept demands of pro-Brexit lawmakers stirred a rebellion among those who want to keep the closest possible ties in the EU.On two of Monday's votes her majority was cut to three, suggesting that the leader will struggle to get Brexit legislation through a deeply divided parliament, which could possibly threaten the approval of any Brexit deal with the EU.Tuesday's vote will also test her authority, with a source in the opposition Labour Party saying it would support an attempt to change the wording of her trade bill, voting alongside Conservative rebels to try to defeat the government.May has vowed to stick to her plan to negotiate the closest possible trade ties with the EU, saying her strategy is the only one that can meet the government's aims for Brexit, the biggest shift in Britain's foreign and trade policy for decades.May's spokesman said the leader would stand by her promise to leave such a customs union. The pro-EU Conservative lawmakers want to change the trade bill to force the negotiation of a customs union if attempts to agree a friction-free trade deal with the EU fail.\"When MPs (members of parliament) bring forward amendments, we obviously look at those,\" he told reporters.\"The PM has set out on a number of occasions our position in relation to the customs union, which is that we will be leaving the customs union and she believes that that's what the British people voted for and it is important that we are free to strike independent trade deals around the world.\"But her plan so far has pleased very few, deepening those divisions in her Conservative Party that have so far hampered progress in talks with the EU, and triggering a bitter war of words between its Brexit-supporting and pro-EU factions.\"We can't please everybody. We have to have a compromise position that enables the country to get an agreement with the European Union,\" trade minister Liam Fox told BBC radio.\"It's up now to the EU 27 to determine what sort of relationship they have with us.\"Tuesday's vote will be on the trade bill, which is focused on converting trade deals between the EU and third countries into bilateral deals with Britain. It is a technical bill and was not originally intended to define new trade policy.Pro-EU lawmakers have tabled a change to the wording of the bill to try to force the government to pursue a customs union with the EU if ministers fail to reach an agreement which establishes \"a frictionless free trade area for goods\".Parliament could also consider a government attempt to bring forward its summer break to Thursday from next week, which the government says is logical because there is very little parliamentary business in the remaining days.Any vote on moving the break would take place on Wednesday. Critics say the move is a bid by a government to escape the prospect of more rebellions in the Conservative Party.\"It's nothing more than a shameless attempt to evade scrutiny by a government in absolute disarray,\" said opposition lawmaker Matthew Pennycook, a member of the Labour Party's Brexit policy team. \"There is absolutely no way that I'm voting for it.\"\u00a0National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."}{"head": "Outrage after Trump crushes May's Brexit strategy", "classes": [], "content": "London, United Kingdom - US President Donald Trump launched an extraordinary attack on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy, plunging the transatlantic \"special relationship\" to a new low as they prepared to meet Friday on the second day of his tumultuous trip to Britain.In an interview conducted before he began his visit, which will draw large protests, Trump said May's plans for close future ties with the EU would \"probably kill\" her hopes for a trade deal with the United States.He told The Sun tabloid it was not what Britons backed when they voted in a June 2016 referendum to quit the European Union, and also said former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who resigned this week over the Brexit plan, would make \"a great prime minister\".Junior British foreign minister Alan Duncan sought to brush off the remarks, telling BBC radio: \"Donald Trump is a controversialist, that's his style... I don't think we see it as rude.\"But the comments drew outrage from some British lawmakers and will make for an awkward atmosphere with May when the pair meet at her country retreat of Chequers for a working lunch, followed by a press conference.They also undermine the prime minister as she faces speculation of a leadership challenge from eurosceptics in her Conservative party following the resignations of Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis.Trump, a long-time supporter for Brexit, said he had advised May to leave the EU in a different way but was ignored.\"I would have done it much differently. I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn't agree, she didn't listen to me,\" he told The Sun.\"She wanted to go a different route. I would actually say that she probably went the opposite way. And that is fine. She should negotiate the best way she knows how. But it is too bad what is going on.\"Referring to the Brexit blueprint published by the government on Thursday, which calls for close trading links with the EU after Brexit, Trump said: \"The deal she is striking is a much different deal than the one the people voted on.\"It was not the deal that was in the referendum. I have just been hearing this over the last three days. I know they have had a lot of resignations. So a lot of people don't like it.\"Duncan suggested the president had not seen the detail of the plan when he gave the interview on Wednesday, while also stressing that the much-vaunted special relationship was about much more than Brexit.But Anthony Gardner, who was former president Barack Obama's ambassador to the EU, held nothing back in attacking Trump's attack on May as \"totally unacceptable\" and \"unprecedented\" in the middle of a high-profile visit.\"He is out of control and an embarrassment. He is (a) one-man wrecking machine,\" Gardner tweeted.Trump flew into Britain on Thursday, having already subjected NATO allies in Brussels to a roasting over their levels of defence spending.- 'Kill the deal' -May has insisted that her Brexit plan will allow Britain to strike its own lucrative trade deals with countries like the US after leaving the EU in March next year.She pressed Trump about the deal on Thursday at a gala dinner at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill.Brexit \"creates an opportunity to reach a free trade agreement that creates jobs and growth here in the UK and right across the United States\", she said.But Trump poured cold water on May's offer.\"If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,\" he said.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters Trump was \"thankful for the wonderful welcome\" he received in Britain.\u00a0\"The president likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with The Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her',\" she said.- Tea with the queen -Trump and May are due to watch a display of military special forces on Friday before their formal talks which will cover Russia, ahead of a summit in Finland on Monday between Trump and President Vladimir Putin.Putin's government is accused by May's of unleashing a deadly nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury. Moscow denies the charge, but May is pressing Trump to raise the issue with Putin.\u00a0Trump will later Friday take tea with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, before spending the weekend in Scotland on a private visit that will likely take in 18 holes at one of the property magnate's golf courses, where more protesters await him.He will not attend any high-profile events in London but a mass protest is planned in the capital on Friday, where demonstrators will fly a giant balloon next to the British parliament depicting Trump as a nappy-clad baby.The balloon was authorised by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has crossed swords with Trump several times after the president posted factually incorrect messages over a series of terror attacks in Britain in 2017.In his Sun interview, Trump said Khan had done \"a very bad job on terrorism\", which he linked to migration.

(Getty Images)If the media reports in the UK and American press are anything to go by, before 2014, few outside the UK private sector knew the name Arron Banks \u2014 until he and his chums came to be known as the Brexiteers [Bad Boys of Brexit]\u00a0\u2014 of some interest to the US probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the November 2016 US presidential election.Now he is reported by the BBC to be one of the subjects of inquiries by the British Electoral Commission, the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and a UK parliamentary select committee, investigating allegations of Russian interference, fake news, spending irregularities and misuse of private data in the Brexit campaign.Born in 1966, the British businessman started his journey into notoriety when he donated in October 2014, \u00a31-million to the UK Independent Party (Ukip), a Eurosceptic, right-wing and anti-immigrant political party. The Bristol Post reported that Banks was previously a Conservative party donor, but announced he was\u00a0defecting to Ukip in 2014.\nWhen former Tory leader William Hague claimed he\u2019d never heard of Banks, he announced he was increasing his donation to \u00a31-million.The donation to the group, which had been dismissed by Tories as backward racists, or as former Prime Minister\u00a0David Cameron put it: \u201cswivel-eyed loons\u201d\u00a0who could barely win a seat in Parliament, allowed Ukip to not fizzle out and begin a more targeted Brexit campaign. The chubby, moneyed, G&T aficionado has been described by British media as the \u201cleading figure\u201d in various anti-EU campaigns, including Grassroots Out and\u00a0Leave.EU, as well as the official Vote Leave campaign.Banks\u2019 close relationship with then Ukip leader Nigel Farage quickly made him a key figure in Ukip and the Guardian reported that he was part of the group that president-elect Donald Trump hosted at Trump Tower shortly after his election victory in 2016.The father of five, with a reported net worth of\u00a0\u00a3250-million (as of November 2017) was born in Northwich, Cheshire. The New Statesman said he was raised primarily by his mother as his father ran farms in various African countries. He was expelled from two different schools for \u201can accumulation of offences\u201d, including the sale of lead, stolen from school buildings and other unspecified \u201chigh-spirited bad behaviour\u201d.The Spectator said his second wife Katya \u2014 a former gymnast and model whom he married in 2001 \u2014 was born in Russia. Like Trump, Banks is a Twitter \u201csuper-user\u201d, who often goads anti-Leave campaigners and journalists into twars.It all started with his own disclosure: There has been pointed speculation about Banks\u2019s relationship with Russian officials in the UK since he disclosed in his memoir The Bad Boys of Brexit, that he and his Brexit buddy Andy Wigmore \u2014 a former diplomat and businessman \u2014 had a \u201csix-hour boozy lunch\u201d with the Russian ambassador in November 2015. But Banks has now been forced to admit the contacts were more extensive than previously stated.Emails leaked to UK newspapers The Observer and the Sunday Times revealed Banks had far deeper contacts with Russian officials than he initially claimed, they said. The emails \u2014 Banks alleges \u2014 were stolen. Journalists say they obtained them from a whistleblower.The Guardian said the correspondence shows he met the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, three times, rather than once, and that he shared at least one phone number for the Trump transition team with the Russians, and that he was offered a spot in a gold-mining deal in Russia, although it is not clear whether took up the offer. He said he didn\u2019t.Banks and Wigmore also met ambassador Yakovenko that November, when the gold deal was mentioned, and again a year later, three days after visiting Trump Tower. The disclosures also raise questions as to whether he passed on any sensitive political information in those three meetings. He said he did not.The emails from Banks and key associates were collected by journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit, a diary/memoir of the period leading up to the EU referendum. Oakeshott, described by the Daily Beast as a\u00a0pro-Brexit journalist is alleged to have\u00a0held back evidence of links between Russia and the Brexit campaign while playing down so-called conspiracy theories in televised interviews.Oakeshott collected the emails as part of background research at the time.Instead of alerting authorities to what as contained in the emails, Oakeshott kept them under wraps, saying she only realised their significance as she continued working with Banks and planned to publish them at a later date as part of a separate book she had been working on. Oakeshott claims some of her emails were hacked, but this has been denied by others who had obtained them. Where did Banks get the money to become a political donor? openDemocracy said that in January 2015, one estimate of his wealth was \u00a3100-million. In November 2017 an estimate of \u00a3250-million started making the rounds. Banks reportedly began his career when he was offered a junior job at Lloyd\u2019s of London, a British retail and commercial bank with branches across England and Wales despite having never received a formal tertiary education.openDemocracy said that Banks also owns Eldon Insurance, whose CEO Elizabeth Bilney was in charge at Leave.EU, and where Andy Wigmore is also a director. The company\u2019s profits leapt to \u00a316.7-million for the first half of 2017, which Banks attributes to the business having been transformed by the same artificial intelligence technology used in the Brexit campaign. Banks has stated that he has a controlling interest in a diamond mine in Kimberley, South Africa, and a licence to mine in Lesotho.openDemocracy \u2014 an independent global media platform \u2014 concluded extensive research into Banks\u2019s financial affairs, saying, \u201cthe value of his businesses are materially lower than Banks\u2019 own inflated boasts\u201d. It also questions how he could afford large contributions to the Leave campaign.Banks\u2019 convoluted financial arrangements are partly propped up by companies located in various tax havens, including Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man \u2014 where with\u00a0British businessman Jim Mellon, he owns a bank. In the UK, Companies House records appear to show that Banks has set up 37 different companies using slight variations of his own name. All this makes it hard to ascertain the origins of the money he used to \u201cbuy\u201d the Brexit campaign.Banks frequently asserts that he runs\u00a0an insurance business. However, a report by openDemocracy says he has been prohibited by the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority from running his own insurance company after a report from Gibralter\u2019s Financial Services Commission \u201cserious and widespread failings\u201d.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(Getty)A week ago, Britain had strict red lines on Brexit, pro-EU lawmakers were \u201ctraitors\u201d and the plan for Britain\u2019s future ties with the European Union after leaving the bloc were a jumble of platitudes and overweening ambition.Fast-forward a few days and Brexit hardliners are on the defensive, while the government is showing a willingness to compromise and outlining a more pragmatic vision for a country half-in, half-out of the European Union.\u201cThe momentum and the situation call for ruthless realism. Dreaming of a world that had turned out differently is not enough,\u201d former Conservative leader William Hague, an influential voice in the party, wrote in The Daily Telegraph.Prime Minister Theresa May, who campaigned to stay in the European Union in the 2016 referendum, has tried to balance moderates and hardliners in her party ever since coming to power two years ago at a time of political upheaval.She was forced to show humility again after calling an early general election in June last year only to lose her party\u2019s majority after a wooden performance on the campaign trail.A year later, commentators said recent events show she has firmly chosen the moderate side with a plan for Brexit, to be fully detailed on Thursday, that envisages close regulatory alignment with the EU to allow unhindered trade in goods.\u201cMrs May has recognised that the only pragmatic approach to decoupling from the EU is a softer version of Brexit,\u201d the\u00a0Financial Times said in an editorial.The plan has unleashed a rebellion by Brexit hardliners who fear it may prevent Britain from concluding free-trade agreements with third countries and effectively turn the country into a \u201cvassal state\u201d or \u201ccolony\u201d\u00a0 of the EU.It prompted the resignation of Foreign Secretary\u00a0Boris Johnson and Brexit Minister David Davis, as well as several other Conservative party figures, but analysts say that May has been able to face down the rebellion so far.In the pro-Conservative Spectator magazine, Brendan O\u2019Neill wrote that there had been \u201ca Remainer coup\u201d \u2014 a reference to Johnson\u2019s replacement Jeremy Hunt, who also supported staying in the EU but says he has now changed his mind.\u201cBrexit will be softened, which is to say undermined: turned from a passionate cry for democratic independence into a bureaucratic exercise of pursuing slow-motion semi-divergence from the EU while actually kind of staying in,\u201d O\u2019Neill wrote.A lot will depend on how the proposals are received in Brussels but the initial signs have been encouraging.\u201cIf the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,\u201d Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told a session of the Irish parliament.\u201cI think perhaps we are now entering into that space,\u201d he said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at the Western Balkans summit in London on Tuesday, said it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d that there was a British proposal on the table.\u201cWhat we want to do now is to bring the negotiating progress forward,\u201d she said.British ministers have also sounded more conciliatory.Justice Minister David Gauke said on Tuesday that the option of walking away from negotiations advocated by some Brexit hardliners was not \u201cpain-free\u201d and would have \u201ca negative impact on our constituents, on the British public\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s a negotiation.\nThat requires compromise on both sides if we are to reach an agreement,\u201d he told BBC radio.Commentators have also observed a new firmness shown by May in the negotiations and her increasingly overt challenge to the \u201cBrexiteers\u201d to try to take her down.\u201cMay seems to have emerged stronger \u2014 at least in the short term \u2014 from Davis and Johnson\u2019s high profile resignations,\u201d said Constantine Fraser, an analyst at TS Lombard, an economic research consultancy.But Fraser warned of challenges ahead for May, particularly given the loss of parliamentary support from hardliners.\u201cHow on earth will May get that through parliament?\u201d he asked, referring to future votes on any Brexit deal.Steve Peers, a professor at the University of Essex, said he believed the Conservative party had in effect split into two groups.\u201cThe pragmatists recognise that Brexit forces a trade-off between sovereignty and the economy\u2026 The fantasists deny that such a trade-off exists,\u201d he said.\u201cThe cabinet now clearly consists of the pragmatists, with the fantasists on the back benches.

(Stefan Wermuth/Reuters)British Prime Minister Theresa May drew fire from all sides on Monday over her Brexit strategy as a former minister described it as a \u201cfudge\u201d and called for a second EU referendum, and eurosceptics readied a parliamentary challenge.Former education secretary Justine Greening, who opposed Brexit, said May\u2019s plan to follow European Union rules on trade in goods without being able to influence them was \u201cthe worst of both worlds\u201d.Noting the deep divisions in government and parliament on the way forward, Greening said the decision must be put to voters \u2014\u00a0becoming the most senior member of May\u2019s Conservative party to back the idea.\u201cThe only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people,\u201d she wrote in an article in The Times.May has repeatedly ruled out a second referendum, after Britons voted by 52 percent for Brexit in 2016, but Greening\u2019s support for a so-called People\u2019s Vote will give the campaign a huge boost.Her intervention is also another blow for May\u2019s plan for close ties with the EU, which had already come under fire from Conservatives who want a clean break.Two top ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, quit in protest last week followed by a string of junior walkouts, including another on Monday.Eurosceptics will have a chance to show their strength in the House of Commons late Monday by voting on amendments to a bill setting up a new customs regime after Brexit, which would effectively wreck May\u2019s plan.They are not expected to pass, as the opposition Labour party will not support them, but will show how many MPs are prepared to publicly oppose the prime minister.Meanwhile May will also test her plan with the EU this week, with Brexit negotiations due to resume in Brussels on Monday and the other 27 leaders due to hold their first talks on the proposal on Friday.Split the partyThe prime minister this weekend defended her plan, saying there was no alternative that protected trade in goods with the EU and avoided border checks in Ireland.She insisted it would allow Britain to control migration, end the jurisdiction of EU courts and forge its own trade policy \u2014\u00a0despite US President Donald Trump saying it could \u201ckill\u201d a US-UK trade deal.But eurosceptics believe it keeps Britain too close to the EU, and Davis, the former Brexit secretary, warned in the Financial Times on Monday it would deny the government the \u201cfreedom to run our own economy\u201d.\u201cIt would be profoundly dangerous to leave the EU but remain subject to regulations made by institutions in which we have no say,\u201d he wrote.In an article in the Mail on Sunday, May urged eurosceptics to keep their \u201ceyes on the prize\u201d, warning: \u201cIf we don\u2019t, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\u201dPro-Europeans are also unhappy, including with the plan for loose ties with the EU on Britain\u2019s dominant services sector, and former prime minister Tony Blair said it would lead to a \u201cconfused outcome\u201d.Some MPs have tabled an amendment to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, also known as the customs bill, seeking a new customs union with the EU, which May has strongly rejected.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the powerful European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs, warned May\u2019s approach would split her party.He accused the prime minister of never having given up her support for staying in the EU, telling the BBC on Sunday she was \u201ca Remainer who has remained a Remainer\u201d.Rees-Mogg said she still had time to change course, but said the current plan would only go through parliament with the support of opposition votes.\u201cThe inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it to keep the party united,\u201d he told BBC television.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

(AFP)British Prime Minister Theresa May will publish details Thursday of her long-awaited Brexit blueprint to restart talks with the EU, after facing down a revolt by eurosceptic ministers that could still unseat her.In a policy paper, the government will outline proposals for a free trade area and a \u201ccommon rule book\u201d with the EU in goods after pressure from businesses to allow cross-border trade to continue as normal.But Britain would still plan to leave the EU single market and customs union and set its own path on the far bigger services sector, hoping to be able to curb EU immigration and strike its own trade deals with third countries.For the City of London the plan would propose \u201ca looser partnership\u201d with the EU rather than original proposals for \u201cmutual recognition\u201d of British and EU rules after Britain leaves the bloc in March, the Financial Times reported.\u201cWe\u2019re making sure we\u2019ve got a bespoke relationship with the EU,\u201d Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who was only appointed on Monday after his predecessor David Davis quit in protest over the plan, told BBC radio.\u201cIt\u2019s a credible proposal. It\u2019s bold, it\u2019s ambitious but it\u2019s also pragmatic,\u201d he said.The plan has caused outrage among eurosceptic members of May\u2019s Conservative party, and foreign minister Boris Johnson joined Davis in dramatically quitting this week in protest.Their departures, followed by a clutch of junior aides, destabilised May\u2019s government and revived talk of a leadership challenge against her.The prime minister is also likely to face some opposition in Brussels, where officials have repeatedly warned Britain to lower its expectations about how close ties can be.\u201cOf course the EU-27 is open to compromise but not one that can undermine the main pillars of the single market,\u201d an EU official said on condition of anonymity.An EU source said: \u201cWe will look at these things constructively, and in a way that is helpful to the prime minister.\u201dMay has briefed leaders including EU president Donald Tusk and German chancellor Angela Merkel on her plan and reported a positive response, although they are awaiting the detail.Britain does not have long to argue its case \u2014 both sides are aiming for a deal by October, to allow time for its ratification by the British and European parliaments.Failure to agree would see Britain leave the EU without a deal, with the risk of huge economic disruption on both sides of the Channel.The Financial Times has reported that one contingency plan being examined in case of a no-deal Brexit is using barges to help keep the lights on in Northern Ireland in case there is disruption to electricity imports from the Republic of Ireland.Britain voted for Brexit in June 2016, but May has so far been unable to present a common position to Brussels on what she wants because of deep divisions in her government.Amid warnings from businesses that continued uncertainty is risking investment and jobs, and fears time is running out, her cabinet finally agreed on a plan last week.The aim is to keep EU rules on goods to protect complex manufacturing supply chains, using technology to levy its own duties on UK-bound products from outside the bloc, while diverging on services.\n\u201cWe need to rise to the challenge and grasp the opportunities\u201d of Brexit, said Raab, adding that the policy represented a \u201cbalance\u201d.But Johnson, a leading Brexit campaigner, said following EU rules without being able to alter them risked consigning Britain to the \u201cstatus of colony\u201d, and said it looked like a \u201csemi-Brexit\u201d.Other eurosceptics who want a clean break with the bloc are also livid, prompting speculation they may launch a confidence vote against May.Brexit-backing MPs, including leading eurosceptic Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, will also seek to force her hand by submitting amendments to a trade bill being debated in the House of Commons next week.Rees-Mogg told AFP his aim was only \u201cto help the government stick to some of its earlier promises\u201d.Get the M&G in your inbox dailyAll material \u00a9 Mail & Guardian Online.

The government will implement what you decide.\u201dThe message was crystal clear: This was a historic constitutional moment, a renewal of the social compact underpinning Britain\u2019s institutions, a choice of such significance that it had to be taken directly by the electorate. Forty-two years after Britain joined the Common Market, and 55 years after Harold Macmillan\u2019s controversial first application, it was decision time, a plebiscite to end all the dithering. No wonder the vote gripped the nation like no other in living memory.Equally indisputable, according to both Remain and Leave campaigns, was that withdrawing would entail a rupture, a revolutionary break from the status quo. By the end of the campaign, it was clear that Britain was not talking a few tweaks, or a minor renegotiation of its membership. Positions had evolved and hardened.Fast forward two-and-a-bit years, and the anticlimax is extraordinary. Many Leave voters feel that they were duped, that the referendum was little more than a charade, that Britain\u2019s long and proud democratic journey has come to an end. When the Government pledged to follow instructions, what it really meant was that it would deliver on a Remain vote, seeing it as carte blanche for more integration. A Leave vote, on the other hand, was so clearly preposterous and self-defeating that it could never be enacted. The \u201crealists\u201d called Brexit a mirage, impossible because it was incompatible with the existing technocratic legal order \u2014 never realising how inflammatory such statements sounded.Now, many Leave voters are beginning to fear that this promise to implement the referendum was a monumental lie, one of the worst cases of deceit from the political class in modern British history. It was only made on the expectation that it would never be delivered; and we know no preparations were made for a Leave vote, putting Britons on the back foot from day one. Even more grievously, the establishment \u2014 most members of parliament, the Confederation of British Industry, most civil servants, the cultural elites, many academics and so on \u2014 won\u2019t accept the result. They are refighting the referendum using every tool they have, without a vocal and articulate Leave campaign to oppose them.For a little while after the referendum, these pro-Remain refuseniks were in abeyance, and with the right government, the right attitude and the right cadre of advisers they could have been contained (or even co-opted). The technocratic status quo could have been crushed, and a genuine and workable Brexit forged, by leveraging this country\u2019s huge assets and economic strength.But the original Brexiteers imploded within hours of the result, and the Government that did emerge from the madness turned out to exhibit Suez Crisis levels of incompetence. Prime Minister Theresa May adopted a divided governmental structure that simply wasted time and handed power to the civil service.The staggering intellectual and leadership vacuum since 2016 \u2014 and last year\u2019s amateurish general election \u2014 allowed the civil service to seize complete control, and pro-Remain MPs to threaten to overturn any meaningful Brexit. There has been no real no-deal planning, as such an outcome was anathema to those in charge.The Chequers plan, which is bound to be adulterated further by European negotiators, looks like it will make it impossible for the UK to enjoy the upsides of leaving, while retaining most of the downsides of membership. True, there is more than one way to leave, and multiple palatable compromises; May\u2019s now-defunct red lines were too rigid. But some compromises are so great that what is left is no longer a true Brexit. It is now nearly certain that whatever deal she \u201cnegotiates\u201d will fall into this tragic category.The situation is thus exceptionally grave. For Leave voters and at least some Remainers, this is another Iraq \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d moment: A shattering, toxic realisation that their assumptions about their rulers were misplaced. Former prime minister Tony Blair never recovered from going to war on a false prospectus. Trust is central to politics, and its breakdown helps to explain much of the angst and rage of recent years. The financial crisis was a lie of sorts: it broke an implicit promise by the elites that they knew what they were doing. The parliamentary expenses scandal was another.There is a better way. The Government must stop the current, doomed Brexit process, scrap the White Paper and start again from scratch \u2014 this time negotiating properly and threatening the EU with severe consequences if it doesn\u2019t cooperate, just as Brussels has been doing with Britain. The December agreement must be torn up: The UK cannot accept the EU\u2019s interpretation of the Irish question or the ridiculous backstop. Britain will need not just a new hardball negotiating approach, but an entirely new, pro-growth strategy to help the economy and companies get through the turbulence. This may mean halting Article 50, or finding another temporary solution to buy time.If none of this happens, if Brexit is killed off, de jure or de facto, Britain will be plunged into a permanent political crisis. The Tory grass roots and the party\u2019s pro-Brexit base will never forgive the leadership\u2019s betrayal, and Labour will lose its working-class support. A Ukip 2.0 will arise, as well as European-style populist and nationalist parties. Swathes of the country \u2014 perhaps, after the next recession, a majority \u2014 will cry out for a Donald Trump figure.Is that really what May wants her legacy to be? Time has almost run out, but she can still \u2014 just \u2014 pull back from the brink.\u2014 The Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2018Allister Heath is a British journalist and commentator.

Yet in real time, these moments that make or break governments \u2014 such as Sir Robert Peel\u2019s repeal of the corn laws, which split the Tories for a generation \u2014 are more typically the hard-fought climax of processes that follow a circuitous and up-and-down path, with the key decision put off until it is inescapable.The moment of decision for UK Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit is following this pattern too. The route has meandered for nearly two years through negotiations, summits, lawmaking and elections; last week\u2019s English elections will be part of the context too. The climax has been long predicted and frequently postponed. To judge by what Downing Street said this week, as ministers prepared for Wednesday\u2019s cabinet committee on customs arrangements with the EU, it may well be pushed back yet again by a few weeks. Yet the moment is nearing all the same. When it finally arrives it will be bitter and destructive, above all for the Conservative party. But the Brexit terms were always going to have to be faced in some form. That form, it now turns out, will focus on the customs arrangements.Much of the commentary presumes that the outcome remains in serious doubt. Yet it seems increasingly likely that the UK will seek to remain in some form of customs association with the EU. Whether the EU will agree is, however, another matter.May has already grappled with this question twice during the Brexit negotiations. Both times it has come up in the unavoidable context of the Irish border. Both times, in December on the divorce terms with the EU and in March when a transition agreement was made, May signed up to a soft border in Ireland.It is certainly true that the terms of the earlier deals contained significant elements of fudge. It is also true that the UK side still talks about technological solutions that the EU dismisses as fantasy. Nevertheless, unless May now abandons those two earlier agreements and unless the EU takes a much gentler line than it has done, there are only two realistic outcomes for Britain to choose from while avoiding the return of a hard border in Ireland.These outcomes are, first, the UK remaining in some form of continuing customs union with the EU or, second, Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union while Britain leaves it. The latter is opposed by Northern Ireland unionists and May dismissed it as recently as Wednesday when she said at prime minister\u2019s questions that an Irish Sea customs border was something no UK prime minister would agree to. This leaves UK membership of the customs union \u2014 or something on similar lines \u2014 as still much the most likely outcome of the internal British political argument. Why? Because the EU has shown no interest in, and is under little internal pressure to explore, either of the alternative options being debated by British ministers, and the arithmetic in parliament is tending that way too. In the House of Lords, Tory peers have voted with the opposition parties to demand a continuing customs union. Surely there will be divisions. Some Tories will reject any soft Brexit, although no cabinet Brexiteer has said it is a resignation matter. But the issue need not bring May\u2019s government down. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s Euro-sceptic sabre-rattling over the customs issue this week is a bluff she will have to call. In the end and with no small irony, the pivotal issue in Brexit is the same one that in different ways has so haunted British politics for more than two centuries \u2014 justice for Ireland. Today, peace and prosperity in Ireland depend upon a soft Brexit for which there is a parliamentary majority. A hard Brexit, with a hard Irish border, is clueless, delinquent and playing with fire.\u2014 Guardian News & Media LtdMartin Kettle is a Guardian columnist.\u00a0AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedNo-deal Brexit will be a disaster for youthDon\u2019t worry about robots stealing our jobsEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

And what adds to the political drama now enveloping the United Kingdom\u2019s government is that his resignation comes two days after May and her cabinet colleagues reached a tenuous agreement that was supposed to end months of bitter political sniping, backbiting and rivalries to deliver a so-called soft Brexit \u2014 if the EU27 and the European Commission agreed.What is clear now is that before any Brexit deal can be reached \u2014 and that is supposed to be signed off at an October summit, or a special one which can be called in mid-November at the latest \u2014 May\u2019s Conservative party must try and find some degree of unity on what exactly Brexit means.Those on the right of her party favour a so-called \u2018hard Brexit\u2019, one that would see the UK leave without any deal with the EU after more than four decades of integration at almost every level. That\u2019s a scenario industry leaders warn puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, but supporters say will allow the UK to reach trade deals as and when it likes.For moderate Conservatives, the \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 is preferable, one that keeps many of the ties in place, limits the fallout on the economy, keeps the UK in a common customs area for the free movement of trade, services and goods, but has controls on the free movement of people.At Chequers, the PM\u2019s country retreat, on Friday, May managed to convince her cabinet to back a softer Brexit, a stand that might win approval from the EU who are reluctant to water down any of the four freedoms of trade, services, goods and people, lest others in the EU27 want similar deals in the future, weakening the foundation of the economic, political and social union.Davis\u2019 resignation risks splitting her Conservative party and triggering a vote on her leadership. Under Conservative party rules, 48 Members of Parliament can trigger one by sending letters to its 1922 Committee, and estimates are that about 40 have already done so, some have sent them following her disastrous general election campaign that sees her now relying on 10 MPs from Northern Ireland to govern. What is clear now, however, is that the United Kingdom\u2019s government is more disunited than ever.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedTories better off with May, poll suggestsEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The bill is now a very different piece of legislation to the one launched in the Commons by Brexit Secretary David Davis last September. It was significantly amended in the Commons just before Christmas. Now the Lords have fundamentally transformed it. Members of parliament must therefore decide what to do with the many changes that the Lords have made. It will be the most important few months of parliamentary activity in a generation, perhaps more.If the government and Labour leadership had had their way, the soft Brexit opportunities that now face MPs this summer would probably not have existed at all, or in very constrained ways. Both parties had their own reasons for wanting the bill to go through. Last week, there were some particularly striking government defeats in the Lords. The first, moved by the bishop of Leeds, would keep the UK as a participant in EU agencies such as Europol. The second, moved by the Duke of Wellington no less, removes the government\u2019s preferred Brexit date \u2014 March 29, 2019 \u2014 from the bill, giving elbow room for a possible agreement to pause or extend the Article 50 withdrawal process.Britain\u2019s MPs will have to vote again, not just on the European Economic Area, but on almost all the pivotal issues that would make the difference between a hard Brexit and a soft one.When the bill went through the Commons last autumn, relatively few of these issues raised large tussles. May\u2019s Brexit strategy is to hold the Tory party together by withdrawing entirely from the EU, while making serious practical compromises to maintain as \u201cfrictionless\u201d a relationship as possible with the EU, its institutions, agencies and member states \u2014 Ireland above all. Government defeats on crucial questions such as the single market, the customs union or the Irish border would overturn the entire strategy. Yet this is becoming more likely now. May\u2019s strategy worked for her first months as prime minister. But the \u201clost election\u201d of 2017 and the fundamental differences among Conservative MPs and ministers over Brexit issues that cannot be permanently postponed mean its lifetime is now almost spent. Labour\u2019s caution on Brexit shows little sign of changing, but there are enormous temptations for Jeremy Corbyn to overcome his anti-EU instincts in order to humiliate the government on at least some of the Lords amendments.This explains why, even as she runs out of road on Brexit, May still acts as if she is hoping that something unexpected will turn up. There is now talk at Westminster of the Brexit bill votes being delayed to the autumn, partly to avoid embarrassing Commons defeats affecting the June EU summit at which the future relationship will be discussed \u2014 and partly because Conservative rebels on both sides of the argument might be more disciplined if the talks appear to be nearing a successful conclusion.It is hard to imagine that the Tory party\u2019s Commons discipline is about to collapse on every single issue that the Lords have put on the table. Nevertheless, the Tory soft Brexiters seem a bit bolder now. That is partly because their numbers are gently creeping up \u2014 and also because, in the end, these moderate Tories feel they have to fight harder now if they are to prevent their party from collapsing even further to the United Kingdom Independence Party right.The \u201cCrazy\u201d jibe last week acts as a recruiting sergeant for the soft Brexiters. The coming weeks and months may be their moment. A hung parliament gives them the means. The slide to the right gives them the motive. And now the Lords have given them their opportunity.

We will take back control of our borders, with an end to free movementIn the two years since the EU referendum, the government I lead has worked ceaselessly towards achieving a Brexit deal that honours the result of that vote and puts the United Kingdom on track for a prosperous future.We have already made considerable progress, with agreement on protecting the rights of EU citizens living here in the UK and British citizens living in the EU, on an implementation period to give businesses time to prepare, and on a fair financial settlement. However, on crucial aspects of our future relationship with the EU our discussions have reached an impasse. Neither of the models that the EU has put on the table would work for Britain.A standard free trade agreement, with Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and single market, would shatter the constitutional integrity of our United Kingdom. Some combination of European Economic Area (EEA) and customs union membership would not deliver on the referendum result. It would mean continued free movement, ongoing annual payments of vast sums, the obligation to enact the entirety of EU law and no ability to strike our own trade deals. Neither of these options is acceptable.A \u201cno deal\u201d scenario is not our intended outcome either. It risks people\u2019s livelihoods and threatens the Union. But as a responsible government, we have to prepare for all eventualities \u2014 and that is precisely what I asked the Cabinet to do at Chequers.Instead, we have an alternative proposal, which the Cabinet agreed the detailed shape of on Friday. Later this week, a White Paper will spell it out in full. It is a coherent package that my party can unite behind, that should command a majority in Parliament and inspire the confidence of the whole British people, however they voted two years ago. I am convinced that this is in the best interests of the UK and the EU.It honours the referendum result. The UK will leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. We will take back control of our borders, with an end to free movement. We will take back control of our money, with no more vast annual sums paid to the EU. We will take back control of our laws, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom.An up-front commitment to maintain a common rule book for goods and agricultural products, underpinned by our determination to maintain high standards in consumer and employment rights and environmental standards, will enable the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods. This common rule book, and a new business-friendly customs model, will ensure both frictionless trade with the EU and the freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. A parliamentary lock on all new rules and regulations will restore sovereignty and democratic accountability, ensuring that the men and women you elect will make the laws we all live by.Crucially, this deal will strengthen the whole United Kingdom. There will be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and no new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Leaving the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy will give us the freedom to design new policies that work for our rural and coastal communities.Building on our shared values, we propose continued close cooperation on security matters to keep our people safe. At the same time, we will have a fully independent foreign and defence policy, working closely with our EU and Nato allies.This proposal is fully in accordance with the principles I set out in my Lancaster House, Florence, Munich and Mansion House speeches. It also honours the commitments made in the last election manifesto upon which every Conservative MP stood. But our proposal of a common rule book to underpin our trading relationship represents a significant evolution of the UK\u2019s negotiating position.I judge this to be necessary in order to move the negotiations forward. The Cabinet agreed with that judgement and this is now the formal collective position of Her Majesty\u2019s Government. On that basis, the UK\u2019s negotiating team will now engage with the EU on it at pace.Now is the time to set aside, once and for all, the divisions of the past and to unite as one nation to achieve agreement with the EU. Achieving a Brexit deal that honours the referendum result and sets us on a prosperous course is my duty and my mission.

Almost half think it would be bad for Britain.The new Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday the prime minister was still trying to persuade members of the cabinet that her strategy was the best way forward.Raab also warned that Britain could refuse to pay a 39 billion pound (Dh187 billion) divorce bill to the EU if it does not get a trade deal - a threat used before by ministers.Speaking to the BBC, Raab refused to deny reports the government is planning to stockpile food or use a section of motorway in England as a lorry park to deal with increased border checks if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.Asked about a story in The Sun newspaper that the government was planning to stockpile processed food, Raab initially replied \"no\" and then added: \"That kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media, to the extent that the public pay attention to it, I think is unhelpful.\" The possibility of leaving without a trade deal has increased with May facing rebellions from different factions in her party. She only narrowly won a series of votes on Brexit in parliament last week.The Sunday Times poll found voters are increasingly polarised, with growing numbers of people alienated from the two main political parties.Thirty-eight per cent of people would vote for a new right-wing party that is committed to Brexit, while almost a quarter would support an explicitly far-right anti-immigrant, anti-Islam party, the poll found.Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage and US President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon are in discussions about forming a new right-wing movement, according to The Sunday Times.Half of voters would support remaining in the EU if there were a second referendum, the poll found, a level of support found in other surveys this year.YouGov spoke to 1,668 adults in Britain on July 19 and 20, according to The Sunday Times, which did not provide other details about how the poll was conducted.\u00a0The fiercely-guarded \u2018Quantico\u2019 star has finally revealed a huge rock, believed to be a gift from fiance Nick JonasMax - 23 \u00b0CMin - 12 \u00b0CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Apparently, the secret was knowing the sequence in when and how to move the different interconnecting coloured squares at just the right time.Some Rubik wizards could even do it behind their backs. Me? I\u2019d consider it a major victory if I could get even just one face of the six with all 16 squares the same colour. And from what I can remember, it wasn\u2019t often that indeed happened.I think that the Eurocrats in the Berlaymont Building in Brussels must feel as if they\u2019re dealing with a Rubik\u2019s cube in which all the pieces keep moving and nothing stays in place when it comes to Britain and Brexit. If they were surgeons, it\u2019s be like trying to do open heart surgery which the patient is still awake.As someone remarked recently, it\u2019d be a lot easier if the Brits knew exactly what it meant when they voted No, and what they were voting No to. With nine months left before some sort of a Brexit deal is supposed to happen \u2014 or just four months before some sort of a Brexit deal is supposed to be concluded, no one in Brussels, and much less so in Britain where they voted for it, has any idea of what it all means.It\u2019s a mess. And with the European Union leaders and the Commission meeting in three weeks time, the two biggest hurdles of all \u2014 in this whole befuddled, bemuddled, bemused, confused, convoluted behemoth of a dystopian divorce from Europe \u2014 still sit on the table. The customs union and the Irish border.These are the pair of elephants in the cabinet room in 10 Downing Street, and no one sees them. Or more rightly, they\u2019re not looking at them and are hoping they will just somehow go away. As it sits right now, and with those two political pachyderms squatting there, there is no Brexit deal. And it\u2019s about time the Brits realised that.Michel Barnier, the former French minister and the man responsible for leading the EU in the Brexit talks, uses the language of the British playing \u201chide and seek\u201d and claims that the UK\u2019s Prime Minister, Theresa May, is attempting to pin the blame for any damaging consequences due to a lack of progress on Brussels.Sir Ivan Rogers, a sage and savvy squire who was Whitehall\u2019s former chief diplomat at the EU, puts it another, equally disparaging but more revealing way \u2014 and in words that pull few diplomatic punches \u2014 Britain is being misled by the \u201cbuccaneering blather\u201d of hard Brexiters rather than facing the reality that a customs deal had to be done.Sir Ivan can say these things now that he is retired, is no longer constrained by the niceties of his office, nor by control from political masters. He was both the chief Brussels adviser to David Cameron and Theresa May \u2014 and if she needs to get a Brexit deal done, done quickly, and done with a framework that will cause minimal damage to the British economy, Sir Ivan should be brought back in, sat at the table, and get on with getting the whole thing done and dusted.But May this June day is in no position to make such a decision \u2014 she sits at the head of a cabinet so riven by divides that no move is better than any.Damage to the economy?Last week, the Bank of England issued a report that the Brexit mess so far had cost every family in the UK some \u00a3900 (Dh4,390) so far \u2014 the cost of a week\u2019s all-inclusive family holiday in Spain or Greece. Nope, the British tabloid press that so adamantly backs Brexit didn\u2019t run those headlines: \u201cBrexit horror! Bo Jo\u2019s follies steals your jollies\u201d, or \u201cNo Place in the Sun for Eu!\u201dAnd we\u2019re just getting started.Sir Ivan has said he despairs of \u201cpeople professing themselves free traders who have only a hazy understanding about multilateral, regional and bilateral free trade deals, have never negotiated one \u2014 but know it\u2019s straightforward, once one has left the EU.\u201dAnd just who are those deals going to be made with? The US?In the late 1980s and early 1990s, trade negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the US sat down and talked long and hard on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). It\u2019s worked well for decades, so well indeed that the likes of the Big Three automakers of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler had seamless operations across the borders. Parts came from plants in Mexico, were shipped north, and the Big Three liked that Canada\u2019s health care system lowered labour costs \u2014 US health insurance premiums are prohibitive.There were more cars made in Ontario in some quarters, for example, than there were south across the border in Michigan. It, Nafta, worked well until someone in Washington decided otherwise at the drop of a tweet. And that\u2019s who hardline Brexiters would like to do business with.As far as Sir Ivan is concerned, if only May would drop some of her red lines, there\u2019s a decent deal to be done.He sees some sort of quasi-single market deal, paying something for it, living with the European Court of Justice and its jurisprudence and jurisdiction in goods for the Brits. In return, the EU might give a little when it comes to disapplying the freedom of movement principle. That\u2019s the same one that allows thousands of east Europeans to work cleaning cars and flipping burgers in Britain while sending high-value euros back to their low-value home nations.Here\u2019s the thing too. Remember all those refugees that three summers ago trudged from the Middle East and made their way to Munich and Mannheim, Paris and Prague? The EU leadership found a politically expedient way to end that whole freedom of movement thing. So, let\u2019s not talk about principles then.If Britain wants a deal done, it has little time to make that happen. But for that to happen, the prime minister has to lead. And that hasn\u2019t happened yet.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedPalestinians, you\u2019ve got mailAsian-Americans need more moviesSome Australian officials have weak passwordsTrump wants Pompeo to study killing of farmersEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Her assertion of \u201cgovernment sovereignty\u201d has reached crisis point, and it is imperative it is rejected by both the Lords and Commons in the crucial debates on Brexit. The double-crossing of Dominic Grieve \u2014British Conservative politician \u2014 brings the issue to a head.By his and other accounts, May promised Grieve there would be a legal commitment to a \u201cmeaningful\u201d parliamentary vote in the event of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit. On this basis he was persuaded to withdraw his amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, which the government feared it would lose. A day later Grieve secured an acceptable legal text from ministers, which was suddenly withdrawn and replaced by a provision that in case of \u201cno deal\u201d the House of Commons would be allowed only to debate a \u201ctake note\u201d motion, which would be unamendable and meaningless if the government chose to ignore it.This assertion of government sovereignty follows a now established pattern. May\u2019s first step on the Brexit road was her implacable refusal to submit the EU withdrawal notice for parliamentary approval, claiming the royal prerogative. It took a path-breaking decision by the supreme court to force her into parliament. Worried that she might not have a majority to carry hard Brexit through the Commons, the prime minister then called an election, expecting a landslide victory. Instead she got a hung parliament, and has no credible mandate for anything the Commons does not authorise.The reason May is now seeking to solidify \u201cgovernment sovereignty\u201d in advance of the key Brexit votes in parliament this autumn is precisely because she is so weak in parliament. That is all the more reason not to grant her powers that no head of government has assumed since Charles I and James II in the 17th century.If May\u2019s proposal is carried, the House of Commons would be in a weaker position than if there were no advance legal provision whatsoever for what to do in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d. By constitutional practice, the Commons would be free to vote on whatever resolutions it thinks fit under normal circumstances, whereas May is seeking the Commons\u2019 agreement to deprive itself of any meaningful vote in advance. To try to make an argument, ministers are objecting to the word \u201cinstruction\u201d in the Grieve amendment. David Davis, once a poster boy for civil liberties, now asserts that it is wrong for the Commons to seek to \u201cinstruct\u201d the government, and this might give rise to the unacceptable situation of MPs taking over the Brexit negotiations from ministers.Ever the conservative, Grieve is proposing only that parliament should give instructions in the event that the government fails to negotiate any deal at all. As he rightly says, this would be a national emergency, and since \u2014 unless May\u2019s new doctrine is accepted \u2014 parliament is sovereign, it has a duty as much as a right to say what should then happen. It would then be for the government to \u201cexecute\u201d the will of parliament \u2014 which is why it is called the executive. It is absolutely legal and appropriate for the House of Commons to give instructions to the government in such circumstances. There are countless cases where it has done so over the centuries, and it is the essence of our parliamentary democracy.Military actionDavis himself has form on this issue. In 2012, in the argument over Britain\u2019s EU budget contribution, he supported a successful backbench amendment calling on the government to \u201cstrengthen its stance\u201d to reduce it. That\u2019s an instruction. More explicit still are recent Commons\u2019 resolutions on military action, an area where until the Iraq war MPs had often deferred to ministers. To assuage discontent among MPs, former prime minister Tony Blair went to war in 2003 only after the Commons explicitly resolved that it \u201csupports the decision of the Government that the UK should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq\u201d. \u201c It is right that the House debate this issue and pass judgement,\u201d Blair said.The next time the Commons was asked to authorise military action \u2014 by David Cameron, against Syria in 2013 \u2014 it refused to do so, rejecting an explicit motion to \u201cagree to military action\u201d. When the motion was lost, Cameron immediately told MPs: \u201cI believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons. It is very clear that the House does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the government will act accordingly.\u201dTellingly, when May undertook limited military strikes against Al Assad\u2019s regime earlier this year, she refused to summon parliament or table a resolution. Those opposed to such bypassing of parliament didn\u2019t press the issue because the air strikes had already happened by the time parliament met to debate them, and May indicated there would be no more. In retrospect, MPs would have been wise to register their strong objections, whether for or against the action, since it only encouraged May to approach Brexit in the same high-handed manner.The irony is that Brexit is supposed to be about parliament \u201ctaking back control\u201d. That fiction is being steadily exposed for what is in reality a power grab by the right wing of the Conservative party, which is seeking to suppress the party\u2019s moderate and pragmatic MPs \u2014 who, May and Davis know, would be able to command a majority in the Commons if matters went to a vote.That is why it is crucial that both houses of parliament support the Grieve amendment this week. We should do so in the tradition of the Bill of Rights 1689, which declared resistance to James II\u2019s attempt to subvert the \u201claws and liberties\u201d of this kingdom by assuming a power of suspending of laws without consent of parliament.\u2014 Guardian News & Media LtdAndrew Adonis is a Labour peer and former UK transport secretary.\u00a0AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedA new model of human securityThe power games in Syrian conflictDaesh leader Al Baghdadi in new audio messageThousands of Russian troops fought in SyriaEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

And that would be the worst of both worlds, with World Trade Organisation rules coming into effect, with British manufacturers and businesses facing higher costs, delays, and uncertainties, and with the EU27 trying to reach practical agreements on a whole range of day-to-day and strategic matters with an estranged and isolated administration in London.For the past year, Brexit negotiations have been hamstrung by a series of red lines laid down by the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, and she too has been working against a political backdrop largely of her own making \u2014 a divided cabinet, a weakened and compromised position in parliament, and a Conservative party beholden to a hard Brexit element that has led the debate from the onset.Her attempts to reach a consensus position at Chequers earlier this month was an abject failure, exposing the Brexit divisions within her cabinet and threatening her leadership. Indeed, she had adopted positions anew that have been rejected months ago by Brussels, and she is back-pedalling on an agreed backstop position on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south. Given all of this, should we be surprised that the no-deal Brexit seems a very real probability? Not at all, which is why it would be now prudent for all parties to prepare fully for this worst outcome.

Huge effigies of soldiers, teachers, dancers and miscellaneously androgynous life forms twirled in front of us to the irresistible pounding of the band. Everything from sousaphone to clarinet joined in to contribute to the atmosphere.Young couples smiled and danced, heels clicking over the cobblestones that characterize Oaxaca\u2019s central thoroughfare, while fireworks burned haphazardly over the vast legions of floral clad dancers awash with the smell of agave and perfume.An utterly unique atmosphere and one of unbridled joy, happiness and optimism.The cause for the celebration seemed twofold. The imminent festival of the Guelaguetza gives the dancers an opportunity to practice before the main event, while the town\u2019s high school students use this as a stage to enjoy their recent graduation.Soon-to-be-law students and communications majors mingle with the dancers and musicians who have been plying their trade for years.Manuel was wrong, for he had thought that Mexico would eventually get the better of me and I would then come to love it. This idea that Mexico is a nation that has to be worked at to be loved is certainly the preserve of a media bias and something that Manuel, a worker in the tourist industry, surely has to convince the steadily increasing numbers of tourists that visit the country every year.Now I have only been in the country a few days, so the cynical among you will cry that the honeymoon period of the tourist surely masks any negative sentiment. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.Negative sentiment is evident. The sea of tents that festoon the downtown area provide an all too real reminder that all is not well in Oaxaca, despite the festivities. The zone around the principal square, the z\u00f3calo, is bleeding out, a tourist industry hamstrung by the actions of politicians many miles away.However, in the wake of Brexit and the imminent success of the Trump campaign, visitors from both the U.S. or Britain would be hard pressed to say that politics weren\u2019t affecting their daily lives. It just seems we are happier to brush the whole issue under the carpet. Demonstrations rather than celebrations remain the preserve of modern media.I asked Manuel what he thought and he didn\u2019t really seem so fussed. Though it was a big shame for the hotels in the region, he explained that this kind of thing was far from atypical. He and his friends simply stayed positive and got on with things. Poquito a poco.The Scottish school syllabus has little time for the history of Mexico and so, knowing next to nothing, I spent the morning at the local museum of Oaxacan culture, where I learned about the incredible political, social and religious turmoil that has proved the coke in the forge of modern Mexico.So it seems that adversity and overcoming it is a facet of many aspects of Mexican life. Far from being a hindrance, it has helped shape Mexico into the diverse and wonderful country that we can enjoy today.Of course there are issues that make the prospective tourist feel uncomfortable and opt for a a holiday in Europe or a \u201csafer\u201d location but I would implore anyone to visit this utterly unique country.The real Mexico isn\u2019t on either Fox News or the BBC, it\u2019s here in downtown Oaxaca as the eternal drums and brass bands head off southwards, past tent city and into the cool night.Come and see it for yourselves; although the tents may still be here, so will the joy.Louis Rive is a Scottish writer and editor who is spending some time traveling in Mexico.The city of Oaxaca is ready to celebrate its 86th Guelaguetza and offer visitors a unique opportunity to get to know the state\u2019s culture and diversity.A musical recording that blends the popular Mexican song Cielito Lindo with a famous South Korean folk song celebrates the growing friendship between the two countries.Gerry Smith knows books and \u2018Bola\u2019 Domene knows music.
