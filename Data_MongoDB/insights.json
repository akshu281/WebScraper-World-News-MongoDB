moves that Washington alleges are helping Syria bypass the sanctions.The flights in and out of Rostov, which no organisation has previously documented, are operated by Cham Wings, a Syrian airline hit with US sanctions in 2016 for allegedly transporting pro-Assad fighters to Syria and helping Syrian military intelligence transport weapons and equipment.The flights, which almost always land late at night, don't appear in any airport or airline timetables, and fly in from either Damascus or Latakia, a Syrian city where Russia has a military base.The operation lays bare the gaps in the US sanctions, which are designed to starve Assad and his allies in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Hezbollah militia of the men and materiel they need to wage their military campaign.It also provides a glimpse of the methods used to send private Russian military contractors to Syria - a deployment the Kremlin insists does not exist.\nRussian officials say Moscow's presence is limited to air strikes, training of Syrian forces and small numbers of special forces troops.Reuters reporters staked out the Rostov airport, logged the unusual flights using publicly available flight-tracking data, searched aircraft ownership registries and conducted dozens of interviews, including a meeting at a fashionable restaurant with a former Soviet marine major on a US government blacklist.Asked about the flights and the activities of Russian private military contractors in Syria, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin referred Reuters to the Defence Ministry - which didn't reply to the questions.The Syrian government also didn't reply to questions.In response to detailed Reuters questions, Cham Wings said only that information on where it flies was available on its website.The flights to Rostov aren't mentioned on the site.\nThe planes were then sold or leased and ended up being operated by Iranian and Syrian airlines, according to the flight-tracking data.One of the companies, Khors, and the former marine major, Sergei Tomchani, have been on a US Commerce Department blacklist since 2011 for allegedly exporting aircraft to Iran and Syria without obtaining licences from Washington.But in the past seven years, Khors and Dart have managed to acquire or lease 84 second-hand Airbus and Boeing aircraft by passing the aircraft through layers of non-sanctioned entities, according to information collated by Reuters from national aircraft registers.Of these 84 aircraft, at least 40 have since been used in Iran, Syria and Iraq, according to data from three flight-tracking websites, which show the routes aircraft fly and give the call sign of the company operating them.In September, the US Treasury Department added Khors and Dart to its sanctions blacklist, saying they were helping sanctioned airlines procure US-made aircraft.\nOn Aug 20, 2015, Khors became the aircraft's operator, the register showed.A representative of the Ukraine State Aviation Service said the register was not intended as official confirmation of ownership but that there had been no complaints about the accuracy of its information.From April that year, the aircraft was flown by Cham Wings, according to data from the flight-tracking websites.Gillian Culhane, a spokeswoman for AerCap, the firm whose subsidiary owned the plane in 2015, didn't respond to written questions or answer repeated phone calls seeking comment about what AerCap knew about the subsequent owners and operators of the plane.\nUkrainian military intelligence said it has no knowledge of the supply of aircraft to Syria, has no connection to the transport of military contractors from Russia to Syria, and hasn't cooperated with Khors, Dart or Cham Wings.On Jan 9 this year, Dart changed its name to Alanna, and listed a new address and founders, according to the Ukrainian business register.\nThe widow of one contractor killed in Syria said the last time she spoke to her husband by phone was on Jan 21 last year -

to quote Obama again - that“Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are decapacitated and it is only strengthening ISIL”.The people Obama is referring to - the \"folks\" who may be \"driven underground\" or \"decapacitated\" - are the people the US is supporting in the fight against President Assad.It is now universally admitted these people are overwhelmingly Sunni militants - in other words armed jihadis - violently opposed to what they see as an apostate secular Alawite led government in Syria.\nSince the US backed jihadis are only motivated to fight President Assad, and will not fight the Islamic State in any meaningful way, when the two come into conflict the US backed jihadis tend to defect to the Islamic State .The distinction the US therefore makes between a “moderate” armed opposition to President Assad and the Islamic State, has no meaningful ideological - and therefore political - reality.The only difference between the two groups is that the first - a militant jihadi group supported by the US - is focused on overthrowing President Assad, whilst the second - a militant jihadi group opposed by the US - is focused on expanding its territory.The victory of either group following the defeat of the Syrian government would however have the same result: the establishment of a violent sectarian jihadi state in Syria.\nIn practice, since the Islamic State is by far the better organised of the two groups attracting regular defections from the other group, its eventual victory would be all but certain.The key point - as Putin said in his UN speech - is that the only force in Syria that can be reliably trusted to fight the Islamic State is the Syrian army, together with its allies the Kurds and Hezbollah.To pretend otherwise is fantasy, denying the reality of the situation.What of repeated Western claims that the Syrian government is in some sort of implicit alliance with the Islamic State to weaken the anti-Assad opposition, and is not really fighting it?Putin has called this anti-Syrian propaganda and he is right.The problem is not that the Syrian army does not want to fight the Islamic State.\nFour years have been hopelessly wasted in negotiations that always began and ended with the Western demand that Assad must go or, at the most, go after a little while.It is absurd to think – as Assad’s foes seemed to believe through their latest offers – that conceding that Assad might remain for a few weeks or months could somehow reassure Russia and Iran of their long-term interests in Syria.It is the long-term character of the Syrian state, its political system and what this means for its foreign relations that has been the primary obstacle to successful negotiations on Syria.It all comes down to a simple principle of commerce."}

Donald Trump, saying that it was not appropriate for the pope to question Trump’s Christian faith.Ben Carson, in a brief instance of consciousness, said “enforcing our immigration laws is not in contradiction of love and kindness.” (Strange, coming from a man who has proposed drone strikes at the border, the desert itself apparently not efficient enough in dealing death to children.)Jeb!\nIn 2015, during the pope’s U.S. visit, Chris Christie said, “I just think the pope is wrong.” He went on to pontificate (what a glorious verb) that the pope was only infallible on religious matters and not political ones, as if one could possibly separate the two, especially in America.It has now become a point of pride among GOP politicians to openly disagree with the pontiff."}

One of the key things people want answers about is the document both leaders signed.Mr Trump has so far only said it was a “very important document, a pretty comprehensive document”.4.30pmTrump, Kim commit to ‘complete denuclearisation’Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have committed to the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula in a joint text.The document signed by both leaders specifies four key agreements between the US and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).Here’s what the document said — and a brief explanation of what each point means.1.\nI also learnt that he loves his country very much.”The President said he would “absolutely” invite the North Korean leader to the White House in Washington, echoing a similar comment he made last week.3.50pmTrump and Kim sign documentsDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down and signed a series of documents together.While the contents are yet to be specified, they said it “worked out better than anyone could have predicted”, adding that “the world will see a major change” from it.“We are signing a very important document, a pretty comprehensive document, and we have had a really great term together, a great relationship,” Mr Trump said before signing.He described “three comprehensive documents” and said they’d be handed out at a news conference this afternoon.He added that a lot of “goodwill” and “preparation” went into the letter, and noted that himself and Kim have a “special bond”.“We’re going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,” the US President said.“It actually worked out far better for both of us than anyone would have predicted.\nThe world will see major change,” added Kim. He also expressed his thanks to Mr Trump for making the meeting happen.The pair sat side-by-side at a long wooden table decorated with white flowers, flanked with North Korean and American flags on either side.More details are expected to be announced when Mr Trump addresses the media later this evening.2.40pmTrump and Kim meeting goes off-script The summit has taken a strange new turn, with Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un now getting ready to sign a never-mentioned document.When the two leaders emerged from their working lunch, Mr Trump said things were going “better than anybody could have expected”.“It’s going great, we had a really fantastic meeting, lot of progress, really very positive.\nI think better than anybody could have expected, top of the line, really good,” Mr Trump said of their meetings.He then said “we are going right now for a signing”, noting there would be more details on the signing in a few minutes.The signing was not part of the original meeting schedule and this is the first time it’s been mentioned today.The pair spent the next few minutes checking out Mr Trump’s presidential limousine, which some experts have described as a “bonding” ritual.A US official told CNN the pair would sign an agreement to acknowledge their meetings’ progress and pledge to keep momentum going.2.20pmTrump’s Dennis Rodman tweet making the roundsA tweet Donald Trump posted in 2014 is once again making the rounds on social media.A few hours ago, Rodman broke down during a live interview with CNN while expressing his sentiments on the summit.When the former NBA star was asked what it was like when he visited North Korea and returned home during the Obama administration, he responded: “Obama didn’t even give me the time of day.\nI showed my loyalty to this country, and I said to everybody, ‘The door will open.’”He said today was “a great day for everyone” and that he was “so happy” that Mr Trump had met with Kim.Here were some of the responses to the 2014 tweet:Here is Trump saying that Dennis Rodman was either high or drunk when he said that Trump wanted to go to North Korea with him (2014)As most of us know, Dennis is in NK rn to help with the #TrumpKimSummit Trump must be infinite parallel universe versions of himself.#Resist https://t.co/caOwAbG65x2.05pmNorth Korea still left in the darkNorth Koreans still haven’t seen any updates on the summit, according to Martyn Williams, a British journalist in the hermit nation.He tweeted a photo of the satellite feed he was picking up:Earlier it was reported that North Koreans didn’t even know about the meeting until yesterday morning.This marked a break in tradition, as announcements of Kim’s meetings with other world leaders are usually kept under wraps until he’s back in the country.1.45pmThe question Kim refused to answerDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un appeared warm and pleasant before and after their private meeting — but there’s one question the North Korean dictator refused to answer.When the 38-minute meeting concluded, the leaders waved their hands and approached the deck where foreign journalists were waiting.Kim was reportedly asked three times about denuclearisation, but he smiled and said nothing according to the White House press pool.The North Korean leader was asked twice, “Chairman Kim, will you denuclearise?” and said nothing.\nIt will be done.”It’s likely Mr Trump was referring to the need to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.More details of this exchange are expected when he addresses the media at 6pm (AEST).Press have now left the room and an expanded working lunch will get under way.11.50pmPrivate meeting ends between Trump and Kim The one-on-one meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un finished after 38 minutes, according to the White House press pool.As they left, Mr Trump said the meeting was “very, very good” and that they have an “excellent relationship”, according to Associated Press.The pair smiled a few times as they walked along the breezeway.“Many people in the world will think of this as a ...\nfrom a science fiction movie,” Kim’s translator said at the end of the last breezeway walk, according to audio from CNN.11.40amDennis Rodman breaks down during interviewThe former NBA star burst into tears during a passionate live interview about the summit.Appearing on CNN in a “Make America Great Again” hat and sunglasses shortly after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un exchanged greetings, Dennis Rodman became emotional when he was asked what it was like when he visited North Korea and returned home during the Obama administration.“Obama didn’t even give me the time of day,” he said.\nMr Trump gave Kim a thumbs up as he said “we overcame all”.They exchanged another handshake and touched each other on the arm.Both leaders have been openly smiling.11.05amKim and Trump meet face-to-faceIn a historic moment, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have met face-to-face for the first time, appearing before the media in front of the American and North Korean flags at the Capella Hotel in Singapore.At 9.04am, Mr Trump and Mr Kim approached from opposite sides of a white colonnade, shook hands and posed for photo.\nI think very quickly I’ll know whether or not something good is going to happen.”9.30amMike Pompeo departs for summitSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been snapped on his way to the summit.Addressing the media in Singapore yesterday, Mr Pompeo said the meeting is “truly a mission of peace”.“North Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearise, and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere,” he said.\n“The fact that our two leaders are sitting down face-to-face is a sign of the enormous potential to accomplish something that will immensely benefit both of our peoples and the entire world.”He said he is “hopeful” the summit will “set the conditions for future productive talks”.Mr Pompeo will not be part of the initial meeting at 11.15am (AEST), which according to the White House will consist solely of Mr Trump, Mr Kim and their respective translators.8.45amTrump hits back at ‘haters and losers’Donald Trump has issued another tweet this morning — this time faulting the unnamed “haters and losers” who opposed the summit.He notes North Korea releasing a trio of US citizen hostages and halting missile tests after floating talks.Earlier this month, Kim Jong-un released three American hostages who had been held for months in the reclusive country.","processed_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:37:03.360Z"}}

President Donald Trump says he thinks 'we'll probably need another summit'- or at least a second meeting - with North Korea's Kim Jong-un as they discuss Kim's commitment to denuclearisation.But Trump told reporters in Singapore on Tuesday that he and Kim were able to cover far more ground than he'd expected.\nChina suggested on Tuesday that sanctions relief could be considered for North Korea if the country abides by United Nations resolutions, as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work for denuclearisation.China has signed up for increasingly tough UN sanctions against its isolated neighbour following Pyongyang's repeated nuclear and missile tests, but has always said sanctions should be accompanied by talks for a political resolution.Speaking in Beijing following Trump and Kim's signing of a joint statement at the end of their historic summit in Singapore, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China has always strictly abided by all UN resolutions on North Korea.He said: 'The UN Security Council resolutions that have been passed say that if North Korea respects and acts in accordance with the resolutions, then sanction measures can be adjusted, including to pause or remove the relevant sanctions.' President Donald Trump says he had planned to place another 300 sanctions on North Korea recently, but he held off because it would be 'disrespectful' ahead of the meeting.Trump said Tuesday at a news conference in Singapore following his summit with Kim Jong-un that the U.S. will remove the sanctions already in place when they're assured that the nuclear weapons 'are no longer a factor.'He also says that it takes 'a long time to pull off complete denuclearisation' but that he will push for North Korea to remove its nuclear weapons as fast as it can 'mechanically and physically' be done."}

with Kim Jong-un for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and his plans to invite the North Korean leader to the White House.This live briefing has ended.\nSee our main story on the North Korea summit here.President Trump, after a daylong historic summit with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un on Tuesday, announced plans to suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula and said he expected Mr. Kim to move “very quickly” to dismantle his country’s nuclear arsenal.The summit meeting was the first of its kind between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader, and it ended in a joint statement that opened the door to ending seven decades of hostility between the two countries.Mr. Trump said at a news conference that the United States would stop “the war games,” in what appeared to be a concession to the North.\nHe said the exercises were expensive and “very provocative,” though both the Pentagon and South Korean military were caught off guard by the announcement.In a joint statement after the leaders’ first face-to-face meeting, the United States “committed to provide security guarantees” to the North.\nIn exchange, Mr. Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But Mr. Trump said economic sanctions against North Korea would remain in place.Here’s what happened:• The two leaders first met privately for less than an hour in a one-on-one session with interpreters present, before breaking off for a larger meeting and then a working lunch with aides.Advertisement• The leaders signed their joint statement, in which the United States committed to providing guarantees of security to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization.• “We had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,” Mr. Kim said as he and Mr. Trump signed the joint statement, adding, “The world will see a major change.”Mr. Trump was similarly optimistic saying, “We are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world.”• Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim departed Singapore hours after their meeting.\nIt was not immediately released to reporters, but was legible in a photo of Mr. Trump holding it up at the ceremony.The statement said the two nations would hold “follow-on negotiations” led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a high-level North Korean official “at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes” of the summit meeting.AdvertisementThe statement also said the two nations would “join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime” on the divided Korean Peninsula, meaning talks to reduce military tensions that could eventually lead to a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War.During a meeting in Singapore, Donald Trump presented Kim Jong-un with a short video depicting the prosperity that could come with peace.\nThe annual exercises have been an integral part of the alliance with the United States that forms the bulwark of South Korea’s defenses against the North.Mr. Trump’s pronouncement raised fears that Washington was making concessions before North Korea had actually dismantled its nuclear weapons.AdvertisementThe South Korean Defense Ministry issued a curt statement saying that it was trying to determine Mr. Trump’s intentions.Despite the uncertainty, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea celebrated the meeting’s outcome, calling it “a historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on earth.”“I pay my high compliments for the courage and determination of the two leaders, President Trump and Chairman Kim, not to settle for that outdated and familiar reality but to take a daring step toward change,” Mr. Moon said.“Once again, I would like to pay my respects to President Trump, who achieved a feat that no one else has ever delivered,” he said.At the end of their meeting, Mr. Kim pledged to destroy a missile-engine testing site, Mr. Trump told reporters, in what he characterized as a last-minute decision that was not included in the joint agreement.“I got that after we signed the agreement,” Mr. Trump said of the concession.\nWe know where it is because of the heat.’ It’s incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you.”The death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was detained in North Korea, helped precipitate the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the president said on Tuesday at a post-summit meeting news conference.“I think without Otto this would not have happened,” Mr. Trump said.\nHe was repatriated to the United States in a coma after 17 months in detention and then died.“The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim,” Mr. Trump said in a statement at the time of Mr. Warmbier’s death.Mr. Trump, who was a developer before he became president, focused on one particular economic prospect for North Korea: real estate.“As an example, they have great beaches,” he said during a news conference after his meeting with Mr. Kim.\nIt’s great.”For Americans who never got to bury loved ones killed in the Korean War, the summit meeting offered new hope.The joint statement signed by both leaders said their two countries were committed to recovering and repatriating the remains of soldiers who were designated captured or missing at the end of the conflict in 1953.Of the 82,000 American service members still missing from the wars of the past century, 7,702 are from the Korean War, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is responsible for recovering missing personnel from around the world.AdvertisementAn estimated 120,000 South Korean troops and police officers are also unaccounted for in the Korean War.Mr. Trump, in his post-meeting news conference, said he had received “countless calls and letters” from family members asking him to discuss the issue with Mr. Kim.“The remains will be coming back,” Mr. Trump said.\n“They’re going to start that process immediately.”China welcomed the news from Singapore and patted itself on the back.“I think nobody can doubt the extremely unique and important role China has played,” said Wang Yi, the foreign minister.Mr. Wang may have been so pleased because of Mr. Trump’s decision to suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.China floated that idea last year, suggesting that the North suspend its weapons program in exchange for an end to American military exercises.Chinese experts on North Korea, however, were underwhelmed by the summit meeting’s outcome.“Well below my expectation,” Cheng Xiaohe of Renmin University said of the joint statement.\nSo far Trump has failed to prove himself a dealmaker.”Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized the president’s seemingly cozy relationship with North Korea and said the declaration signed by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was “very light on details” in a statement hours after the meetingAdvertisement“Talking to dictators is one thing; embracing them is another,” Mr. Biden said.\nWhile Mr. Trump gained little from the meeting, the North Koreans had much to gain, he said.Mr. Biden urged the president to remember the “horrendous human rights abuses North Korean leaders perpetrate against their own people” and called Mr. Trump’s claim that preparation for the meeting was unimportant “inexcusable and irresponsible.”“North Korea gained the legitimacy of a meeting with the American president; the easing of the international economic and sanctions pressure, carefully built over the last two administrations; and the suspension of our military readiness exercises with South Korea — a decision apparently made without consulting our ally,” Mr. Biden said in his statement.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim departed Singapore just hours after their meeting.\nWhen Mr. Trump played host to President Xi Jinping of China, he boasted about serving “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen.”In deference to Mr. Kim, there was also another Korean dish, Daegu jorim, described as soy braised cod fish with radish and Asian vegetables.Reporting was contributed by Russell Goldman from Hong Kong, Mark Landler and Motoko Rich from Singapore, Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea, Richard Pérez-Peña and Michael Wolgelenter from London, Eric Schmitt from Washington, Megan Specia from New York and Jose A.\nJust like the kids game of Monopoly - not much thinking, roll the dice, hope you land on the right spot, buy more hotels till you get tired of winning.Sure, North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons.I've got a bridge that I'd like to sell to President Trump.Trump would have done better not to mention Otto Warmbier, who was detained, tortured and died at the hands of the North Koreans."}

basically social media marketing, precisely the sort of thing being so actively discussed now around the Cambridge Analytica / Facebook scandal.If you are reading this and happen to be massively rich, or are the leader of a large northern nuclear power, and want to avert Armageddon, the smartest thing you can do right now is to start handing out not terribly large chunks of cash to about 100 top alternative political sites, blogs, and freelancers on the right and the left.We disagree on a lot of things, but we ALL see the insanity of this march to war with Russia.\nGiven some resources, our collective voices, superior intellect and talent and, most importantly, the fact that the truth is inarguably on our side, will be enough to face down the liars who own and run the mainstream media.One thing I can tell you for sure is that a whole new generation of scrappy media companies who know how to be lean and effective have emerged over the past 10 years.\nDONATE NOW  Why $300,000, and what's the strategy?(This next part, the bulk of the article, is technical stuff about how we will run the fund drive and an analysis of why alt-media has trouble raising money.I find this sort of thing intensely interesting, but I am weird that way.\nOther alt-media entrepreneurs, note well what I write here, it is free advice which I have learned from my personal experience over the past 3 years.As I said, the main problem for most alt-media sites is lack of capital, which really stems from their inability to raise it.\nBecause the fundraising will be taking more time, and because I will be doing more media appearances as part of that, I need a couple of writers / editors to keep the flow of articles on RI at their present level.\nThe way it works in most cases is that the editorial staff appeals to the readership to pitch in a few times a year, and among a very few handful of sites that have a devoted enough following, this brings in just enough to kind of, sort of, make ends meet, but not really.This is not a formula for success, believe me.\nThis too is extraordinary, a ringing endorsement of our approach and positions.That is a near miracle considering the resources we have had to build this, and it shows how much can be done with relatively modest funds by smart, determined people armed with the truth.What I will advocate for with your funds:Stopping the insane and dangerous hating on Russia and the march to war with her being pushed by our media, and calling out the liars in government and media.Stopping the encroaching censorship being orchestrated by the Deep State – there can be no more vital issue which we Americans have to stand up for at this time.\nI have devoted the last three years of my life to speaking out about this, at great personal sacrifice to myself and my family.I returned to Connecticut because I realized that there is only so much one can achieve with harangues from across the ocean, and I urge you to join me in this fight, for a fight it most certainly is, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.Our same government and media, hijacked by un-American psychopaths, who are driving our country to war, are also destroying our country from within.\nI am a convinced and committed Christian, and talk and write about my faith, and operate a website about Christianity in Russia called 'Russian Faith'.I return to my home country outraged at what my government is doing at home and abroad, and determined to do what I can to fight what can only be described as treason.Two things I detest most are dishonesty and betrayal, and fear is not an emotion I feel much, other than a fear of God.It is time to actI can assure you that the Russian people are as good and kind and generous a Christian people of high character as you will find anywhere, and that their leaders reflect that character.\nMr. Putin is a good man, a sincere Christian, and a brilliant leader who has been viciously slandered by those same liars in the media who are destroying our own country, and slandering our own President.Most of what most Americans know about Russia, both past and present, is a grotesque lie, peddled by our media."}
