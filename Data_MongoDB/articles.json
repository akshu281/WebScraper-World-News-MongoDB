Watch their first official remarks to to one another here.THEY shook hands, ate lunch, posed for photos and talked — and as Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un did so, the world waited and watched enthralled.The meeting between the two leaders was billed as the summit of the century. Whether or not it lives up to that hype will largely be determined by what follows after the historic meeting in Singapore in the coming weeks and months.President Trump was in his usual form when he spoke with media for almost an hour in an extraordinary media conference. He was confident of a breakthrough in US-NK relations, but hedged his bets somewhat and placed much of the onus on his counterpart’s shoulders.Mr Trump was particularly impressed when Kim vowed to destroy a nuclear missile testing site.“I think he’ll do it. I really believe that — otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this … It was really the engine-testing site in addition to all of the other things that they’ve agreed to do,” he said.But time will tell.Speaking to hundreds of journalists, Mr Trump made an extraordinarily frank admission.“I may stand before you in six months and say, ‘Hey, I was wrong.’ I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that, but I’ll find some kind of excuse,” he said, to the amusement of his audience.The deal which Mr Trump and Chairman Kim agreed has already been criticised for lacking detail or a time-frame on when anything will be achieved by. Instead, it sought to establish new relations between the two countries.But Kim has committed to “fully” move towards denuclearisation. In return, the US and South Korea will abandon their military exercisesKim and Mr Trump spent almost 40 minutes of their summit with only translators, which is not normal diplomatic protocol. They were then joined by members of their own delegations for an extended bilateral.The remains of prisoners of war from the 1950-1953 Korean War would also be repatriated — something Mr Trump said Kim agreed to very easily.The US leader paid tribute to American student Otto Warmbier, who died of a brain damage after being arrested in North Korea. He said his death was not in vain and was a catalyst for the summit.After lunch came a chance to pose for a picture many thought they would never see. On one side was the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), a ruthless dictator, and the other the reality show host turned US President.They shook hands and smiled. The handshake lasted 13 seconds and was without any of the vigorous antics other world leaders have endured from Mr Trump.Nothing could ever be taken for granted or assumed, Mr Trump said — but he had been a deal maker “my whole life” and “it’s my thing”.He added: “You can’t ensure anything. All I can say is that they want to make a deal. That’s what I do. My whole life has been deals. I’ve done great at it. That’s what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn’t. A lot of politicians don’t.”There were plenty of sledges of former US presidents, from Bill Clinton — who famously gave North Korea billions to abandon their nuclear program — to Barack Obama, who Mr Trump implied had allowed the situation to fester.“This really could have been done I think easier a long time ago, but I know — I just feel very strongly, my instinct, my ability or talent, they want to make a deal and making a deal is a great thing for the world,” said the President.Many doubted the pair would ever meet. Until last week the meeting was in doubt and it was only a few short months ago that Mr Trump derided Kim as “rocket man” for his attempts to establish nuclear missiles.But the US President appeared to be satisfied the ends justified the means, acknowledging the summit might not have happened without the fiery rhetoric.“Well at that time we needed perhaps fire and fury because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States and certainly Japan wasn’t going to allow it either,” he said. “Japan is right next door.”He did not repeat the threats yesterday — in public or private. “That’s a tough thing to talk about because I don’t want to be threatening. They understood that.”At his media conference, he faced several questions about what exactly the US got from the meeting. He claimed he gave up nothing — and insisted the crippling sanctions would remain.“The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor. Sanctions played a big role but they’ll come off at that point. I hope it’s gonna be soon. But they’ll come off — as you know and as I have said, the sanctions right now remain but at a certain point I actually look forward to taking them off and they’ll come off when we know we’re down the road.”In other words, it would be business as usual until North Korea made moves towards denuclearisation.“We talked about the guarantees and we talked about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. This is the document that we just signed,” said Mr Trump.The wait may not be a long one. Kim has promised “complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” in the document which both leaders signed at the end of their meeting.“Today we have had a historic meeting, we decided to leave the past behind,” Kim said through an interpreter.“The world will see a major change. I would like to express my gratitude to President Trump for making this meeting happen.”Mr Trump added: “A lot of goodwill went into this, a lot of work, a lot of preparation. We’re very proud of what took place today.“We are prepared to start a new history and we are ready to write a new chapter between our two nations.“We have developed a very special bond.”Asked how he could praise Kim as “talented” when he had along history of violent crimes against his people, Mr Trump responded: “He is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don’t say it was nice, he ran it — very few people at that age [could do it] you can take one out of 10,000 probably who could.”Many commentators contrasted his new-found affection for Kim to the contempt he showed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the G7 meeting at the weekend. He branded Mr Trudeau “weak” after he gave a news conference about US “bullying”.“When I got to the plane, I think Justin didn’t know Air Force one has about 20 televisions, and I see the television and he’s giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. I say, ‘Push him around? We just shook hands.’ It was very friendly.”He continued by saying he thought his friendship with Mr Trudeau was strong — but so was his bond with Kim.“I think I have a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now, I really do. I hope it’s good because if it is we’re going to solve a very big problem.”After their meeting, Kim said to Mr Trump through an interpreter: “Many people in the world will think of this as a form of fantasy … from a science fiction movie.”For once, maybe the North Korean leader was right about something.andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

At the epic media briefing that followed the summit, Mr Trump claimed not to have slept for 25 hours. As the leaders finally depart, read our full wrap of the momentous day here.7.10pmOn meeting KimBefore the summit, Mr Trump said he was sure he would know how successful it would be in the first minute. He did not back away from that today — in fact, he said it took far less than that.“Yeah, I have said that about relationships, I have said that about people. You know, [I can tell] in the first second. I was generous and said five seconds but you know in the first second in some cases. Sometimes that doesn’t work out, but sometimes it does. From the beginning we got along, but there’s been a lot of groundwork [by officials before the meeting].”He said he trusted Kim to follow through on what he had promised. “I think he’ll do it. I really believe that — otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this.”He was sure the destruction of the engine missile site would be a major turning point.“I may stand before you in six months and say, ‘Hey, I was wrong.’ I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that but I’ll find some kind of excuse,” he said to laughter from the hundreds of journalists.6.58pmNorth Korea want to make a deal, but I can’t be certain, says Trump Mr Trump said nothing could be assumed or taken for granted. He said he had been making deals his whole life and was confident North Korea and Kim wanted a deal as well.“You can’t ensure anything. All I can say is that they want to make a deal. That’s what I do. My whole life has been deals. I’ve done great at it. That’s what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal and I know when somebody doesn’t. A lot of politicians don’t. That’s not their thing but it is my thing. Again, this really could have been done I think easier a long time ago, but I know — I just feel very strongly, my instinct, my ability or talent, they want to make a deal and making a deal is a great thing for the world.”6.54pmTrump sledges Trudeau again - and speaks about the viral Angela Merkel pictureMr Trump has not backed away from previous statements he made about the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau being dishonest and weak.He was asked about the statements and the recent tension with other G7 leaders, especially over trade.“I had a very good meeting at the G7 — I’ll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries,” he said. “Anyway, we finished the meeting ... everybody was happy and I agreed to sign something. I asked for changes. I demanded changes. Those changes were made. The picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I’m sitting there like that, that picture is we’re waiting for the document because I wanted to see the final document [with changes] as I requested. It was friendly. I know it didn’t look friendly, it wasn’t nasty both ways, I wasn’t angry at her. Actually we were talking about the whole group about something unrelated to anything, very friendly, waiting for the document back to read.”He then saw Mr Trudeau’s media conference, and it made him angry. “When I got to the plane, I think Justin didn’t know Air Force one has about 20 televisions, and I see the television and he’s giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. I say, ‘Push him around? We just shook hands.’ It was very friendly.”Mr Trudeau’s comments would cost Canadians, he added.6.46pmTrump: I don’t want to be threateningMr Trump said he didn’t raise military options with Kim after previously threatening to destroy him. He told the reporter who asked about it the question was fair, given the previous rhetoric.“Yeah, I know. That’s a tough thing to talk about because I don’t want to be threatening. They understood that.”Asked about his promise of “fire and fury”, he said: “Well, at that time we needed perhaps fire and fury because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States and certainly Japan wasn’t going to allow it either. Japan is right next door.”6.43pmSanctions will remain for nowMr Trump said the sanctions against North Korea would remain until the US was satisfied denuclearisation was happening.“The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor. Sanctions played a big role but they’ll come off at that point. I hope it’s gonna be soon. But they’ll come off — as you know and as I have said, the sanctions right now remain, but at a certain point, I actually look forward to taking them off, and they’ll come off when we know we’re down the road where it’s not going to happen, nothing is going to happen.6.37pmHuman rights was spoken about — briefly.Mr Trump said it was discussed, but denuclearisation was the key focus.“Obviously that’s where we started and where we ended. But they will be doing things, and I think he [Kim] wants to do things. I think he wants to — you’d be very surprised. Very smart, very good negotiator. Wants to do the right thing. You know, he brought up the fact that in the past they took dialogue — they never were like we are.”He said there had not been anything like what was being proposed now.He said there had been previous pledges from the North Koreans — especially after a deal with President Clinton in 1994 — that achieved nothing, with “millions” given by the US failing stop the nuclear program.“But this is a much different time and this is a much different president, in all fairness,” said Mr Trump. “This is very important to me.”6.34pmNo concessions by the US, Trump saysMr Trump denied the US had conceded anything on the subject of verifiable or irreversible denuclearisation. He pointed to the contract the two leaders had just signed.“Not at all. If you look at it — it said we are going to, let’s see here — it will be gone, I don’t think you can be any more plain than what we’re asking — issues relating to the establishment of the new US-DPRK relationship. We talk about the guarantees and we talk about unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. This is the document that we just signed.”6.31pmRemains of POWs will be returned to the USThis was something Mr Trump had not planned on raising. He did so almost at the last minute.“The remains will be coming back. They’re going to start that process immediately. But so many people, even during the campaign, they’d say, ‘Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back? Or my father back?’ So many people asked me this question, and, you know, I said, ‘Look, we don’t get along too well with that particular group of people, but know do,’” Mr Trump said.“He agreed to that so quickly. It was a very nice thing and he understands it. So for the thousands and thousands, I guess way over 6000 that we know of in terms of the remains, they’ll be brought back.”6.26pm ‘He is very talented’Mr Trump was asked by a journalist how he could praise Kim and call him “talented” when he had been a murderous dictator.“He is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don’t say it was nice, he ran it — very few people at that age, you can take one out of 10,000 probably who couldn’t do it.”6.20pmNorth Korea to destroy missile testing siteMr Trump said he has been told by Kim that a nuclear missile testing site will be destroyed.He said the situation on the Korean Peninsula should have been resolved years ago.“We’re going to resolve it.”6.16pmTrump: This was historicThe US President thanked his counterparts in Singapore, Japan and China for their help in getting to this “very historic day”.He said his meeting with Kim was productive and the two were ready to move towards a stronger, peaceful future.“The past does not have to define the future...adversarys can indeed become freinds [and] replace the horror of battle with blessings of peace”.5.48pmTrump media conference to start soonMr Trump is about to speak to media about his historic summit with Kim. One of the key things people want answers about is the document both leaders signed.Mr Trump has so far only said it was a “very important document, a pretty comprehensive document”.4.30pmTrump, Kim commit to ‘complete denuclearisation’Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have committed to the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula in a joint text.The document signed by both leaders specifies four key agreements between the US and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).Here’s what the document said — and a brief explanation of what each point means.1.  The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the people of the two counties for peace and prosperity.This serves as an acknowledgement that the US and North Korea are seeking to leave their hostilies behind and move towards peace.2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.Until now, the US and South Korea have had an alliance against North Korea and its nuclear regime. This means the US and North Korea will move towards dialogue and pursue an end to their hostile relationship.3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.The Panmunjom Declaration was adopted by North and South Korea during the 2018 inter-Korean Summit in April. It stated that the two sides would agree to work together to end the Korean War and bring about a new era of peace, including denuclearisation. This point serves as a reiteration of that.4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.The United States and North Korea will work together to identify the remains of American Korean War casualties — a move veterans advocates have been pushing for. Over 7000 American service members from the war remain unaccounted for.We’re still yet to hear anything about the process for denuclearisation, whether the US will lift its “maximum pressure” sanctions on North Korea or any other potential concessions that went into the deal.However, Mr Trump is expected to make a joint press conference in a few minutes. Stay tuned.4.00pmKim and Trump say goodbyeDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have officially said their warm farewells.Mr Trump spoke glowingly of the North Korean dictator, saying he has a “great personality” and is “very smart”.When asked if he was a worthy negotiator, Mr Trump responded: “A worthy negotiator...a very worthy, very smart negotiator. We had a terrific day and we learned a lot about each other and our countries.”When pressed to elaborate on what he learnt from Kim, he said: “I learnt he’s a very talented man. I also learnt that he loves his country very much.”The President said he would “absolutely” invite the North Korean leader to the White House in Washington, echoing a similar comment he made last week.3.50pmTrump and Kim sign documentsDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down and signed a series of documents together.While the contents are yet to be specified, they said it “worked out better than anyone could have predicted”, adding that “the world will see a major change” from it.“We are signing a very important document, a pretty comprehensive document, and we have had a really great term together, a great relationship,” Mr Trump said before signing.He described “three comprehensive documents” and said they’d be handed out at a news conference this afternoon.He added that a lot of “goodwill” and “preparation” went into the letter, and noted that himself and Kim have a “special bond”.“We’re going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,” the US President said.“It actually worked out far better for both of us than anyone would have predicted. This is going to lead to more and more and more... and it’s an honour to be with you.”“We are going to leave the past behind. The world will see major change,” added Kim. He also expressed his thanks to Mr Trump for making the meeting happen.The pair sat side-by-side at a long wooden table decorated with white flowers, flanked with North Korean and American flags on either side.More details are expected to be announced when Mr Trump addresses the media later this evening.2.40pmTrump and Kim meeting goes off-script The summit has taken a strange new turn, with Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un now getting ready to sign a never-mentioned document.When the two leaders emerged from their working lunch, Mr Trump said things were going “better than anybody could have expected”.“It’s going great, we had a really fantastic meeting, lot of progress, really very positive. I think better than anybody could have expected, top of the line, really good,” Mr Trump said of their meetings.He then said “we are going right now for a signing”, noting there would be more details on the signing in a few minutes.The signing was not part of the original meeting schedule and this is the first time it’s been mentioned today.The pair spent the next few minutes checking out Mr Trump’s presidential limousine, which some experts have described as a “bonding” ritual.A US official told CNN the pair would sign an agreement to acknowledge their meetings’ progress and pledge to keep momentum going.2.20pmTrump’s Dennis Rodman tweet making the roundsA tweet Donald Trump posted in 2014 is once again making the rounds on social media.A few hours ago, Rodman broke down during a live interview with CNN while expressing his sentiments on the summit.When the former NBA star was asked what it was like when he visited North Korea and returned home during the Obama administration, he responded: “Obama didn’t even give me the time of day. I asked him — I said, I have something to say from North Korea. He just brushed me off. But that didn’t deter me.“I kept going back ... I showed my loyalty to this country, and I said to everybody, ‘The door will open.’”He said today was “a great day for everyone” and that he was “so happy” that Mr Trump had met with Kim.Here were some of the responses to the 2014 tweet:Here is Trump saying that Dennis Rodman was either high or drunk when he said that Trump wanted to go to North Korea with him (2014)As most of us know, Dennis is in NK rn to help with the #TrumpKimSummit Trump must be infinite parallel universe versions of himself.#Resist https://t.co/caOwAbG65x2.05pmNorth Korea still left in the darkNorth Koreans still haven’t seen any updates on the summit, according to Martyn Williams, a British journalist in the hermit nation.He tweeted a photo of the satellite feed he was picking up:Earlier it was reported that North Koreans didn’t even know about the meeting until yesterday morning.This marked a break in tradition, as announcements of Kim’s meetings with other world leaders are usually kept under wraps until he’s back in the country.1.45pmThe question Kim refused to answerDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un appeared warm and pleasant before and after their private meeting — but there’s one question the North Korean dictator refused to answer.When the 38-minute meeting concluded, the leaders waved their hands and approached the deck where foreign journalists were waiting.Kim was reportedly asked three times about denuclearisation, but he smiled and said nothing according to the White House press pool.The North Korean leader was asked twice, “Chairman Kim, will you denuclearise?” and said nothing. The third unanswered question was: “Mr Kim, will you give up your nuclear weapons, sir?”He and Mr Trump walked away, ignoring questions that were shouted out to them.They then moved into the expanded meeting with their two interpreters and security details.Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was America’s main goal for the summit. Everything was dependent on the hermit nation’s willingness to denuclearise.Experts have argued the summit in itself is a win for North Korea, for the regime has long craved recognition and international status by meeting with a US leader.But according to the White House press pool, when Mr Trump was asked how the meeting went, he responded: “Very very good!”The President is expected to give details of the discussion in an address to the media this evening.1.30pmMenu for the working lunch revealedHere’s the menu for the working lunch, courtesy of the White House press pool:StartersTraditional prawn cocktail served with avocado saladGreen mango kerabu with honey lime dressing \u0026 fresh octopus“Oiseon” (Korean stuffed cucumber)Main courseBeef short rib confit, served with potato dauphinois and steam broccolini, red wine sauce on the sideCombination of sweet \u0026 sour crispy pork and Yangzhou Fried Rice with homemade XO chili sauce“Daegu jorim” (Soy Braised cod fish with Radish, Asian Vegetables)DessertsDark chocolate tartlet ganacheHaagendazs vanilla iced cream with cherry coulisTropezienneSounds delish.1.10pmWhy Kim arrived before TrumpKim Jong-un’s car pulled up to the summit at the Capella Hotel seven minutes before Donald Trump’s did.Here’s an interesting suggestion as to why, courtesy of the White House press pool: “According Korean media, Mr Kim actually arrived in summit venue 7 minutes earlier than Mr Trump to show respect, it’s cultural, the young one should arrive earlier than the elder one.”Mr Trump’s choice of tie colour may have held significance too, with the reporter suggesting it’s the colour North Koreans like best.12.30pmMoon Jae-in weighs in on summitSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has weighed in on the summit, saying he didn’t sleep the night before.“I too spent a sleepless night,” he said, according to the Korea Times. “I, along with all our people, sincerely hope that it will be a successful summit that will open a new era of complete denuclearisation, peace and a new relationship between South Korea, North Korea and the United States.”He said this is just the beginning of a “long process” to completely denuclearise the North and bring peace to the Korean peninsula.“The deep-rooted hostile relationship and the North Korean nuclear issue cannot be resolved in one single action in a meeting between leaders,” he said yesterday. “Even after the two leaders open the dialogue, we will need a long process that may take one year, two years or even longer to completely resolve the issues.”12.10pmTrump’s big vow to Kim after historic meetingDonald Trump has vowed to Kim Jong-un that they will solve a “big dilemma” together.After their private meeting, the leaders moved to a larger discussion with their advisers and interpreters present, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, White House chief of staff John Kelly and an interpreter.“It’s a great honour to be with you, and I know we’ll have tremendous success together,” Mr Trump told the North Korean leader across the table. “We’ll solve the big problem, the big dilemma, that until this point has been unable to be solved.“We will be successful. And I look forward to working on it with you. It will be done.”It’s likely Mr Trump was referring to the need to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.More details of this exchange are expected when he addresses the media at 6pm (AEST).Press have now left the room and an expanded working lunch will get under way.11.50pmPrivate meeting ends between Trump and Kim The one-on-one meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un finished after 38 minutes, according to the White House press pool.As they left, Mr Trump said the meeting was “very, very good” and that they have an “excellent relationship”, according to Associated Press.The pair smiled a few times as they walked along the breezeway.“Many people in the world will think of this as a ... form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,” Kim’s translator said at the end of the last breezeway walk, according to audio from CNN.11.40amDennis Rodman breaks down during interviewThe former NBA star burst into tears during a passionate live interview about the summit.Appearing on CNN in a “Make America Great Again” hat and sunglasses shortly after Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un exchanged greetings, Dennis Rodman became emotional when he was asked what it was like when he visited North Korea and returned home during the Obama administration.“Obama didn’t even give me the time of day,” he said. “I asked him — I said I have something to say from North Korea. He just brushed me off. But that didn’t deter me.“I kept going back ... I showed my loyalty to this country, and I said to everybody, ‘The door will open’.”READ THE FULL STORY HERE.11.20amTrump describes meeting as ‘tremendously successful’Mr Trump has described the meeting as “tremendously successful”, with the pair now seated together in front of the media.“We will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt,” the US President said.“The old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles on our way forward, but we overcame all of them and we are here today,” added Kim.The body language between the pair has been notably warm. Mr Trump gave Kim a thumbs up as he said “we overcame all”.They exchanged another handshake and touched each other on the arm.Both leaders have been openly smiling.11.05amKim and Trump meet face-to-faceIn a historic moment, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have met face-to-face for the first time, appearing before the media in front of the American and North Korean flags at the Capella Hotel in Singapore.At 9.04am, Mr Trump and Mr Kim approached from opposite sides of a white colonnade, shook hands and posed for photo. Kim could be heard saying “Nice to meet you, Mr President.”They then shook hands again and walked off stage together.The leaders are shortly expected to enter a meeting room one-on-one, accompanied solely by their translators, before moving into an expanded meeting later in the day.It is unknown how long the private meeting will last, but the White House schedule has given it roughly 45 minutes.The pair will begin a working lunch at 1.30pm (AEST) before Mr Trump addresses the media later this evening.11.00amKim and Trump arrive at summit siteKim Jong-un and Donald Trump have arrived at the summit site.The North Korean leader arrived first, got out of his vehicle and swiftly entered the Capella Hotel without smiling.Mr Trump arrived a few minutes later.10.45amLast-minute shock for TrumpJust minutes before his meeting with Kim Jong-un, Donald Trump tweeted that Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow has suffered a heart attack.The financial analyst, who currently serves under the US President, is now in Walter Reed Medical Centre.10.40amKim arrives at summit siteKim Jong-un has arrived at the Capella Hotel. The two leaders are now due to shake hands in 20 minutes — in what will be the first time in history a sitting US President has met with his North Korean counterpart.After meeting in front of the media for 15 minutes, they are expected to meet one-on-one, accompanied solely by their translators.According to CNN, a senior US official said the welcome will be “warm, polite, respectful” — but it’s unknown if Mr Trump will smile as he usually does when greeting world leaders.10.15amKim Jong-un is now on the moveKim Jong-un has just departed for the meeting.He will make the 30-minute drive from the St Regis Hotel to Sentosa Island to begin historic negotiations with the US President.10.00amDonald Trump has left his hotelDonald Trump has now departed the Shangri-La Hotel and is en route to meet Kim Jong-un for the historic summit.He is headed to the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island with a police escort accompanying him.Mr Trump and Mr Kim will appear before the media for the first time together in less than an hour.In light of this significant occasion, the president ... just tweeted this:9.45amTwo words to listen out for after summitDonald Trump has vowed not to use the term “maximum pressure” in the meeting with Kim Jong-un.In a joint press conference with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe last week, the US leader said his use of the term this evening would be an indicator of how well the meeting went.“Maximum pressure is absolutely in effect. We don’t use the term anymore because we’re going into a friendly negotiation,” he said. “Perhaps after that negotiation I will be using it again. You’ll know how well we do in the negotiation. If you hear me saying we’re going to use “maximum pressure,” you’ll know the negotiation did not do well, frankly. There’s no reason to say it.”Mr Trump has also claimed he will know within the “first minute” if Kim Jong-un is serious about giving up his nuclear arsenal.Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Canada last week, he said: “I think within the first minute, I’ll know.”“Just my touch, my feel, that’s what I do,” he said. “How long will it take to figure out if they’re serious? You know, the way they say you know if you’re going to like somebody in the first five seconds, you ever hear that one? I think very quickly I’ll know whether or not something good is going to happen.”9.30amMike Pompeo departs for summitSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been snapped on his way to the summit.Addressing the media in Singapore yesterday, Mr Pompeo said the meeting is “truly a mission of peace”.“North Korea has previously confirmed to us its willingness to denuclearise, and we are eager to see if those words prove sincere,” he said. “The fact that our two leaders are sitting down face-to-face is a sign of the enormous potential to accomplish something that will immensely benefit both of our peoples and the entire world.”He said he is “hopeful” the summit will “set the conditions for future productive talks”.Mr Pompeo will not be part of the initial meeting at 11.15am (AEST), which according to the White House will consist solely of Mr Trump, Mr Kim and their respective translators.8.45amTrump hits back at ‘haters and losers’Donald Trump has issued another tweet this morning — this time faulting the unnamed “haters and losers” who opposed the summit.He notes North Korea releasing a trio of US citizen hostages and halting missile tests after floating talks.Earlier this month, Kim Jong-un released three American hostages who had been held for months in the reclusive country. The move was considered a diplomatic gesture in the lead-up to the summit.In April Kim agreed to immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests.8.30amJulie Bishop weighs in on ‘unorthodox’ leadersAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop seems optimistic about the summit after speaking with Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.“I was in contact with Vivian last night and he confirmed that both leaders are very upbeat and positive about a potential breakthrough at this meeting,” she told Sunrise this morning. “So let’s hope the summit is a success and we do see real concrete genuine steps towards peace on the Korean peninsula.”Ms Bishop said she’s hopeful that after the “getting-to-know-you period”, the pair can sit down and work out details for a second meeting. “Our expectation should be that some progress will be made,” she said.She wouldn’t say whether the meeting made her nervous, but noted both leaders were “unorthodox” in their styles.8.15amDennis Rodman arrives for Trump-Kim summitFormer NBA star Dennis Rodman arrived in Singapore late yesterday ahead of the summit, saying he was “excited to be part of it”.“It should go fairly well, but people should not expect so much for the first time,” Rodman told reporters at the airport. “The doors are opening.”There has been no indication Rodman would be involved in any official talks at the summit, and last week, Mr Trump said he wasn’t invited to Singapore.Rodman is one of a handful of Westerners to have visited reclusive North Korea and met Mr Kim, who is believed to be a huge basketball fan and occasional player. The former basketballer has called the North Korean leader his “friend for life”.After his most recent five-day visit, he told reporters: “I’m just trying to open the door.”— Reuters8.00amKim’s sister spotted in SingaporeKim Yo-jong has been sighted in Singapore.The sister of the North Korean leader accompanied her brother to the historic summit, but reportedly flew in separately due to security concerns.In this video grab, she can be seen arriving before her brother’s tour of the Sands Sky Park at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.Ms Kim was the first member of North Korea’s ruling family to visit South Korea when she travelled to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February.7.30am‘Meetings going well and quickly’It’s 5.30am in Singapore, but US President Donald Trump is already up and tweeting.He just said everything seems to be running smoothly — with a touch of scepticism thrown in for good measure.7.20amNorth Koreans waking up to summit newsThis summit has been infiltrating your news feeds for weeks, but yesterday was the first time North Koreans heard their Supreme Leader had touched down in Singapore.According to CNN, crowds of North Koreans gathered outside a train station in Pyongyang to watch news of the summit broadcast onto a big screen, which included an update from famed North Korean news anchor Ri Chun Hee.“The historic first meeting and talks between the respected and beloved Comrade Supreme Leader and Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, will be held on the morning of June 12 in the Republic of Singapore,” she announced, in her trademark excited tone.She noted the summit was a “historical first” that is “garnering the attention and hopes of the entire world.”The announcement is a break from traditional coverage of Kim’s summits, which usually only reaches North Koreans after the meetings have ended.7.00amEye-watering cost of the summitPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told local media the total cost of the summit would be $S20 million ($A19.7 million). Yowza.Security:Mr Lee said half of the figure would be spent on security, although the total amount is difficult to determine as much of the security consists of existing personnel that have been deployed around-the-clock.The security requirements are much higher than for previous meetings, with Mr Lee noting it’s not just policemen but “all-round protection and in-depth protection — air, sea, land, against attack and against mishap”.Accommodation:The entire five-star Capella luxury resort has been booked for the event. The most basic room at the resort goes for $S695, with the most expensive booking at almost $S13,000 per night.Hundreds of other hotel rooms have been booked for the actual event, including at the Shangri La hotel where Mr Trump is staying, and the St Regis where Mr Kim will be. An average night at these hotels is around $S535. Throw in hundreds of rooms for cameramen, personal security guards … you do the maths.Media:Accommodating the estimated 2500 journalists will also bear a large brunt of the costs — about $S5 million, according to the Ministry of Communications and Information. Singapore has built an international media centre for the event from scratch at the F1 Pit Building, including a stage and 2000 workstations, and they are bringing in satellite trucks and cable networks for the summit.But it’s believed that the benefits will outweigh the costs. Mr Lee said it was a “whole of Singapore effort”, noting that while ordinary Singaporeans had had their lives “a little bit inconvenienced” due to road closures and traffic jams, it was a “national effort”.It wasn’t easy to find a suitable location for the meeting, partly due to the difficulty of finding a country that had diplomatic relations with both sides.“Therefore, when the two sides asked us to host the meeting, we cannot say no,” Mr Lee said. “We have to step up … We can do a good job.”Jump back to topDonald Trump and Kim Jong-un met face-to-face for the first time in a historic summit in Singapore, before attending a private meeting and a working lunch with their advisers. Mr Trump then addressed the media in an extraordinary question and answer session that lasted almost an hour, before the leaders departed.A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.Find out more about our policy and your choices, including how to opt-out.News Limited Copyright © 2018.

So how did we get here? US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived in Singapore on Sunday for an unprecedented summit, with Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal at the top of the agenda and the US president calling it a 'one-time shot' at peace.A YEAR ago, it would’ve been hard to imagine Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump were about to meet face-to-face.These were the days when we heard of “big buttons” rather than “big letters”, test missiles were being launched over Japan, and a much-parodied but alarming back-and-forth series of threats were being exchanged through Twitter and state media.Now we see Mr Kim and his South Korean counterpart hugging and laughing in public, a nuclear test site being demolished in the presence of invited foreign journalists, and the meeting of the century about to take place between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore.Here’s a look back on the major events that led up to this moment.***2016***NOVEMBER Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.***2017***JANUARYKim Jong-un warns that his country is making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.He also says North Korea will continue to bolster its weapons as long as the United States remains hostiles and continues its joint military exercises with South Korea.APRILMr Trump orders a missile strike on Syria and reports that the US would “prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons”.North Korea holds a massive parade to mark the 105th anniversary of Kim Il-sung — and to display what appears to be long-range and submarine-based missiles.JULYNorth Korea fires its first ever IBM over Japan, marking a sharp escalation in tensions over Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.Experts say the missile has a range of about 10,000 kilometres — far enough to strike the west coast of the US and beyond.Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull publicly condemns the threat, calling on all nations to impose their harshest sanctions on Pyongyang, while singling out China as the country with the most dire ability to do this.AUGUSTMr Trump threatens North Korea with “fire and fury” if it doesn’t stop threatening the US. Pyongyang responds by threatening to fire ballistic missiles near the US Pacific territory of Guam.Later North Korea fires a missile over Japan, which falls into the ocean.An emergency UN Security Council meeting is called over the incident, and the White House issues a strongly-worded statement calling on Pyongyang to suspend its arms programme.SEPTEMBERNorth Korea announces it has successfully conducted a nuclear bomb, before testing another missile launch over Japan.Mr Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping hold a meeting agreeing to “maximising pressure” on North Korea.Addressing the US General Assembly on September 19, he says the US “will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea” if it threatens America or its allies.He calls Mr Kim “Little Rocket Man”, and Pyongyang responds calling the President a “mentally deranged US dotard”.NOVEMBERNorth Korea broadcasts a special television announcements declaring its latest missile launch a success and claiming it’s “capable of striking the whole mainland of the US”.Mr Trump responds saying, “we’ll handle it”.***2018***JANUARYMr Trump tweets his infamous “Nuclear Button” post, warning that “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger \u0026 more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”Shortly after, North and South Korea launch rare talks to bring North Koreans to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.FEBRUARYKim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo-jong leads a delegation to attend the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.MARCHSouth Korea sends a delegation to speak with Mr Kim, who later extends an official invitation to Mr Trump to meet for talks, while agreeing to halt further nuclear and missile tests.Mr Trump confirms he will meet with Mr Kim, without specifying where or when.APRILMr Kim and Mr Moon meet for the first time in 11 years.The historic meeting marks the first time a North Korean leader has entered the South’s territory since the end of the Korean War.A peace declaration is made, and Mr Trump reaffirms that he is “looking forward” to the summit.MAYThe summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim is abruptly cancelled through an open letter, after a North Korean delegation threatened to renew nuclear testing.JUNEThe summit is declared back on, and officially scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Kim made no explicit undertakings to give up his nuclear program and gave no timeline for dismantling it. Meanwhile, the President made a massive concession in promising to suspend military exercises with South Korea in the region.Kim’s appalling human rights abuses and use of prison camps were skimmed over, and critics called Mr Trump “naive” and “outfoxed” following his excited rhetoric about what had been achieved.While there was no mention of when the US might lift sanctions against the hermit kingdom, the Singapore meeting looked like a step forward for Kim in gaining the world’s trust.The unprecedented meeting between a sitting US President and North Korean leader may have broken new symbolic ground — but it didn’t achieve anything tangible on its most vital aims: DENUCLEARISATIONThe primary goal of the meeting was to persuade Kim to stop the nation’s nuclear development and give up his nukes and ballistic missiles.The 34-year-old did none of this, simply vowing in the document to adhere to the promise he made to South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in at their April meeting.He “reaffirmed” the same commitment North Korea has been making since 1992, in a pledge that appeared weaker than 2005’s commitment to “abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.” The regime tested its first nuclear device the following year, has conducted five underground tests since and is thought to have assembled at least two dozen warheads.The US wanted complete verifiable irreversible denuclearisation (CVID), which would require North Korea to allow international inspections and monitoring of sites — but there was no mention of Pyongyang welcoming United Nations nuclear inspectors back.Experts on the region have long voiced doubts Kim will ever give up his weapons, suspecting he may simply try to prolong negotiations and gain a relaxation of international sanctions.Mr Trump said in his press briefing after the summit that he was particularly pleased Kim had verbally agreed to destroy a nuclear missile testing site. “It was really the engine-testing site in addition to all of the other things that they’ve agreed to do,” he said.The 71-year-old seemed to be referring to a test stand crucial to developing mid-range, solid-fuel missiles, which North Korea razed in the country’s northwest, as reported by 38 North last week.Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies emphasised that denuclearisation didn’t mean disarmament in North Korea’s eyes, but an initial step towards improving the relationship. “I didn’t lower my expectations quite far enough,” Mr Lewis told CNN. “I think the two parties are as far apart as they’ve ever been.”Olivia Enos, policy analyst at conservative Washington think tank the Heritage Foundation, told the Wall Street Journal the “incredibly vague” agreement did not bridge the gap between the two nations’ understanding of denuclearisation. “This seems like just another feel-good statement similar to the one signed at the inter-Korean dialogue with little to no meat on the bones of where we go from here,” she said. PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULAThe joint statement spoke of efforts “to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula,” but no immediate end was called to the decades-long war, a result it had been hinted could transpire.This was again a much weaker commitment than a 1994 pledge to exchange diplomatic liaison offices, and a 2005 pledge to work towards a peace treaty.Mr Trump said US military exercises with South Korea in the region were “provocative” and “inappropriate”, mirroring the language used by the North in its propaganda. The President promised to suspend the “tremendously expensive” exercises as long as productive talks continued, saying he would remove US troops from the South “at some point”. His vow appeared to take Mr Moon’s administration, US troops in Korea and even some in the Pentagon by surprise.Abraham Denmark from the Wilson Center in Washington said South Koreans would be “unnerved” and conservatives “apoplectic” over the decision.The South’s defence ministry said it was trying to determine the meaning of Mr Trump’s words, while a national security official said “nothing has changed.” A spokesman for US Forces Korea said it had received no new guidance on joint military manoeuvres, including drills planned for the autumn. US military officers in South Korea were reportedly confused about what would happen next, and whether training would be cancelled, while other Asian allies of the US were also said to be nonplussed.“The North Koreans did not come with anything new,” former CIA director Michael Hayden told CNN. “The new element is that we agreed to stop our annual exercise cycle with our South Korean allies. That’s actually a pretty significant concession.”Ian Bremmer, from the Eurasia Group, told CBS: “What we have is a freeze for freeze. The North Koreans are freezing their intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear tests and the Americans are freezing our military exercises with the South Koreans. That’s exactly the formation the Chinese asked for over the past year and we said absolutely not.” FRIENDSHIPSome suggested the greatest achievement of the summit was its symbolic step towards easing the stand-off between North Korea and the world.But others noted that it was Mr Trump himself who stoked tensions by calling Kim a “little rocket man” and swearing to “totally destroy” the reclusive state last year.When he showed his counterpart a mock movie trailer heralding “two men, two leaders, one destiny,” he flattered “Chairman Kim’s” ego and pandered to his desire to transform his image on the global stage.Mr Trump called the North Korean leader a “talented” man who “loves his country very much.”Asked how he squared this with Kim murdering family members, kidnapping civilians and abusing his own people, Mr Trump replied: “I believe it’s a rough situation over there, there’s no question about it. It’s rough in a lot of places, by the way.”He added: “Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough, I don’t say it was nice, he ran it — very few people at that age, you can take one out of 10,000 probably who couldn’t do it.”The US President said former prisoner Otto Warmbier “had not died in vain”, but added that the leaders had only discussed human rights “relatively briefly” because their talks focused on nuclear weapons.North Korea did commit to the “immediate repatriation” of any remains it had identified of US soldiers and prisoners of war — a not insignificant goodwill gesture — but no enough for many. THE BOTTOM LINEFor Mr Trump, the meeting was “fantastic”, “very positive”, “top of the line” and “really good.”Kim said the two leaders had overcome the “old prejudices and practices” that had been obstacles to moving forward.The US President said he was confident North Korea would start dismantling its nuclear arsenal “very quickly,” adding that economic sanctions would remain in place until it did.He told reporters in Singapore after the summit that talks would continue, and he would possibly invite Kim to the White House and visit Pyongyang “at the appropriate time.”“I do trust him, yeah,” the President told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America few hours after the meeting. “He really wants to do a great job for North Korea. He’s de-nuking the whole place, and I think he’s going to start very quickly. He really wants to do something I think terrific for their country.”However, while he said Kim would begin the process soon, Mr Trump simultaneously played down the possibility of rapid progress.““We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,” he said. “It does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearisation. It takes a long time. “Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen. But despite that, once you start the process, it means it’s pretty much over. Can’t use them, that’s the good news. That’s going to start very soon.”As Mr Trump said earlier: “I think he’s going to do these things. I may be wrong. I may stand before you in six months and say, ‘Hey, I was.’”But, he added: “I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that. I’ll find some kind of excuse.” emma.reynolds@news.com.au | @emmareynA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

The North Korean leader — who rarely travels — was surrounded by security guards, a media scrum and cheering crowds as he embarked on an evening tour of attractions on the city’s waterfront.Kim’s motorcade headed to the world-famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, before he and his sister Kim Yo-jong visited the Esplanade, Jubilee Bridge and the Gardens by the Bay, where the reclusive leader posed for selfies with Singaporean government officials.Mr Trump met with Mr Lee on Monday and attended a working lunch, telling the Singaporean PM: “We’ve got a very interesting meeting in particular tomorrow, and I think things can work out very nicely.”The US President was presented with an early birthday cake and blew out the candles ahead of his 72nd on June 14, before returning to the Shangri-La Hotel to work.The US delegation at the larger meeting on Tuesday will include Mr Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and National Security Advisor John Bolton.Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Ambassador Sung Kim, and National Security Council Senior Director for Asia Matt Pottinger will attend the working lunch.Former NBA star Dennis Rodman arrived in Singapore at around midnight, hours before Tuesday morning’s summit. The White House said he would play no official role in negotiations, but the athlete has promised to “give whatever support is needed” to his “friends” Mr Trump and Kim.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier seemed to play down expectations for the meeting, which Mr Trump had predicted could yield an instant end to the Korean War.Mr Trump called the leaders of South Korea and Japan in advance of the summit but South Korean President Moon Jae-in would have to be present if a declaration ending the conflict was to be signed, and he has no current plans to join Mr Trump and Kim.Mr Pompeo suggested the summit might have little concrete success other than to pave the way for further meetings.The Secretary of State told reporters the US was prepared to take action to provide North Korea with “sufficient certainty” that denuclearisation “is not something that ends badly for them.”He would not say whether that included the possibility of withdrawing troops from the Korean Peninsula, but stressed the discussions were “radically different than ever before”He said the US was “prepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique, than America’s been willing to provide previously.”Mr Trump has already made it clear the summit is a “one-time shot” and said he would know within minutes of meeting Kim whether an agreement was going to be reached or not. But he also said the summit would be part of a “process”.He told reporters he hadn’t prepared “very much” because, “I will know, just my touch, my feel. That’s what I do.”Asked on Saturday about his aims, he said: “Well, I think the minimum would be relationship. You would start at least a dialogue, because, you know, as a deal person, I have done very well with deals.”The North has faced crippling international sanctions as it has developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.There is deep scepticism over whether Kim will easily abandon his nuclear weapons program, but experts hope diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the Hermit Kingdom.With the summit already dramatically cancelled and reinstated, anything appears to be possible from this clash of two unpredictable men.Mr Trump also made an unexpected exit from the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, insulting host Justin Trudeau and removing the US from the group statement.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742bd64719c855c40cfd18"},"header":"Singapore scrambling to prepare for the dramatic Trump-Kim summit","time":"June 4, 20181:12pm","content":"THIS $8000 motel room is at the centre of a global circus ahead of the much talked about meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.The nuclear summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is back on again next month in Singapore after briefly being cancelled.THE peaceful city-state of Singapore is a whirlwind of activity ahead of the circus that will be Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un’s summit in less than two weeks.With the historic meeting abruptly cancelled and then rescheduled, frantic preparations are under way to book out hotels for around 3000 journalists, set up meeting places and organise tight security.Tourism workers, law enforcement and government officials of three countries are scrambling to prepare for the dramatic event. There are plans for extensive road closures and police will line the streets around the venue, expected to be the lavish Shangri-La or Marina Bay Sands hotels.Talking points, locations for photographs, catering and potential joint statements all have to be meticulously planned — the room must have two entrances, so both can enter at the same time. An inappropriate background or unsuitable gift could be disastrous for the tense talks between two men who only recently called each other “dotard” and “little rocket man” as they exchanged nuclear threats.Mr Kim is expected to use Soviet-era aircraft to carry him, staff, security and his limousine on his longest official journey, which will pose all kinds of challenges for the impoverished country.There has been intense negotiation over who will pay for the North Korean leader’s preferred $8000 room at the high-end Fullerton Hotel, with the United States, Singapore and an anti-nukes non-profit agreeing to contribute.Agreeing upon a satisfactory menu will be a tricky balance: the US President is known as a non-drinker who favours a reliable burger, even when visiting Asian countries. Mr Kim enjoys wine and brought Pyongyang cold noodles to an April 27 summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Restaurants and bars are treating the event as a tourism opportunity, with Escobar serving up a blue, bourbon-based cocktail named the “Trump” and a red “Kim” drink containing Korean spirit soju, as well as organising a “US-North Korea showdown” where customers who order a tray of 20 shots compete in a game of “rock, paper, scissors” while wearing gloves emblazoned with the countries’ flags.SPIES, SECRET SERVICE AND EXTERNAL THREATSThe North Korean leader was memorably pictured with 12 bodyguards running alongside his car when meeting his counterpart from the South. Even more extreme security measures are being put in place for the Trump talks, with both leaders known to be paranoid about their safety.A senior North Korean adviser was seen by reporters reading a briefing paper on a flight to Singapore that said, “in order to guarantee the results of the US-North Korea summit meeting, guarantee the safety of Chairman Kim Jong-un above all else”.The Secret Service, North Korean officials and Singaporean security teams are consulting to ensure the meeting between the erratic leaders goes to plan, with the discussion holding immense significance for global politics.Mr Trump has repeatedly implied he may have already spoken with Mr Kim, but it’s unclear if this is the case. The pair have met before.They are also working to prevent spies infiltrating with talks, with China and Russia both having an outside interest, Politico reports. The White House is currently planning a controversial potential summit between the US President and Vladimir Putin.Russia’s foreign minister on Thursday met with Mr Kim in Pyongyang and passed on Mr Putin’s “warmest regards and best wishes” for North Korea’s “big endeavours” on the Korean Peninsula, inviting the regime’s leader to visit Moscow.Mr Trump, who agreed to reinstate the meeting after a visit from North Korean envoy Kim Yong-chol with a large letter, will also discuss Syria, Ukraine and wider arms-control with his counterpart. On Sunday, North Korean state media reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plans to visit Mr Kim in Pyongyang. It would be the first meeting between Mr Kim and another head of state in the North Korean capital.Just as North Korea has angered the international community over its nuclear weapons program, Syria has been widely condemned for its brutality in the country’s civil war.United Nations monitors have accused the North of co-operating with Syria on chemical weapons, a charge it denies.Mr Assad praised the “outstanding political calibre and wise leadership of His Excellency Kim Jong-un” and said he was certain the North Korean leader would “achieve the final victory and realise the reunification of Korea without fail”.WHAT WILL THEY ACHIEVE?The summit itself is largely a symbolic gesture — but a hugely important one for diplomacy.Advance negotiations are already taking place to discuss whether North Korea will agree to the “complete verifiable irreversible disarmament (CVID)” that the US wants.Many think this unlikely, with Mr Kim making it clear he does not plan to give up his weapons and his aggressive rhetoric already caused the meeting to flounder, with Mr Trump showing how easily he could pull the plug.What North Korea does desperately need is an improvement in its economic fortunes. This is Mr Kim’s chance to persuade the US and other countries to engage in joint endeavours and end sanctions.Mr Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that the summit would be just “a beginning” in “a process” towards persuading the North to completely stop developing nuclear weapons. The Kim administration is expected to draw out the complex negotiations while it continues to develop those capabilities.Tufts University Korean Studies professor Sung-Yoon Lee told USA Today  Mr Kim may already have won just by agreeing to talk about nuclear weapons and buying himself “time and money”.She said the negotiations could undercut US efforts to persuade China and others into joining in sanctions on North Korea over its nukes, predicting a “political and economic bonanza” for the regime.There may also be progress on another front. Some experts say an end to the Korean War could come as soon as a day after the Trump-Kim summit, following a recent surge in talks between the North and South aimed at ending the decades-old conflict.The US President said a formal end to the war would be on the negotiating table at his meeting with Mr Kim. Seoul-based security expert Cho Sung Ryul told  The Korea Herald that the discussion would be more about symbolism than a decision with legal effect, but was necessary to ease North Korea’s concerns over security in the denuclearisation process until the current armistice agreement was replaced by a peace treaty.But the war of words has not ended. North Korea on Sunday again condemned South Korea’s upcoming military drills with the US, saying they were contrary to the agreement both countries signed at the April summit.Seoul plans to take part in the combined drills of the 20-nation Rim of the Pacific Exercise and Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which North Korea sees as a trial for invading its territory.“Dialogue and confrontation, and peace and war exercises can never go hand-in-hand,” read an editorial in North Korean official daily newspaper Rodong.Mr Kim also defied Washington when he complained of “US hegemonism” in a meeting with Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday.Whatever happens in eight days’ time, the summit marks a new era for North Korea after Mr Kim threw off the “Hermit Kingdom” legacy and embarked on a global diplomacy exercise in 2018. He had never even met another head of state until visiting Beijing in March.Now, two nations’ self-regarding leaders are at the centre of a remarkable moment — June 12 is set to be spectacular.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

The island’s name means “peace and tranquillity” and as it’s only accessible via one bridge linking it to the mainland, it’s also secluded and private — making it an ideal spot for US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s historic June 12 summit. But until a few decades ago, the island went by a different name, Pulau Belakang Mati — which roughly translates to “island of death from behind”. And that gives some indication of this carefree island’s dark past. One theory suggests the old name derived from Sentosa’s former association with piracy, as the 500-hectare tropical island was reportedly a popular pirates’ hideaway. Another theory taps into legends of the spirit world. “[The theory] speaks of the island being the ‘paradise’ of ‘warrior spirits’ whose bodies were entombed at [nearby island] Pulau Brani,” the National Library Board of Singapore said. But the ominous name could also refer to a deadly disease that swept the island in the late 1840s and came close to wiping out the entire population. The island’s association with death and bloodshed didn’t end there — it also had a big, and horrific, role in World War II. After the surrender of Singapore to Japanese forces in 1942, Sentosa was turned into a brutal camp for Australian and British prisoners of war. It was also a killing field for Singaporean Chinese people who, during the Japanese occupation, were accused of anti-Japanese activities and executed. The accused, mostly civilians, were rounded up on a two-kilometre beach — now a massive golf course — and shot dead, with their bodies hurled into the sea. About 300 corpses washed ashore during the Japanese occupation, the Straits Times reported. Fort Siloso, a major attraction on Sentosa, was used during the war to guard against approaches to Singapore. Its guns, ammunition bunkers and tunnels are on display, along with Singapore’s biggest collection of WWII memorabilia. Things changed during the 1970s when the Singaporean government developed the island as a tourist destination — and gave it its current, more visitor-friendly name. Far from the violence of its past, the island began to be synonymous with outdoor leisure, shopping and luxury, and as well as being a tourism powerhouse, it’s also home to some of Singapore’s richest people, with waterfront villas priced at up to $39 million. It also has 17 hotels, two golf courses, a three-kilometre beach lined with palm trees, an award-winning and a bunch of major attractions — Universal Studios Singapore, a Madame Tussauds museum, a water theme park, a nature park and massive shopping meccas.Next week’s summit — the first sitting between the leaders of the US and North Korea — will be held at the luxury, five-star Capella hotel, a sprawling, opulent complex that’s a favourite with A-list celebrities, and where the most lavish rooms cost close to $10,000 for a night. The hotel, which incorporates two colonial buildings that housed British officers in the 1880s, is known for its luxury amenities, impeccable service and privacy, according to the Associated Press. It’s been given a fresh coat of paint and had red carpets rolled in ahead of the historic summit.

So how did it report on the most significant meeting of Mr Kim’s life?  HOW NORTH KOREA COVERED THE SUMMITKCNA’s coverage of the historic meeting between the American and North Korean leaders was uncharacteristically warm.“Noting that he is pleased to sit face-to-face with President Trump and the U.S. side’s delegation, Chairman Kim Jong Un highly praised the president’s will and enthusiasm to resolve matters in a realistic way through dialogue and negotiations, away from the hostility-woven past,” the hermit nation’s state media report said.It repeatedly referred to them as \"the two top leaders”, and notes that after the working lunch, the “top leaders had a walk, deepening friendly feelings”.“Chairman Kim Jong Un and President Trump expressed expectation and belief that the two countries which have lived in the quagmire of hostility, distrust and hatred would pass the unhappy past over and dynamically advance toward an excellent and proud future beneficial to each other and another new era, the era of the DPRK-U.S. cooperation would open up.” BIG DETAIL MISSING FROM REPORTSThe denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula was the main end goal for the United States in meeting with Kim Jong-un.But the KCNA report made just two fleeting references to it — neither of which included a direct pledge to actually do so.The first reference states: “Kim Jong Un said in order to achieve peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and realise its denuclearisation, the two countries should commit themselves to refraining from antagonising with each other out of mutual understanding, and take legal and institutional steps to guarantee it.”The second states: “Kim Jong Un and Trump had the shared recognition to the effect that it is important to abide by the principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action in achieving peace, stability and denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.”Neither of these statements suggests the two leaders reached a concrete agreement that will ensure North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.Rather, it says the two countries should maintain a peaceful relationship if the prospect of denuclearisation is ever to be realised.In a separate report, KCNA acknowledges the joint text signed by the two leaders, which specifies four key agreements between the US and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).Again, this doesn’t actually specify a concrete plan for denuclearisation, but rather just reiterates a symbolic deal established between North and South Korea in April.Here’s what the document said — and a brief explanation of what each point means: 1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new US-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the people of the two counties for peace and prosperity.This serves as an acknowledgment that the US and North Korea are seeking to leave their hostilities behind and move towards peace. 2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.Until now, the US and South Korea have had an alliance against North Korea and its nuclear regime. This means the US and North Korea will move towards dialogue and pursue an end to their hostile relationship. 3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.The Panmunjom Declaration was adopted by North and South Korea during the 2018 inter-Korean Summit in April. It stated that the two sides would agree to work together to end the Korean War and bring about a new era of peace, including denuclearisation. This point serves as a reiteration of that. 4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.The United States and North Korea will work together to identify the remains of American Korean War casualties — a move veterans advocates have been pushing for. Over 7000 American service members from the war remain unaccounted for.A third KCNA article acknowledges Mr Kim received a letter from Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.The letter congratulated the leader for the “successful conclusion of the historic summit meeting” and said Singapore believed it was an “honour” to sponsor him and Mr Trump.Mr Lee also wrote that he hopes to meet Mr Kim again in the near future.

So we look nice and handsome and thin, and perfect.”The comment was translated for Kim and the camera zoomed in just in time to catch the North Korean leader looking shocked, then appalled.Mr Trump may simply have been feeling jovial, but Kim appeared to take this as a gibe about his weight.Viewers called Kim’s unamused expression “hilarious” and compared the reaction shot to a political satire or scene from The Office.Many wondered whether the “fat joke” directed at the notoriously aggressive leader would derail the entire encounter, since Kim is not known for his tolerance. But the pair later released an amiable joint statement after the historic summit, and were seen warmly bidding each other goodbye.Some questioned whether the good humour had been lost in translation, although Kim is believed to be a capable English speaker.The US President has previously said of the 34-year-old: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”Kim said to be sensitive about his weight and was infuriated by 2014 reports that he had broken his ankles after ballooning to 130 kilograms by eating too much Swiss cheese.Both leaders are exceptionally conscious of appearance, with Mr Trump suspected of pretending he is taller than he really is to avoid being classified as “obese” on the Body Mass Index.The comparisons didn’t stop at The Office, with one Twitter user placing the theme song from Curb Your Enthusiasm over the top for dramatic effect:The 71-year-old’s doctor’s letter claims he is 6’3” and 108kg, placing him just under the “obese” category. But questions were raised after photos of the G7 leaders standing in a row showed Mr Trump was a fraction shorter than Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is 6’2”.Kim also tried to boost his stature by wearing his custom Cuban heels, which have a secret stack to give the illusion the 5’7” leader is not significantly shorter than his counterparts.Before their attempt at improving relations with the Singapore meeting, Kim called Mr Trump a “dotard” and the President retorted that he was “little rocket man”. While they now seem to have reached a tentative truce, they walk a fine line between exchanging wild insults and achieving real peace.But with the promise of more meetings to come, we can only wait to see if there are more explosive moments between these hot-headed men.Trump, Kim Exchange Praise at Singapore SummitA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742c084719c855c40cfd22"},"header":" The Trump-Kim summit: When in Singapore, go sightseeing  ","time":"Monday, 20 August 2018","content":" What does a dictator who's been hemmed in at home do on his biggest trip abroad in years? Sightsee, of course. That's exactly what Kim Jong Un did, just 12 hours before his scheduled sit-down with US President Donald Trump this afternoon to discuss his nuclear programme and the prospect of officially ending the Korean War. The Singaporean hosts seemed to be daring Kim to think big, to dream of the kind of glittering future his country could have if it opens up to the outside world, as they took him on the late-evening tour. The outing was in stark contrast to Trump's itinerary. The President went to the US Embassy after having lunch with Singapore's Prime Minister and was not seen again for the rest of the day. But soon after 9 pm local time (1am NZT), Kim headed out of his five-star hotel and set out first for Gardens by the Bay, a huge open space on Singapore's waterfront with striking Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories. There, Singapore's Foreign Minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, took a selfie with Kim and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung in front of a wall of flowers. Kim, in the middle, was smiling and looking directly into the camera. \"Jalanjalan,\" Balakrishnan wrote on Twitter, using the Malay term for going for a walk. Then the group crossed over Jubilee Bridge, an architecturally impressive pedestrian walkway over the Singapore River, to Marina Bay Sands, a breathtaking building comprising three towers with an enormous boat-shaped structure on the top. The hotel and casino complex is owned by Las Vegas Sands, the company run by Sheldon Adelson, one of Trump's biggest donors. Kim smiled and waved at the crowd gathered at the entrance to Marina Bay Sands, some of whom cheered and clapped for him. The North Korean leader was accompanied by his sister and close aide, Kim Yo Jong, as well as cameramen for North Korea's state television channel, suggesting that his city tour will be featured on North Korea's news broadcasts. Guests at the Cé La Vi bar on the Marina Bay Sands' tiered 57th floor realised something was up soon after 8 pm, when the deck on the level below was cleared and the area secured. Around 9.30 pm, in swept about 50 bodyguards, according to staff, with Kim in the middle. He stood on the 56th floor's rooftop \"Sky Park\" looking over the city, with its skyscrapers topped by illuminated Citibank and HSBC signs. Kim was there for about 10 minutes, according to staff and patrons. \"I wondered why he was here. Doesn't he have a meeting in the morning?\" asked a British businessman drinking beer on the edge of the roof deck, the perfect spot to watch Kim on his tour. The staff weren't told who was coming to the bar, but they guessed. It was \"scary,\" said one. After Kim and his entourage left, cleaners wiped away fingerprints from the glass barriers, according to local reports. Singapore is a comfortable place for North Koreans. It is in Asia, and it has been ruled by one family for almost 60 years. It has strict rules, although nowhere near as strict as North Korea's. And its astonishing economic transformation offers a model for a strong developing state. Because the island nation is so relatable, the Singaporean nongovernmental organisation Choson Exchange has brought more than 100 North Koreans here over the past nine years, teaching them about finance and market economics and development. \"Bringing North Koreans to Singapore is about telling them that if they take the right steps, someday they will be a prosperous global city, too,\" said Geoffrey See, the Singaporean who started Choson Exchange. \"And this economic story is reflected in the infrastructure in the bay area, with the skyscrapers lining the business district, the Marina Bay Sands hotel crowning the skyline and the Esplanade flanking the bay.\" In fact, See has taken his North Korean groups on almost exactly the same city tour that Kim undertook, although - unlike Kim - the other North Koreans stopped for a drink beside the infinity pool atop the Marina Bay Sands boat. Singapore's Government appeared to be sending a signal to Kim about the possibilities for his own future, See said. \"I would not be surprised that part of the message the U.S. has for North Korea in bringing them here is to say, 'If you take the right steps tomorrow, this could be the global prosperous city or country you can be in a generation,' \" he said.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12068829","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:06:49.143Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742c134719c855c40cfd26"},"header":" Why Trump was among the winners at the Singapore summit  ","time":"Monday, 20 August 2018","content":" In the hours after the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, experts and pundits on social media have mostly opined that the US 'got nothing' out of the meeting. An obvious case can be made for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his patron China as the chief winners. The concessions on US side were easy to see: - The US 'normalised' and 'legitimised' Kim by presenting him as an equal to President Donald Trump on the world stage. The twined flag arrangement, the handshake choreography in the meet and greet were no different to how a US president would treat a typical visiting foreign leader at the White House. The pair held talks with aides, a working lunch and signed a declaration at the end. Yet Kim is the dictator of a tightly-controlled, and until recently isolated, rogue nation - now with nukes. - The US dialled back on its demand for a show of faith from North Korea on its nuclear programme, with no timetable now given for disarmament and just a vague goal of denuclerisation. To North Korea that term includes the US lifting its security blanket from the peninsula. - And Trump spoke afterwards about wanting to remove all US troops from South Korea. He also agreed to halt US-South Korea military drills, following the Chinese plan of a 'freeze for a freeze' after North Korea halted its nuclear and missile testing. - After just a day of meetings, Trump spoke of his \"trust\" in Kim and \"very special bond\" with the North Korean leader. Political analyst Josh Rogin tweeted: \"The more Trump talks about the deal, the worse it sounds. US stops exercises, pledges to remove troops, no new sanctions, all in exchange for vague promises of denuclearisation.\" Colin Kahl, former national security advisor to Joe Biden, tweeted: \"Critics of the Iran deal blasted Obama for giving up maximum leverage for a less-than-perfect agreement, even though the 156-page deal provided long-term, verifiable nuclear constraints. Trump has now given up maximum pressure on North Korea for 1 page of empty promises.\" The Atlantic Council's Daniel Fried wrote: \"China and Kim are winners. We are now operating within their policy framework: de facto nuclear status quo (which favours North Korea), suspension of US military exercises (ditto) , and de facto gradual weakening of sanctions, the leverage which the US administration deployed, developed, and now risks squandering.\" What this means for the US, North Korea and countries in the region is uncertain for now. There will be pushback from South Korea, the Pentagon and within the Republican Party over the pledges to stop military exercises and pullout troops. It is hard to see any troop withdrawal happening in this Trump term with the upcoming US election timetable of the Midterms in November and presidential campaigning next year. The unusual move to hold a summit with a despot, freshly part of the nuclear club, has instantly created precedents. Trump has even promised to invite Kim to the White House. But despite the disgust at 'normalisation,' regular talks and ties with North Korea appear to be a healthier and safer option than keeping the country at arms' length. It's a process that has to happen if the country is to evolve towards 'normality'. The question of what Trump's foreign policy is doing to the old system of diplomatic alliances in North America, Europe and Asia has been in sharp focus since the G7. As a businessman he seems to see little difference between old friends and foes, calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \"dishonest and weak\" just days before Kim was apparently \"very talented\". There's no consistency of position, just a whiplash of shifting stances. Fried writes: \"Tactical unpredictability can be a tool. Strategic unreliability is a liability.\" Rivals Russia and China gain more from Trump than the EU countries and Japan. The past counts for nothing. Fried adds: \"The administration can make up some of the losses by negotiating a serious framework for \"complete, verifiable, and irreversible\" North Korean disarmament, maintaining the sanctions in place and enforced until that deal is done and implemented, and postponing until after peace on the peninsula is secured any substantial change to the robust US-South Korea security relationship.\" For now, the US has diplomatic headaches with regional allies emerging from the summit. And for Trump himself? Trump said he told Kim: \"You can have the best hotels in the world. Think of it from a real estate perspective.\" A future Trump Tower Pyongyang? Once again he showed with his showmanship how difficult an opponent he will be in the next presidential election, with his added advantages of incumbency and a well-performing economy. He is an effective, easy-to-digest messenger who can charm when he wants to. He is trying to sell Kim and North Korea to his domestic audience. A CNN poll last month showed 77 per cent approval for the Trump-Kim meeting. It gives him a chance to reach beyond core supporters. People want a 'normal,' unthreatening North Korea. For people who don't chase the nuance in such events and absorb them via video, photos and soundbites, the summit may have looked like a bold move that paid off for Trump. It may have looked like a win, a foreign policy achievement for the dealmaker, something that no president had done before - as Trump made sure to emphasise.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12069630","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:07:52.163Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742c554719c855c40cfd2e"},"header":" Isolated Kim takes big gamble leaving home for Trump summit  ","time":"Monday, 20 August 2018","content":" SINGAPORE (AP) — Spare a moment, as you anticipate one of the most unusual summits in modern history, to consider North Korea's leader as he left the all-encompassing bubble of his locked-down stronghold of Pyongyang on Sunday and stepped off a jet onto Singapore soil for his planned sit-down with President Donald Trump on Tuesday. There's just no recent precedent for the gamble Kim Jong Un is taking. As far as we know, his despot father only traveled out of the country by train, and rarely at that, because of fears of assassination. Kim, up until his recent high-profile summit with South Korea's president on the southern side of their shared border, has usually hunkered down behind his vast propaganda and security services, or made short trips to autocrat-friendly China. While Singapore has authoritarian leanings, it is still a thriving bastion of capitalism and wealth, and Kim will be performing his high-stakes diplomatic tight-rope walk in front of 3,000 international journalists, including a huge contingent from the ultra-aggressive South Korean press — sometimes referred to by Pyongyang as \"reptile media\" — two of whom were arrested by Singapore police investigating a report of trespassing at the residence of the North Korean ambassador. While he famously attended school in Switzerland, traveling this far as supreme leader is an entirely different matter for someone used to being the most revered, most protected, most deferred to human in his country of 25 million. Kim is, essentially, upsetting two decades of carefully choreographed North Korean statecraft and stepping into the unknown. There's wild speculation about how Kim will perform on the world stage, although one question was answered Sunday: His grim-faced, well-muscled bodyguards marched alongside his armored limousine at one point in Singapore, just as they did when he met the South Korean leader in April. But amid the curiosity is an even more fundamental question: Why is he taking this risk at all? Here's a look: ___ THE LOGISTICS First the nuts and bolts: How do you protect what many North Koreans consider their single most precious resource, the third member of the Kim family to rule and a direct descendant of North Korea's worshipped founder Kim Il Sung? Hundreds of North Korean security experts have no doubt been up nights wondering how to safeguard Kim Jong Un since Trump shocked the world by accepting the North's invitation to meet. Kim arrived Sunday on a Chinese plane, not his official plane, which is called \"Chammae-1\" and named after the goshawk, North Korea's national bird. Kim may have shipped over the massive bulletproof and fireproof limousine that became a social media sensation when Kim was shown being driven across the border between the Koreas during his first summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in April, with a dozen staunch bodyguards encircling the auto. He could be seen speeding through Singapore on Sunday in a black limousine adorned with large North Korean flags. Singapore's The Straits Times reported earlier this month that the Singapore government declared that four black BMW sedans with armored bodies that can withstand gunshots, explosives and grenades were exempt from certain traffic rules through June 30. The newspaper said the vehicles weren't from a local authorized dealer, which suggests the cars were brought in specifically for the summit and may be used by Kim. Kim's bodyguards traveled with him, providing trusted protection to back up local Singapore security who were controlling the perimeter and crowds, One benefit of Singapore from the North Korean point of view is that there will probably not be any anti-North Korea protests during Kim's stay. \"Singapore is like a police state. How can such rallies take place there? Anyone involved in rallies would be arrested,\" said Choi Kang, vice president of Seoul's Asan Institute for Policy Studies. Kim arrived Sunday at the St. Regis hotel, where his close aide has been based as he leads a North Korean advance team arranging security and logistics details. South Korea's Hankook Ilbo reported that Singapore recommended the St. Regis, which hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping during his 2015 summit with Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, because it can be easily secured. ___ WHY'S HE TAKING THE RISK? The short answer might be that, despite his safety worries, Kim could end up getting much more out of this summit than he will have to give up. The standard thinking goes that he needs quick help to stabilize and then rebuild an economy that has suffered amid a decades-long pursuit of nuclear bombs, and that the North Koreans see a unique chance to win concessions, legitimacy and protection from a meeting with a highly unconventional U.S. president who's willing to consider options past American leaders would not. Kim also gets an \"obvious and immediate win\" by simply meeting with Trump, writes Joseph Yun, who was the top U.S. diplomat on North Korea until March. It's \"a sign of recognition that the North Koreans have sought for decades. In my meetings with North Korea's foreign ministry, its officials have repeatedly emphasized that only a leader-to-leader dialogue could break the nuclear impasse. At the root of this desire lies their central concern: regime survival,\" he wrote. The summit has been portrayed as a \"get to know you\" meeting. \"That's a perfect deal for North Korea. They pocket all of it and lose essentially nothing,\" said Christopher Hill, President George W. Bush's lead nuclear negotiator with the North. \"The North Koreans have already gotten what they need out of this. Their only issue is how much they have to give up. From what I can tell from (Trump's recent comments at the White House), they're not going to be asked to do much.\" Kim may also be seeing the gamble in a light never considered by his autocratic father and grandfather because of \"his determination to modernize North Korea,\" according to Ryan Haas, an Asia expert at the John L. Thornton China Center. \"Kim confronts rising expectations from within at the same time that he contends with ever-tightening sanctions from abroad,\" Haas wrote. \"So, according to this logic, in order to satisfy internal expectations, he will need to reduce external pressure, and this dynamic could push Kim down the path of denuclearization.\" Haas offers a useful warning, though, as people around the world settle in to watch the show in Singapore: \"Virtually no North Korea analyst inside or outside of the U.S. government\" expects Kim to actually give up his nukes. ___ Associated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung and Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report. ___ Foster Klug is AP's bureau chief in South Korea and has covered the Koreas since 2005.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742c624719c855c40cfd32"},"header":" Trump, Kim converge on Singapore ahead of high-stakes summit  ","time":"Monday, 20 August 2018","content":" US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un converged on this island city-state yesterday ahead of one of the most unusual and highly anticipated summits in recent world history, a sit-down meant to settle a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. Trump descended from Air Force One into the steamy Singapore night, greeting officials and declaring he felt \"very good,\" before he was whisked away to his hotel, driving along a route lined with police and photo-snapping onlookers. Trump travelled to Singapore from Canada, where he met with other world leaders whose countries make up the Group of Seven. Hours earlier, a jet carrying Kim landed. After shaking hands with the Singapore foreign minister, Kim sped through the streets in a limousine, two large North Korean flags fluttering on the hood, surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows and bound for the luxurious and closely guarded St. Regis Hotel. He and Trump are set to meet tomorrow morning in the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting US president. The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Kim smiled broadly last night as he met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. \"The entire world is watching the historic summit between (North Korea) and the United States of America, and thanks to your sincere efforts ... we were able to complete the preparations for the historic summit,\" Kim told Lee through an interpreter. Trump is set to meet with Lee today. Trump has said he hopes to make a legacy-defining deal for the North to give up its nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting. The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep scepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the North. US and North Korean officials are set to meet today in Singapore to make final preparations for tomorrow's meeting. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Sung Kim, the US ambassador to the Philippines who has taken the lead on policy negotiations with the North, will hold a \"working group\" with a North Korean delegation. The North Korean autocrat's every move will be followed by 3000 journalists who have converged on Singapore, and by gawkers around the world, up until he shakes hands with Trump tomorrow. It's a reflection of the intense global curiosity over Kim's sudden turn to diplomacy in recent months after a slew of North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year raised serious fears of war. Part of the interest in tomorrow's summit is simply because Kim has had limited appearances on the world stage. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his father's death in late 2011 — traveling twice to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarised Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea, respectively. But it's Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons that gives his meeting with Trump such high stakes. The meeting was initially meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-you session. Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty. It's unclear what Trump and Kim might decide tomorrow. Pyongyang has said it is willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with reliable security assurances and other benefits. But many say this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and given that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to his holding onto unchecked power. Any nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea's willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country's warheads and nuclear fuel, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea's reluctance to open its doors to outsiders. Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea. The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, but the war technically continues today because instead of a difficult-to-negotiate peace treaty, military officers for the US-led United Nations, North Korea and China signed an armistice that halted the fighting. The North may see a treaty — and its presumed safety assurances from Washington — as its best way of preserving the Kim family dynasty. The ensuing recognition as a \"normal country\" could then allow sanctions relief, and later international aid and investment. Just meeting with Trump will also give Kim a recognition North Korea has long sought, setting him up as global player and the leader of a country worthy of respect. - AP","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12068085","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:09:42.212Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

It started when Trump flew off in a huff (which is what keeps that hairstyle in place) from the G-7minus1 group selfie in Canada, and landed early in Singapore. Since it is sacrosanct to arrive on time in Singapore, he was immediately fined. It was a watershed moment.Kim said his plane came first. His limo came to the Capella hotel first (seven minutes earlier!). The sun even rises first in North Korea.Trump travelled with a hundred-odd limos and planes. Kim travelled with his own loo (beat that, America!) which he took back to Pyongyang. The summit will now be called KimTrumps.The diplomats were in a frenzy. The peace talks followed days of dithering and blathering, with Trump calling Kim belligerent (which translated into Korean as belly-lint) and Kim calling Trump old, and Trump calling Kim short and fat, and Trump calling Trudeau fake-faced, for good measure. After this, they issued joint statements that their countries cared not for body images (Miss America scrapped the swimsuit round at once to prove it); they cared instead for haircuts.The barbers were in a frenzy. The salons in Singapore had queues lined up outside them, with demands for the Kim katora-cut or the Trump buffoon (bouffant, we’ve been corrected).Singaporeans were in a frenzy. They were lining up the Pie (freeway, not free pie) to take selfies. With black cars. With Kim’s running bodyguards. With Trump’s retinue of Dwayne Johnsons. No one seemed to know why — there was a queue and so they were morally obliged to join it.South Korea was in a frenzy. After the summit, Trump said he would stop playing games in the sea with them. What’s more, Trump called Kim talented and said they had a special bond which was… (who cares about the in-between text?)… big and dangerous for the world.The translators were in a frenzy. How does one convey the criticality of not overdoing daegu jorem, dauphinois, oiseon or tropézienne? (And that was only the lunch menu).The analysts were in a frenzy. There were seven handshakes (lucky!). The first handshake lasted 13 seconds (unlucky!). Trump held Kim’s arm (his arm!) above the elbow — surely that meant more than below the knuckle? Trump held out his hand first. Kim smiled first. Trump wore a red tie. Kim wore elevated heels. Trump was still 20 cm taller than Kim. North Korean bodyguards checked the pen with which Kim signed the summit (no trust, no trust! Bad omen!).But what of the actual talks? The two leaders spent a long time comparing buttons. Trump went on record saying his was bigger than Kim’s. At 13.41 (nine is a lucky number!), they signed an agreement with four bullets (bullets?! — bad news!) Kim promised to disarm. Trump promised him a Big Mac.As the frenzy died down, there was only one thing that mattered and Lennon said it first: ‘Give peace a chance.’ Where Jane De Suza, the author of Happily Never After, talks about the week’s quirks, quacks and hacksSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 20, 2018 12:41:46 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-closer-look-at-the-trump-kim-summit-in-singapore/article24171431.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-closer-look-at-the-trump-kim-summit-in-singapore/article24171431.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:11:52.264Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

Restaurants are marking the city-state’s time in the global spotlight with everything from red, white and blue cocktails to tacos named after the two leaders. Several of the stunts are being marketed with a twist on Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” slogan. At Harmony Nasi Lemak in central Singapore a signboard with drawings of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim greets passers-by with the words- “Let’s make HARMONY great again!” Inside it’s selling what it calls the “Trump-Kim Chi Nasi Lemak,” which puts American and Korean elements in a traditional dish of rice, fish or chicken and chili paste that is popular in Singapore and neighboring Malaysia. The new dish features U.S. dry-aged beef and a stack of spicy kimchi, a Korean staple. Zach Wen, the restaurant’s co-founder, said the dish isn’t just a gimmick and he hopes it spreads a positive message. He noted that it’s already been well received. “Some Korean people who came ... love the kimchi a lot and others [are] saying that the portion is so huge. Why so big? I say because it’s the American version, it’s the American portion,” he said. At the Mexican restaurant Lucha Loco, they’re promising to “make tacos great again” by selling specialty tacos by the name of “El Gringo,” which in Spanish means the foreigner, and “El Hombre Cohete,” which translates as the rocket man. The former has the flavors of an American cheeseburger, while the latter is packed with Korean fried chicken. Executive chef Nelson Burgos said the restaurant is also offering customers the chance to smash piũatas shaped as caricatures of the two leaders that are filled with sweets. It’s “a gesture of celebration for us and for having such a big event in Singapore,” he said. “It’s an event that’s probably never going to happen again in our lifetimes.” Meanwhile, at the nightspot Escobar, they’re offering specialty summit cocktails. The “Trump” is a layered bourbon-based drink in the colors of the American flag. The “Kim” is deep red and shaken with soju, a vodka-like alcohol loved in both Koreas. Owner Stan Sri Ganesh was pleased that so many establishments were coming up with commemorative food and drinks. “I think it reflects well on Singapore that we’re not all that quiet,” he said. “We can be very colorful if we want to.

In the DMZ, the US Ambassador’s delegation continues diplomatic negotiations with the North Korean delegation.

Responding to a question on “maximum pressure” policy on North Korea, the press secretary said the US policy towards Pyongyang has not changed. “Our policy hasn’t changed.

Mr. Trump flew into Singapore’s Paya Lebar Air Base aboard Air Force One looking to strike a deal that will lead to the denuclearisation of one of America’s bitterest foes.After stepping down from Air Force One on a steamy tropical night, Mr. Trump was greeted by Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.Asked by a reporter how he felt about the summit, Mr. Trump said: “Very good”. He then got into his limousine for the drive to his hotel in central Singapore.North Korea’s Kim landed in Singapore earlier on Sunday.When the two meet on Tuesday at Sentosa, a resort island off Singapore’s port with a Universal Studios theme park and man-made beaches, they will be making history. Enemies since the 1950-53 Korean War, leaders of North Korea and the United States have never met previously — or even spoken on the telephone.Mr. Kim arrived at Singapore’s Changi Airport after his longest trip overseas as head of state, wearing his trademark dark “Mao suit” and distinctive high cut hairstyle. Arriving on a plane loaned by China, he was also greeted by Mr. Balakrishnan.Travelling with Mr. Kim were top officials including Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho and Kim Yong-chol, a close aide of Mr. Kim who has been instrumental in the diplomacy that culminates in Tuesday’s summit.Kim Yo-jong, Mr. Kim’s younger sister, was also spotted in his delegation. She emerged as an influential figure in Pyongyang’s opaque leadership in February, when she led a North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea.Officials who arrived with Mr. Trump include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.Mr. Trump, speaking in Canada on Saturday, said any agreement at the summit would be “spur of the moment”, underscoring the uncertain outcome of what he called a “mission of peace”.Senior U.S. officials, echoing what Mr. Trump has said in recent days, said that at a minimum they would like the summit to serve as a start of a dialogue with North Korea.Mr. Kim met Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shortly after his arrival, driving from the St. Regis Hotel where he is staying, through the famous Orchard Road shopping district, which was closed off for his tightly guarded motorcade.In his first public comments since arriving, Mr. Kim said Singapore’s role would be recorded in history if the summit was a success. Mr. Trump, who is staying at the Shangri-La Hotel, is due to meet Mr. Lee on Monday.The two leaders meet at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Tuesday at the Capella on Sentosa island, a refurbished British Army artillery mess that is one of Singapore’s most expensive hotels. A source involved in the planning of Mr. Kim’s trip said he was scheduled to leave Singapore at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Mr. Trump is scheduled to leave on Wednesday.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 20, 2018 12:43:20 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-arrives-in-singapore-ahead-of-unprecedented-us-north-korea-summit/article24128887.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-arrives-in-singapore-ahead-of-unprecedented-us-north-korea-summit/article24128887.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:13:25.133Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

Restaurants are marking the city-state’s time in the global spotlight with everything from red, white and blue cocktails to tacos named after the two leaders. Several of the stunts are being marketed with a twist on Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” slogan.At Harmony Nasi Lemak in central Singapore a signboard with drawings of Trump and Kim greets passers-by with the words: “Let’s make HARMONY great again!” Inside it’s selling what it calls the “Trump-Kim Chi Nasi Lemak,” which puts American and Korean elements in a traditional dish of rice, fish or chicken and chili paste that is popular in Singapore and neighboring Malaysia. The new dish features US dry-aged beef and a stack of spicy kimchi, a Korean staple.Zach Wen, the restaurant’s co-founder, said the dish isn’t just a gimmick and he hopes it spreads a positive message. He noted that it’s already been well received. “Some Korean people who came … love the kimchi a lot and others (are) saying that the portion is so huge. Why so big? I say because it’s the American version, it’s the American portion,” he said.ALSO READ | Kim Jong Un impersonator questioned on arrival in SingaporeAt the Mexican restaurant Lucha Loco, they’re promising to “make tacos great again” by selling specialty tacos by the name of “El Gringo,” which in Spanish means the foreigner, and “El Hombre Cohete,” which translates as the rocket man. The former has the flavors of an American cheeseburger, while the latter is packed with Korean fried chicken. Executive chef Nelson Burgos said the restaurant is also offering customers the chance to smash piñatas shaped as caricatures of the two leaders that are filled with sweets. It’s “a gesture of celebration for us and for having such a big event in Singapore,” he said. “It’s an event that’s probably never going to happen again in our lifetimes.”Meanwhile, at the nightspot Escobar, they’re offering specialty summit cocktails.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742ce24719c855c40cfd4e"},"header":"Trump-Kim summit: What the handshake in Singapore means for India","time":"\nMonday, August 20, 2018\n\n","content":"Express Audio: Veteran journalist Coomi Kapoor on media freedom and how it has changed over the yearsUS President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un created history on Tuesday by shaking hands and hence signaling the coming together for the first time in more than half a century of their countries. The US-North Korea summit held in Singapore’s Sentosa Island resulted in the signing of a “comprehensive document” pledging, among other things, complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.As the two leaders came together to make the historic negotiation, the entire world watched with much anticipation. The two countries have been at loggerheads with each other since the 1950s, when cold war politics resulted in the Korean peninsula being divided between the North and the South. While on one hand, South Korea got into a powerful alliance with America, the North, under Communist influence, became a strong ally of the USSR. In the ensuing years, while the Soviet Union disintegrated, North Korea’s relations with America was primarily marked by an aggressive nuclear weapons programme.Through these years of conflict between the two countries, India has had a rather curious relationship with North Korea. After the Second World War, when the world split into two with supporters on either the side of America or that of the Soviet Union, India declared its stance of non-alignment. Consequently, it never interfered in the military operations of either of the countries, but it did provide humanitarian aid to North Korea during the war. Over the years though, geopolitics has ensured that neither has it offered its fullest support to the country on account of the relations necessitated with South Korea and America, nor has India completely alienated itself from the region as a consequence of the troubled relations that the latter shares with the neighbouring regions of Pakistan and China. The summit on Tuesday, however, might change much in the space of diplomatic ties between the two countries.The first time that India and North Korea developed consular relations was in 1962 and in 1973, full diplomatic ties were established between the two countries. “Relations between India and North Korea have been historically positive, marred only by North Korea-Pakistan ties related to missile and nuclear technology. This is principally a reflection of India’s position of strategic autonomy which will not allow another country (read: the US) to determine the shape and form of India’s bilateral relations (at least in theory),” foreign policy expert and Fellow at Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Abhijnan Rej told Indianexpress.com.India’s commitment to go ahead with diplomatic relations with North Korea is evident from the fact that the former continued to have an embassy at Pyongyang, despite significant pressure from the USA to not do so. “One should also remember that India was for DPRK, till recently, its third largest trading partner,” says Rej. As per government data, in the year 2015-16, Indian exports from North Korea amounted to $111 million, while imports amounted to $88 million.Further, the Center for Space Science and Technology in Asia and the Pacific (CSSTEAP) located in Dehradun is reported to have been one of the first institutes in the world to have provided technical training to North Korean students, even after the United Nations declared its first set of nuclear sanctions against the country in 2006. In fact, it has been an embarrassment for India that courses offered in the institute directly trained several North Korean applicants in nuclear strategy.The famine that crippled the North Korean economy in the mid 1990s, continued to plague the nation for a long time, with food shortages being repeatedly reported from there. A lesser known fact, however, is the amount of aid provided by the Manmohan Singh-led government to the peninsula at a time when the country was isolated from practically every other corner. In 2010, reportedly, 900 tonnes of soya beans and 373 tonnes of wheat was sent across to North Korea from India to help revive its food economy.It was only in 2017 that India’s Ministry of External Affairs, reacting strongly to North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile launch, declared a ban on all trade with the region, with the exception of shipments of food and medicine. The declaration brought to an end the long-held trade links between the two countries. The decision to ban trade links with North Korea came at a time when India was increasing its trade links with South Korea.Most importantly though, North Korea’s consistently growing nuclear aggression was a cause of worry to India in the face of a possible collaboration between Pyongyang and Pakistan. Reportedly, since the 1990s nuclear technology was indirectly transferred between Pakistan and North Korea, and the increased show of nuclear strength on the part of the latter raises concerns for India.Less than a month before the summit at Singapore was scheduled to be held, India’s Minister of State for External Affairs, V K Singh visited Pyongyang. This was the first high-level visit from India to North Korea in over 20 years. In the coming weeks, New Delhi would be preparing for the visit of South Korean president Moon Jae-in. The meeting between America and North Korea, is being closely watched by New Delhi for the impact it might have on future relations and involvement with North Korea.While the possibility of a collaboration with Pakistan is foremost on the list of concerns for India when it comes to North Korea’s anticipated denuclearisation drive, a new relationship between Washington and Pyongyang could also benefit India in ensuring a new market in the East Asia. This is significant to the country in the wake of the Modi government’s ‘Act East policy’ that focuses on increasing economic ties between India and its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region.However, experts are still unsure of the precise outcome of the summit, making it difficult to foresee an impact it might have on the Indian policy. “It is entirely unclear, going beyond the hoopla, what this summit has achieved beyond a DPRK assurance to commit to “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula. It is unclear whether the North Korean understanding of ‘denuclearisation’ and that of the US’s match, so Kim’s commitment lacks specificity. In principle, a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons contributes to regional stability — and as such will be welcomed by most countries, India included. It is, however, unclear at this stage exactly how far all parties are from that goal,” says Rej.\n\u003cimg width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/adrija-roy.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003eAdrija RoychowdhuryAdrija is senior sub-editor, Indian Express.

US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un might be among those few. At their much anticipated summit meeting here Tuesday, Trump and Kim Jong-un have begun an unprecedented effort to dismantle a seven-decade-old conflict in the Korean Peninsula. Working together with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump and Kim are getting ready to turn Asian geopolitics inside out.READ | Reading the Singapore Summit statement: Three principles and one political gestureThe story of the summit between Trump and Kim began as a narrow narrative on de-nuking North Korea. It has now turned into an extraordinary tale of turning sworn enemies — Washington and Pyongyang — into friends, healing the tragic partition of the Korean Peninsula, and reducing American forward military presence in East Asia.ALSO READ | Donald Trump, Kim Jong-Un sign ‘comprehensive document’ at historic Singapore summitIn publicly discussing the prospect of withdrawing American troops from South Korea at some future date when peace prevails in the Peninsula, Trump has set a cat among the Asian pigeons. In hinting at potential American military retrenchment, Trump might compel the region to seek a new balance of power.But first to the three principles outlined in the deceptively bald statement issued after the meeting between Trump and Kim. For the nuclear nerds and the media focused on ‘complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament’ — CVID for short — it is a rude shock to find it missing in the joint statement.READ | Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un Singapore summit: Here’s what they saidTo be sure, there is a reference to ‘complete denuclearisation’ in the third principle and Kim’s ‘firm and unwavering commitment’ to it. But it is embedded in a larger political construct about changing the nature of the political relationship between America and North Korea. If American conventional strategic wisdom put the technical above the political, Trump has reversed the equation.The first principle in the joint statement talks about commitment of Trump and Kim to establish a new relationship between the two nations. The second principle connects nuclear disarmament to the de-escalation of the larger security dynamic in the Peninsula. It calls for a joint effort to build a ‘lasting and stable peace regime’.READ | Trump-Kim summit: What the Singapore handshake means for IndiaThis is probably the most weighty element of the framework unveiled by Trump and Kim. This is where the question of American security guarantees to North Korea come. Trump’s comments at the lengthy press conference after the talks go a long way in assuring Kim that Washington is not contemplating regime change in North Korea.Trump refused to rise to the bait when the Western journalists repeatedly pushed him on the question of human rights in North Korea. He showered praise on Kim as a ‘talented leader’. He did not flinch from his emphasis on building friendship with Kim. He went lyrical on the shared destiny of North and South Korea and the benefits of national reconciliation in the Peninsula.Even more important, Trump announced that he is suspending the routine US military exercises in South Korea that the North has always seen as provocative. The peace regime could also involve many measures to de-escalate the military tensions between North and South Korea.READ | North Korea state media plasters front pages with Kim Jong Un’s Singapore tripTrump’s musings on bringing home the 32,000 US troops in South Korea at some point in future has sent shock waves through the American establishment. While the President insisted that the withdrawal is not on the cards for now, he has revealed an important element of his world view.During his campaign for Presidency in 2016 — before that as well as since — Trump has consistently raised questions about the costs and benefits of US military presence in Asia. He has insisted that America’s allies must do more. In suggesting that the region must fend for itself, Trump has opened up space for rearranging the international relations of East Asia.Trump is not the only revisionist in Asia. Kim’s emphasis on economic modernisation has turned the nuclear arsenal into a negotiating instrument rather than an end in itself. Moon, without whom Trump and Kim could not have got to Singapore, has defied the conventional wisdom in betting that reconciliation with the North is possible.As the trio disrupts the regional order, two nations will put on their thinking hat. Both Tokyo and Beijing are deeply wary of Korean nationalism and the potential unity between North and South. Japan’s premier Shinzo Abe will have no choice but to evaluate Japan’s national security options if he sees that Trump is bent on scaling down American commitment to Asian alliances.China, which should have been happy at American retrenchment, has reasons of its own to worry. For the strategic vacuum resulting from such retrenchment will create many new instabilities, encourage its Asian neighbours to strengthen their national military postures, including the consideration of nuclear weapons.But nowhere is the shock more apparent than in Washington where Trump’s Korean framework is generating a political backlash. His ability to mollify the domestic reaction would depend on how quickly he can move, along with Kim and Moon, in translating the Singapore framework into concrete outcomes. If the three disrupters stumble, the old order will strike back with great force.\n\u003cimg width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/c-raja-mohan21.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003eC.

Both the countries have agreed to joint effort to build a stable and peaceful regime, while Washington has also committed to provide security guarantees to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).The historic document also said the two sides have agreed to recover the remains of Prisoners of War and those missing in action and repatriating them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials would hold follow-up negotiations “at the earliest possible date”, the statement said.The commitment from both the leaders came at a time when the entire world was watching them keenly as they conducted their historic summit in Singapore. “We’re signing a very comprehensive document, and we’ve had a really great time together, a great relationship,” Trump said while signing the document along with Kim in the presence of media at the end of the summit – the first between a sitting US president and North Korea’s top leader. In response to a question about denuclearisation, Trump said. “We have decided to leave the past behind,” Kim said through a translator, at the signing table. “The world will see a major change,” he added.“People are going to be very impressed and people are going to be very happy and we are going to take care of a very dangerous problem for the world,” Trump said. Calling Kim a “very worthy, very hard negotiator,” and someone who “loves his country very much,” Trump he had formed a “very special bond” with Kim and that relationship with North Korea would be very different.Follow LIVE UPDATES on the Donald Trump-Kim Jong Un summitThe exchange of pleasantries followed a series of meetings held today in Singapore. The meeting, that seemed impossible a few months ago, marks a dramatic shift in relations between Trump and Kim Jong, who traded insults and threats of war till early this year.Both the leaders met this morning at the Capella Hotel, a secluded luxury resort on Singapore’s Sentosa Island. After a handshake that lasted for 13 seconds, both Trump and Kim remained hopeful of the Summit. Both also posed for the camera briefly after which Trump guided Kim Jong to a close door one-on-one summit. “Nice to meet you Mr President,” were Kim’s first words, to which Trump responded, “It’s my honour and we will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt.”In Pictures | Donald Trump, Kim Jong-Un’s historic Singapore handshakeAfter an interaction that lasted little less than an hour, Trump and Kim emerged, walking side-by-side through the colonnaded hotel before entering a meeting room, where they were joined by senior officials from their countries. Kim was heard telling Trump through a translator: “I think the entire world is watching this moment. Many people in the world will think of this as a scene from a fantasy… science fiction movie.” Adding that meet was “very, very, very good,” Trump said both the countries have an “excellent relationship.” Trump was joined by Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, for the expanded talks, while Kim’s team included former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and Ri Su Yong, vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party.Read | Donald Trump, Kim Jong-un summit: Beaches, theme parks, golf courses and more reasons to visit SentosaBoth the parties then left for bilateral talks and shared a working lunch together.

The two leaders arrived in the tropical city-state on Sunday. Key gaps remain over what denuclearisation would entail for two countries that have been enemies since the 1950-1953 Korean War, and the officials were trying to push the agenda forward before their leaders meet on Tuesday.Commenting for the first time on the agenda, North Korea’s state-run KCNA news agency said the two sides would exchange “wide-ranging and profound views” to re-set relations. It heralded the summit as part of a “changed era”. Discussions would focus on “the issue of building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula, the issue of realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern,” KCNA said.In the lead up to the summit, North Korea rejected any unilateral nuclear disarmament, and KCNA’s reference to denuclearisation of the peninsula has historically meant that Pyongyang wants the United States to remove its “nuclear umbrella” protecting South Korea and Japan. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is also in Singapore, said in a tweet that Washington was “committed to the complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”.A Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US side was entering the talks with a sense of optimism and an equal dose of scepticism given North Korea’s long history of developing nuclear weapons. “We will not be surprised by any scenario,” said the official.With the eyes of the world following him, Trump flew into Singapore’s Paya Lebar Air Base aboard Air Force One on Sunday, fresh from a divisive G7 meeting in Canada with some of Washington’s closest allies that further strained global trade ties. Asked by a reporter how he felt about the summit, Trump said: “Very good”. In a tweet on Monday, he said: “Great to be in Singapore, excitement in the air!”Kim had arrived hours earlier on a plane loaned by China, which for decades has been North Korea’s only major ally. Both leaders were greeted on arrival by Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. When Trump and Kim meet at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Tuesday they will be making history as leaders of their two countries have never met previously – or even spoken on the telephone. The summit’s venue is the Capella hotel on Sentosa, a resort island off Singapore’s port with a Universal Studios theme park and man-made beaches.Trump is to meet Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday while Kim has no official agenda. Kim arrived at Singapore’s Changi Airport after his longest trip overseas as head of state, wearing his trademark dark “Mao suit” and distinctive high-cut hairstyle. He has not left his country since taking office in 2011 other than to visit China and the South Korean side of the border Demilitarised Zone. Travelling with him were top officials including Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, Defence Minister No Kwang Chol and Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of Kim who has been instrumental in the diplomacy that culminated in Tuesday’s summit.Kim Yo Jong, leader Kim’s younger sister, was also spotted in his delegation. She emerged as an influential figure in Pyongyang’s opaque leadership in February, when she led a North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea. Officials who arrived with Trump include Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.Bolton’s hardline rhetoric last month infuriated North Korea and nearly derailed the summit. He called for North Korea to follow a “Libya model” in negotiations. Libya unilaterally surrendered its nuclear weapons programme in 2003, but its leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was killed in 2011 by NATO-backed rebels.Trump, speaking in Canada on Saturday, said any agreement at the summit would be “spur of the moment,” underscoring the uncertain outcome of what he called a “mission of peace”. He initially touted the potential for a grand bargain with North Korea to rid itself of a nuclear missile programme that has advanced rapidly to threaten the United States. But he has since lowered expectations, backing away from an original demand for North Korea’s swift denuclearisation. He has said the talks would be more about starting a relationship with Kim for a negotiating process that would take more than one summit.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said US and North Korean officials would hold working-level talks on Monday. She said the US delegation would be led by Sung Kim, a veteran diplomat who recently held talks with North Korean officials. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday’s meeting appeared aimed at making 11th-hour progress ahead of the summit since Sung Kim’s earlier talks did little to narrow a gap between the two sides on the definition of denuclearisation or win agreement on tangible commitments from Pyongyang toward dismantling its nuclear arsenal.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/changed-era-as-donald-trump-north-koreas-kim-jong-un-singapore-summit-5212351/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:14:22.717Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

Now Gurkhas serve in the British, Indian and Nepalese armies, as well as in Brunei and Singapore. They have fought in both world wars as well as the Falklands conflict and, more recently, in Afghanistan.Huxley said the Gurkhas had long proven to be an asset to Singapore’s leadership, providing a neutral force within an ethnically diverse city-state, including VIP and anti-riot protection. At times of regional tension, they have protected international schools, and are often seen at the Malaysia-Singapore border crossings.The Singapore Police website describes the group as “tough, vigilant and steadfast” that operates “across the spectrum of paramilitary operations to help safeguard Singapore”. They live with their families in the secure Mount Vernon Camp outside the city, an enclave that ordinary Singaporeans are not allowed to enter.A woman married to a Gurkha who lived in the camp said life there was restricted. “We have a curfew of 12 midnight,” she said. “For women, we can let them know if we have a genuine reason to stay out, for men, there is no excuse. “One of the rules we have is that we have to be in bed by 10.30 p.m. every night.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742d184719c855c40cfd5c"},"header":"\nTrump, Kim Jong Un arrive in Singapore ahead of historic summit\n","time":" 21 m ","content":"Singapore: President Donald Trump landed in Singapore on the evening of June 10, joining North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the island city-state ahead of one of the most unusual and highly anticipated summits in recent world history, a Tuesday sit-down meant to settle a standoff over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.Air Force One touched down at a military air base, travelling from Canada, where Trump had attended a meeting of the Group of Seven Nations. Hours earlier, a jet carrying Kim landed, and after shaking hands with the Singapore foreign minister, Kim sped through the city's streets in a massive limousine, two large North Korean flags fluttering on the hood, surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows and bound for the luxurious and closely guarded St Regis Hotel.Also Read: Kim Jong Un arrives in Singapore for historic summit with TrumpKim smiled broadly on Sunday evening as he met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\"The entire world is watching the historic summit between (North Korea) and the United States of America, and thanks to your sincere efforts ... we were able to complete the preparations for the historic summit,\" Kim told Lee through an interpreter. Trump is set to meet with Lee tomorrow.Trump has said he hopes to win a legacy-making deal with the North to give up their nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting.The North, many experts believe, stands on the brink of being able to target the entire US mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep scepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the US and the North.This will be the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting US president.The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.The North Korean autocrat's every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists who have converged on Singapore, and by gawkers around the world, up until he shakes hands with Trump on Tuesday.It's a reflection of the intense global curiosity over Kim's sudden turn to diplomacy in recent months after a slew of North Korean nuclear and missile tests last year raised serious fears of war. Part of the interest in Tuesday's summit is simply because Kim has had such limited appearances on the world stage. He has only publicly left his country three times since taking power after his father's death in late 2011 — twice travelling to China and once across his shared border with the South to the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone in recent summits with the leaders of China and South Korea respectively. But it is Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons that gives his meeting with Trump such high stakes.The meeting was initially meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-you session.Trump has also raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.It's unclear what Trump and Kim might decide Tuesday.Pyongyang has said it is willing to deal away its entire nuclear arsenal if the United States provides it with a reliable security assurance and other benefits. But many say this is highly unlikely, given how hard it has been for Kim to build his program and that the weapons are seen as the major guarantee to holding onto his unchecked power. Any nuclear deal will hinge on North Korea's willingness to allow unfettered outside inspections of the country's warheads and nuclear fuel, much of which is likely kept in a vast complex of underground facilities. Past nuclear deals have crumbled over North Korea's reluctance to open its doors to outsiders.Another possibility from the summit is a deal to end the Korean War, which North Korea has long demanded, presumably, in part, to get US troops off the Korean Peninsula and, eventually, pave the way for a North Korean-led unified Korea. The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, but the war technically continues today because instead of a difficult-to-negotiate peace treaty, military officers for the US-led United Nations, North Korea and China signed an armistice that halted the fighting.The North may see a treaty — and its presumed safety assurances from Washington — as its best way of preserving the Kim family dynasty. The ensuing recognition as a \"normal country\" could then allow sanctions relief, and later international aid and investment.Just meeting with Trump will also give Kim a recognition North Korea has long sought, setting him up as global player and equal to the US domestically and, internationally, as the leader of a \"normal country\" worthy of respect.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/100618/trump-kim-jong-un-arrive-in-singapore-ahead-of-historic-summit.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:19:01.499Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

Koh, group managing director of the company.Singapore City then sold 587 units in May, more than quadruple the number in April, making it the top-selling development in the area, he said. That drove the price from an average of about 4,000 yuan ($625) per square metre in 2015 to close to 6,000 yuan per square metre.\"Suddenly everybody came in. From that time onwards we started selling 30-40 units a day,\" he told Reuters in an interview at the project's showroom, decorated with water-spouting statues of Singapore's unofficial mascot, the mythical Merlion.Trump sent the city-state spinning when he announced that the summit would be held there last month, only to cancel it a week later. On June 1, he said the summit was back on, prompting urgent preparations and a wave of promotions from businesses looking to cash in.Koh said he did not think the Singapore's host status was driving buyers to its namesake project, saying it was ultimately the development's location in Dandong where the broader property market has heated up.Still, he said he was contemplating launching activities to commemorate the event at the showroom, though he was a little cautious, citing the uncertain nature of the meeting and the countries' leaders.\"It's still a wait and see, because you don't know if it'll be a success or failure,\" he said. \"If it's a failure then we'll have a problem. All the investors will run away!\"","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/090618/ahead-of-trump-kim-summit-singapore-city-on-north-korean-border-has-s.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:19:26.338Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

He has also dangled the prospect of Kim Jong Un visiting Washington if the meeting goes well.But even the merit of the event itself -- long sought by the North, and which Trump apparently impulsively agreed to in March, reportedly without consulting his advisers -- has been called into question.\"People call it a historic summit but... it is important to understand that this summit was available to any US president who wanted to do it and the point is no US president wanted to do this, and for good reasons,\" said Christopher Hill, a former lead US nuclear negotiator with North Korea.The two countries have been at loggerheads for decades. The North invaded the South in 1950 and the ensuing war saw US-led UN troops backing Seoul fight their way to a stalemate against Pyongyang's forces which were aided by Russia and China, before the conflict ended in stalemate and an armistice which sealed the division of the peninsula.Sporadic provocations by the North have continued while Pyongyang has made increasing advances in its nuclear arsenal, which it says it needs to defend against the risk of a US invasion.Last year it carried out by far its most powerful nuclear test to date and launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, sending tensions soaring to a level unseen in years as a newly-elected Trump traded threats of war and colourful personal insults with Kim, with Trump dubbed a \"dotard\" and Kim \"Little Rocket Man\".But the South's Winter Olympics in February catalysed a flurry of diplomatic moves as Seoul's dovish leader Moon Jae-in sought to bring the two sides together. Kim has met twice with both Moon and Xi Jinping, the president of China, the North's most important ally.Pyongyang has taken some steps to show sincerity, returning US detainees and blowing up its nuclear test site.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that progress was being made in bringing the two sides together in their understanding of denuclearisation. But Trump -- for whom a major accomplishment would bolster his position ahead of midterm elections in November -- baffled observers when he said he did not think he had to prepare \"very much\" for the summit.\"It's about attitude,\" Trump said. \"So this isn't a question of preparation.\" ","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/100618/kim-jong-un-arrives-in-singapore-for-historic-summit-with-trump.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:20:23.163Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

He studied medicine and later pursued postgraduate education in ophthalmology.Shanmugam is Singapore's Minister for Law and Home Affairs and he is responsible for ensuring security at the summit, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean top leader.A lawyer by profession, Shanmugam, 59, also belongs to the ruling People's Action Party.Singapore is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea.Balakrishnan, who received Kim, the Chairman of North Korea's State Affairs Commission, on Sunday at Changi Airport, said the summit comes after 70 years of suspicion, war and diplomatic failures.\"This is not the way conventional diplomacy would have been conducted, but perhaps you need two very unconventional leaders to have brought us to this stage,\" he told the BBC.\"They may be able to pull rabbits out of a hat that the rest of us conventional diplomats would not have been able to do,\" he said.Still, he noted that decades of tension cannot be resolved in one meeting, although, based on his interactions with their staff and meeting them personally, \"both are supremely confident, both are hopeful\".Balakrishnan also said that the Singapore government was footing the hotel bill for Kim Jong Un and his delegation who are staying at the St Regis hotel.He added that the expenditure forms part of the 20 million Singapore dollars (USD 15 million) that Singapore is spending on the summit in all.Of this, half is on security, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday.Meanwhile, Law and Home Affairs Minister Shanmugam is confident that security is in place for the Trump-Kim summit.\"The fact that we prepared this in two weeks, this adds to logistics demands by officers who worked around the clock,\" Shanmugam said at a security briefing on Sunday.\"We are confident that we have put security in place. We have 5,000 Home Team officers such as police and emergency response teams like civil defence,\" he was quoted as saying by Channel News Asia.Shanmugam said that four people have been turned away at Singapore's immigration checkpoints in the lead-up to the summit.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/110618/2-indian-origin-ministers-in-singapore-play-key-role-in-facilitating-t.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:20:43.084Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

The two leaders are expected to address the complete denuclearisation of the peninsula and possibly declare an end to the nearly seven-decade-long Korean War.North Korea's state media said on Monday (June 11) that the two leaders will discuss a \"permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism\" on the Korean peninsula, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern.More than 2,500 international media personnel have descended upon Singapore, with images and footage of first Mr Kim's arrival, and then Mr Trump's, beamed live across the world.\"From our point of view, it's important that the meeting takes place, and that the meeting sets developments on a new trajectory - one that will be conducive to the security and stability of the region,\" Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after a visit to the media centre at the F1 Pit Building.Mr Lee also met Mr Kim at the Istana on Sunday evening, with Mr Kim - officially Chairman of the State Affairs Commission - expressing gratitude for Singapore's efforts to host the meeting. If the summit is successful, it would put Singapore in the history books, he added.The Trump-Kim Singapore summit will cost the hosts about $20 million, with about half going towards security costs.The protection accorded to both leaders was evident yesterday as traffic was stopped on roads as well as expressways to allow for uninterrupted passage of their convoys.The sight of two black limousines, with the respective flags of North Korea and the United States fluttering, amid a convoy of over 30 vehicles drew eager onlookers from the eastern part of the island to the central.Mr Trump is scheduled to meet Mr Lee on Monday (June 11) before Tuesday's meeting with Mr Kim. US and North Korean officials will also hold last-minute talks in Singapore on Monday, White House spokesman Sarah Sanders said.Should the summit go well, it will be in stark contrast to the G-7 summit, where Mr Trump pulled the US out of a previously agreed communique after he had boarded the flight to Singapore, citing \"false statements\" by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In Singapore, the excitement was palpable. Hundreds whipped out camera phones to capture Mr Kim's entourage as it made its way from the St Regis Singapore, where he is staying, to the Istana.The Tanglin area, where both the St Regis and the Shangri-La Hotel, which will host Mr Trump, are located, was packed with onlookers.Among those who caught a glimpse of Mr Trump's motorcade was Mr Teo Hong Mong, 78, a retired aircraft engineer. He said: \"I wanted to see his big, fantastic limousine.

And like that declaration, the document signed in Singapore did not lay out a clear timeline for North Korea's denuclearisation.Still, speaking at a news conference at the Capella Singapore hotel on Sentosa island, Mr Trump said Mr Kim gave his “unwavering commitment” to work towards denuclearisation  and they are prepared to “write a new chapter” between their countries.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Kim said: \"Today we had a very historic meeting, overcoming our past history and embarking on a new beginning...the world will see a major change.\"Mr Trump, in turn, said a turning point has been reached in the long fraught US-North Korea relationship. \"We're both going to do something, and we've developed a very special bond...we're going to take care of a very big and dangerous problem for the rest of the world.\"It worked out far better for both of us than anybody could have expected,\" he added.The two leaders signed the document at an 80-year-old, 4.3 m-long teak wood table once used by Singapore’s Chief Justices and on loan from the National Gallery.They sat side by side at the table and were flanked on either side by American and North Korean flags. The day had started with a historic handshake between the two leaders at the hotel.At 9.04am, Mr Trump and Mr Kim strode into the courtyard from separate sides, stood face to face for the first time and shared a 12-second handshake against a backdrop of American and North Korean flags.The moment - tightly choreographed, with both men walking out at exactly the same time - was the culmination of weeks of uncertainty, false starts and finally, frenetic preparations on the part of the US, North Korea and Singapore.From that point forward, the superlatives flowed. When asked how he felt as they sat down for talks, Mr Trump said: \"I feel really great.  We’re going to have a great discussion and, I think, tremendous success. It will be tremendously successful. And it's my honour. And we will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt.\"Mr Kim said: \"It was not easy to get here. The past worked as fetters on our limbs, and the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles on our way forward. But we overcame all of them, and we are here today\".A 41-minute one-on-one meeting ended with the two leaders smiling and waving to the media from a balcony and Mr Trump saying the discussion was \"very very good\".Then at the extended bilateral meeting, Mr Kim said he believed the summit was a \"great prelude to peace\", to which Mr Trump agreed. \"Of course there will be difficulties along the way, but as of today, a day that a good start has been made, I am determined to start a grand undertaking together,\" he added.  After the signing ceremony, Mr Trump told the media: \"We had a terrific day and we learnt a lot about each other and our countries.\" Calling Mr Kim \"a very worthy, very smart negotiator\", Mr Trump said: \"He's a very talented man, I also learnt that he loves his country very much.\" He added: \"We'll meet again, we'll meet many times\"When asked if  he would invite Mr Kim to the White House, Mr Trump said: “Absolutely, I will.”It was a remarkable turnaround from last year when the two leaders traded insults and threats as Pyongyang conducted a series of ballistic missile tests.Mr Kim acknowledged the historic moment on Tuesday morning when he was heard telling Mr Trump through a translator: “I think the entire world is watching this moment. Many people in the world will think of this as a scene from a fantasy... science fiction movie.”The two sides also had a working lunch. Before they sat down, Mr Trump told the media to get a good photo. \"Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.”Lunch was a nine-course meal with both Western and Asian flavours, according to the White House. The starters included mango kerabu – a Malay salad – and oiseon or Korean stuffed cucumbers and the main dishes were beef short rib confit and sweet and sour crispy pork with Yangzhou fried rice. Dessert included dark chocolate tartlet ganache and Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The US delegation included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, US Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim, and National Security Council senior director for Asia Matt Pottinger joined the working lunch.The North Korean delegation included vice-chairman of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, Mr Kim Yong Chol, party vice-chairman and director of North Korea's International Affairs Department Ri Su Yong, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote on his Facebook page after the summit: \"It is a crucial first move in the long journey towards lasting peace and stability on a denuclearised Korean Peninsula, which would benefit our region and the rest of the world.\"I wrote to Mr Kim and Mr Trump to congratulate them on a successful summit. Singapore is honoured to have played host. We join the international community in celebrating this outcome, and wishing both the US and DPRK success in implementing this agreement,'' said Mr Lee, referring to North Korea by its formal name - Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.South Korean President Moon Jae In also hailed the summit, calling it a \"historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy\". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the talks were an important first step. “I support this as a first step to the comprehensive resolution of issues concerning North Korea.”  China praised the summit and urged   full denuclearisation by North Korea. “The crux of the peninsula nuclear issue is a security issue. The most  difficult part of this security issue is for the United States and North Korea to sit down to find a way to resolution through equal talks,” said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. \"At the same time, there needs to be a peace mechanism for the Korean peninsula to resolve North Korea’s reasonable security concerns,” he added.  There was an unprecedented level of security around the summit venue and the two luxury hotels where the two leaders stayed after they arrived in Singapore on Sunday (June 10). Roads and expressways leading from St Regis Singapore and Shangri-La hotel were locked down on Tuesday morning as the  leaders made their way to the Capella hotel on Sentosa, with many people gathered at different spots along the route, trying to catch a glimpse of the leaders.Property agent Joe Tham, 48, and his wife, who had waited outside Paya Lebar Air Base on Sunday for Mr Trump's arrival, brought chairs for the wait for Mr Kim in Tanglin Road.\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment... it's very important to Singapore, and we want to be a part of it, to witness it,\" he said.Housewife Gladys Tan, 55, who lives near Shangri-La Hotel, said it was her second time waiting for Mr Trump, but she still could not see him through the tinted car window.\"I tried very, very hard but the glass is so black, I couldn't see anything. Or maybe my eyesight is just poor... I couldn't wave at him so I waved at the policemen on motorbike. Consolation prize!\" she said.The perimetre of the Capella hotel was fortified with road blocks on one side. Coast guard vessels patrolled the waters off the resort's beach.Some curious onlookers turned up early on Sentosa to catch a glimpse of the convoys. Among them were students Gideon Tan, 16, Aryan Singh, 16, and Joshua Tan, 17. Joshua, a keen reader of politics and history, said it would be ideal if Mr Kim could commit to immediate denuclearisation and he  hoped that Mr Trump can provide the security assurance that North Korea wants. About 5,000 Home Team officers were deployed for the summit.All in, Singapore spent about $20 million to host the historic meeting, which included picking up the North Korean contingent's hotel bill.Prime Minister Lee said that the significance of the meeting meant it was a price that Singapore was willing to pay.\"If you calculate the price of everything in this world, you will miss out on the real important things. And, in this case, what is important is that the summit is held, and we are hosting it, not extravagantly but with due consideration to costs, but making sure operational requirements are met,\" he said. Mr Trump and Mr Kim thanked Singapore for hosting the summit during separate bilateral meetings with PM Lee at the Istana. The US president left Singapore after the press conference at Capella hotel on Tuesday. He departed from Paya Lebar Airbase on Air Force One at 6.25pm, slightly earlier than his scheduled 7pm departure time. We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

However, marketing experts say the coverage generated from the event could be worth more than 10 times that.\"It places Singapore on the map for international audiences,\" said Oliver Chong, executive director for communications and marketing capability at the Singapore Tourism Board.Tourism contributes around 4 per cent to Singapore's gross domestic product a year. Visitor arrivals hit a record 17.4 million last year, boosted by China, its top market, and India.But just months ago, lifestyle magazine Time Out ranked Singapore among the world's least exciting cities.Andrew Darling, chief executive and founder of communications agency West Pier Ventures, said it would cost more than S$200 million to generate the kind of publicity Singapore has received so far by hosting the summit.Media intelligence firm Meltwater said the coverage over the three days around the summit equated to US$270 million (S$360.5 million) of advertising, while the month leading up to it was worth US$767 million.\"The Trump-Kim summit has arguably been the single most important event that brought Singapore to the attention of most people around the world,\" said Jason Tan of media advertising agency Zenith Singapore.\"For many Asians, Singapore as the choice of destination reinforces our image as an efficient and safe country. For Americans who might not be as familiar with Asia, the summit definitely brought Singapore into the global spotlight.\"Still, even some who should know better struggled to accurately place Singapore - known as the Little Red Dot, in reference to its depiction on a map.The US State Department mistakenly made Singapore a part of neighbouring Malaysia in a note issued in connection with the summit, drawing a slew of snide comments on social media.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

It is understood that less than $5 million went to media costs, including the international media centre, for some 2,500 journalists. The Government did not elaborate on other expenses.But North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's tour of the Marina Bay area made the front pages of many newspapers, and the Singapore skyline appeared on many news bulletins, including that of late-night talkshow host Trevor Noah.Media intelligence firm Meltwater estimates that the advertising value, based on global online media mentions over the three days the leaders were here, added up to $270 million. But take into consideration the buzz generated since last month, and advertising value balloons to about $767 million, it said.The number would likely have been higher if the expected value of print, broadcast or social media mentions was also tracked.While different firms use different formulas to calculate the estimated media value, Meltwater said it arrived at its estimates by multiplying the number of people it reached by 0.025, which is the probability that someone will read an article, and then by 37 cents, which is the industry formula for the monetary value of someone reading an article.The hotels, in particular, gained the most from the attention. About half of online articles, or over 20,000, mentioned the Capella, where the one-day summit between United States President Donald Trump and Mr Kim was held. The hotels where Mr Trump and Mr Kim stayed in - Shangri-La and The St Regis, respectively - had a mention in a fifth of the articles each.Media monitoring firm Isentia said it was also meaningful to analyse the sentiments of such coverage, estimating that 69 per cent of the buzz generated by the summit was positive, compared with 24 per cent which was neutral and 7 per cent that was negative.Besides the media exposure, Singapore can expect at least $7.2 million from the three days based on tourism receipts, said Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior lecturer Michael Chiam. He arrived at this figure from the roughly 4,000 journalists and security personnel spending an average of $600 a day, including their accommodation, which would have formed the bulk of the costs.However, this short-term gain might be counterbalanced by visitors who stayed away because of the summit, said Singapore Polytechnic retail and marketing lecturer Lucas Tok.In fact, increased security measures on Sentosa and in Orchard may have deterred some shoppers, local and tourist, he said.However, all analysts pointed towards benefits that would be reaped further down the road.\"Where is Singapore?\" became one of the most-asked questions on Google and indicated an increased awareness of the country, they said.Mr Tok said: \"Usually, after a place has received some traction, visitor numbers tend to go up in the next few months.\"Mr Nicholas Fang, director of security and global affairs at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said the summit boosted Singapore's branding in a global competitive environment.\"The fact that a small country like Singapore could be the focal point of global attention for so many days will do no harm to the Singapore brand, and there will be flow-down benefits to Singapore companies and individuals on the international stage,\" he said.• Additional reporting by Seow Bei YiCorrection note: An earlier version of the article described Kim Jong Un as South Korean leader.

But we appreciate your hospitality and professionalism and your friendship. Thank you very much,\" President Trump told Mr Lee as they began their working lunch at the Istana.The two leaders shared a warm handshake in front of cameras at 12.45pm before they sat down with their delegations. Mr Lee and Mr Trump, who held a one-on-one meeting before the lunch, had a good discussion on a wide range of regional and global developments, according to Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  An MFA statement said: \"Both leaders reaffirmed the excellent relations between Singapore and the US across the economic, defence, and security spheres.\"President Trump thanked Prime Minister Lee for Singapore’s hosting of the US-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Summit. President Trump also expressed the US’ continued commitment to engage the region and his support for Singapore’s chairmanship of Asean.\"Mr Trump also accepted Singapore President Halimah Yacob's invitation to make a state visit to Singapore in November 2018, in conjunction with the 6th Asean-US Summit and 13th East Asia Summit, said the MFA.Mr Lee and Mr Trump last met in October 2017, during the Singapore leader's official working visit to Washington at Mr Trump’s invitation. Mr Trump, in his presidential state car nicknamed The Beast, arrived at the Istana before noon.  He was accompanied by a convoy of more than 30 vehicles from Shangri-La Hotel, where he is staying. Journalists and cameramen had been standing by around the hotel and the Istana for Mr Trump since about 10.30am.Mr Trump's delegation includes the following:Ms Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath, charge d'affaires of the US Embassy in Singapore; Mr Matthew Pottinger, senior director for Asian affairs of the US National Security Council (NSC); Mrs Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary; Mr John Bolton, US National Security Adviser; Mr Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State; Mr John Kelly, White House Chief of Staff; Mr Stephen Miller, senior adviser to the President for policy; Ms Mira Ricardel, Deputy National Security Adviser; Ms Sarah Tinsley, NSC senior director for strategic communications; Mr Peter Michael McKinley, US Ambassador to Brazil, and Ms Melissa Brown, Counsellor for Economic and Political Affairs at the US Embassy in Singapore.Members of PM Lee's delegation include Deputy PM Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung. Mr Ong posted a Facebook photo of Mr Trump, Mr Pompeo and Mr Kelly at the lunch. A copy of the menu was spotted in the photo. The Straits Times understands that the lunch was catered by Gordon Grill at Goodwood Park Hotel. Dishes on the menu include angus beef tenderloin, lobster bisque and cherry jubilee with clotted ice cream. During the meeting, the officials also celebrated Mr Trump's birthday. He is turning 72 on June 14.Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan posted a photo of Mr Trump posing with the birthday cake. \"Celebrating birthday, a bit early,\" he wrote.The US delegation left the Istana shortly after 2pm. Mr Pompeo, in a statement after the working lunch, said Mr Trump and the entire US team are looking forward to Tuesday's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\"We have had substantive and detailed meetings to date, including this morning with the North Koreans. The President is well-prepared for tomorrow’s engagement with Chairman Kim. The US position remains clear and unchanged.”Mr Trump held a meet-and-greet session at Shangri-la Hotel after his engagement at the Istana. At about 2.15pm, he gave a 20-minute speech to about 200 to 250 servicemen, embassy staff and Americans working here, thanking the embassy staff for their preparations for the summit, according to some attendees at the closed session.Mr Trump also described the lunch with his Singapore hosts as positive, and told the crowd he looked forward to the summit on Tuesday.Said Mr Liam Gimon, an American who worked in Singapore as a criminal intelligence officer at Interpol for the past two years: \"The president was very thankful for all the preparations Americans in Singapore - especially the embassy staff - has been putting in. He said he was also confident about the Summit with North Korea.\"Added Ms Kartika Johnson, 45, who attended the event as a relative of a US embassy staff: \"He made us feel appreciated.\"Mr Trump landed at Paya Lebar Air Base just the night before, after attending the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Canada. He retracted his endorsement of the major economic powers' joint communique while on his way to Singapore.Meanwhile, diplomats from the US and North Korea met behind closed doors at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore hotel, in a bid to narrow their differences ahead of the summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim on Tuesday morning.Former US special representative for North Korea policy Sung Kim, who has been leading the US in talks with North Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui in the border truce village of Panmunjom since last month, is said to be continuing the discussions with his counterpart in Singapore.Top of the agenda is Pyongyang's complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. Mr Kim is likely to ask for a security guarantee and the easing of sanctions in return, say analysts. A peace treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean War may also be on the table.Before sitting down for talks on Tuesday, Mr Trump intends to meet one on one with Mr Kim, the White House said.“We can expect a one-on-one at the beginning,” NSC spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters in Singapore on Monday.Media reports earlier quoted sources as saying the two men will meet briefly, with just their interpreters but no aides in the room.Mr Trump on Saturday said he believes he would know \"within the first minute\" of meeting Mr Kim if the North Korean leader is serious about surrendering his nuclear arsenal.Top aides will join them for the formal talks later, and they will most likely include Mr Pompeo and Mr Bolton, as well as Mr Kim's sister, Ms Kim Yo Jong, and top aide and former spy chief Kim Yong Chol.The summit is the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, and comes after a year of tension on the Korean peninsula stoked by Mr Kim's numerous missile tests and a \"maximum pressure\" campaign led by the US to curb Pyongyang.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Asked to elaborate, he replied: \"If you calculate the price of everything in this world, you will miss out on the real important things. And in this case what is important is that the summit is held, and we are hosting it, not extravagantly but with due consideration to costs, but making sure operational requirements are met.\"Besides the security bill, another substantial part of the costs is from facilitating the 2,500-strong contingent of journalists here. A Ministry of Communications and Information source said that this - including the set-up of the international media centre at the F1 Pit Building - comes in at around $5 million.The $20 million bill for the summit is a fraction of the $150 million spent each year to host past editions of the Formula One race.The issue of cost has, however, raised questions among some Singaporeans, who have also chafed at having to contend with restricted access and road closures.Asked about this, Mr Lee said that what is important to keep in mind is the significance of the summit and also what hosting it successfully could mean for Singapore.It is, he said, not just a whole-of-government effort, but a \"whole of Singapore effort\", involving people ranging from press officers to bomb disposal unit experts.It also includes ordinary Singaporeans whose lives have been \"a little bit inconvenienced because roads have been cordoned off and traffic jams can happen - I hope you will understand this is for a good cause, it is a national effort, and I hope we will all be able to work together to show the world what Singapore can do\".On Sunday, Mr Lee also visited Singapore Armed Forces troops deployed at Palawan Kidz City on Sentosa, and the Home Team command post in Novena. \"The officers have done a good job under very pressed circumstances,\" he said, pointing to the short notice given. It was only two weeks ago that it was confirmed the summit was going ahead.It is not easy to find a suitable location to host such a meeting, observed Mr Lee, as both the Americans and the North Koreans must agree on a venue that meets their requirements and is politically and diplomatically acceptable to them.\"Therefore, when the two sides asked us to host the meeting, we cannot say no,\" he said. \"We have to step up... We can do a good job.\"The summit is a plus for Singapore, in terms of its reputation, its standing and \"how people look at us\", he added. \"It gives us publicity. The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting - we did not ask for it, but we were asked and we agreed - says something about Singapore's relations with the parties, with America, with North Korea, also our standing in the international community.\"Singapore is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with both sides. Mr Lee added: \"I think people will sit up and say, why is this meeting happening in Singapore, and they will draw their conclusions, and they will see how things are run. And I'm sure that we will be able to show what Singapore can do, so I think it's a plus for Singapore.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

However, marketing experts say the coverage generated from the event could be worth more than 10 times that.\"It places Singapore on the map for international audiences,\" said Oliver Chong, executive director, communications and marketing capability at Singapore Tourism Board.Tourism contributes around 4 per cent to Singapore's GDP per annum. Visitor arrivals hit a record 17.4 million last year boosted by China, its top market, and India.But just months ago, lifestyle magazine Time Out ranked Singapore among the world's least exciting cities.Andrew Darling, CEO and founder of communications agency West Pier Ventures, said it would cost more than US$200 million to generate the kind of publicity Singapore has received so far by hosting the summit.Media intelligence firm Meltwater said the coverage over the three days around the summit equated to US$270 million of advertising, while the month leading up to it was worth US$767 million.\"The Trump-Kim Summit has arguably been the single most important event that brought Singapore to the attention of the most people around the world,\" said Jason Tan of media advertising agency Zenith Singapore.\"For many Asians, Singapore as the choice of destination reinforces our image as an efficient and safe country. For Americans who might not be as familiar with Asia, the summit definitely brought Singapore into the global spotlight.\"Online travel agent Expedia said its data showed searches from global customers for trips to Singapore had risen by 58 per cent on Jun 10 and Jun 11 relative to the same days in 2017, including a 220 per cent rise in searches by US-based customers.Still, even some who should know better struggled to accurately place Singapore - known as the Little Red Dot in reference to its depiction on a map.The US State Department mistakenly made Singapore a part of neighbouring Malaysia in a note issued in connection with the summit, drawing a slew of snide comments on social media.(US$1 = 1.3363 Singapore dollars)(Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan and John Geddie.

Both Trump and Kim smiled and exchanged pleasantries before posing for photographs.They then adjourned to a sitting room where both Trump and Kim fielded questions. Trump spoke first and said: \"It’s my honour ... We will have a terrific relationship I have no doubt.\"Speaking in Korean, Kim said that \"it was not easy to get here\" and \"the old prejudices and practices worked as obstacles, but we have overcome them and we are here today\".The leaders then proceeded to have a one-on-one meeting with only their translators present, before stepping out after around 40 minutes to wave at the assembled media from a balcony. The US president described his private meeting with Kim as \"very good, very very good\".They were later joined by their delegations for a series of meetings.\"Working together we will get it taken care of,\" Trump told Kim at the start of the wider meeting. \"We will solve it.\"Both sides proceeded to have a scheduled working lunch after their meetings. Among the dishes for lunch were prawn cocktail, Yangzhou fried rice and beef short rib confit. Oiseon, a Korean stuffed cucumber, was served for starters, and Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate tartlet ganache were served for dessert.\"A lot of progress, really very positive - better than anybody could have expected,\" Trump told the media after his lunch meeting with Kim as they strolled out of the hotel side by side. \"Top of the line, really good.\"He then added that he and Kim would be signing a document at the Singapore summit. The two leaders even spent a short moment without their translators as they tried to build rapport between themselves. Trump even showed Kim his presidential limo, dubbed The Beast. \"THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR CHANGE\": KIMAt around 1.40pm, the leaders emerged along with key officials to sign a document. \"A lot of work and a lot of preparation went into this,\" said Trump. \"The meeting went better than expected and no one could've expected this.\"Kim expressed thanks to the US president for the summit's success. \"We had a historic meeting and we’ve decided to leave the past behind,\" he said. \"The world will see a major change. I would like to express my gratitude to President Donald Trump for making this happen.\"Both leaders shook hands again at the signing table with Trump saying he had developed a \"special bond\" with his younger counterpart. Asked by reporters if he would invite Kim to Washington, Trump said: \"Absolutely, I would.\" As both leaders stood on the verandah before Kim's departure from the Capella hotel, Trump said: \"We'll meet again. We will meet many times.\" The president added that he learned Kim is a \"very talented man\" and \"loves his country very much\".Trump said Kim was a \"worthy negotiator\", adding the North Korean leader had a \"great personality\" and was \"very smart\".TRUMP SAYS WILL STOP \"WAR GAMES\" WITH SOUTH KOREAIn a post-summit press conference which began at around 4.15pm, Trump spoke to the international media where he said the US will stop holding military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.Washington and Seoul are security allies and hold joint exercises every year that infuriate Pyongyang.\"We will be stopping the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money,\" Trump told reporters, adding that \"at some point\" he wanted to withdraw US troops from the South.Trump also added that Kim was committed to destroy a missile engine testing site, but did not elaborate further, except to say that this was agreed after the pair signed their \"comprehensive agreement\" earlier in the afternoon.On the issue of human rights, Trump said he had raised it during his meeting with Kim.\"We did discuss it today, strongly\" Trump said. \"We will be doing something on it. It's rough. It's rough in a lot of places, by the way.\"On denuclearisation, Trump said North Korea has “very substantial” nuclear arsenal, but believes the time on denuclearisation will “go very quickly”.Asked by Channel NewsAsia about the cost for denuclearisation for North Korea, Trump said he think South Korea and Japan will help them \"greatly\", says \"we won't have to help them\".Sanctions however, would remain on North Korea for now, but Trump said he wants to remove them as soon as possible.\"The sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor,\" Trump said. \"I hope it is soon ... at a certain point I look forward to taking them off.\"A HISTORIC DAY UNFOLDSAnticipation had been building in the lead-up to the unprecedented summit, with crowds lining the streets of Singapore when they arrived on Sunday.Both leaders left their hotels in the Orchard area of Singapore shortly after 8am local time on Tuesday as they headed for Sentosa, which is off Singapore’s southern coast.The route was lined by curious on-lookers and the media, with people standing three- to four-deep in some parts taking photos and waving as they craned to catch a glimpse of the leaders.  Trump, who left at around 8.05am from the Shangri-La Hotel, tweeted en route to the summit venue on a US Supreme Court ruling.Kim left the St Regis hotel shortly before 8.15am as his convoy – comprising about 20 security, North Korean state media and official vehicles – made its way to Sentosa.Crowds also camped out at VivoCity, outside the Sentosa Gateway, and on pavements in Sentosa to take photos and wave at the passing convoys of both leaders.Kim arrived for the meeting with his sister and confidante Kim Yo Jong and his trusted aide Kim Chang Son.As the two leaders met, Singapore navy vessels and air force Apache helicopters patrolled, while fighter jets and an Gulfstream 550 early warning aircraft circled.TRUMP BEGAN DAY ON OPTIMISTIC NOTEThe extraordinary summit - unthinkable only months ago - comes after the two nuclear-armed foes appeared on the verge of conflict late last year as they slung personal insults and Kim conducted nuclear and missile tests.In a series of tweets early Tuesday morning Singapore time, Trump indicated that summit preparations were \"going well and quickly\".\"We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen,\" he tweeted - before hitting out in a subsequent post at \"haters \u0026 losers\" who see the summit itself as a risky up-front concession to Kim.Pointing at the recent release of three American hostages and Pyongyang's pledge to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests, Trump charged that \"these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say!\"\"We will be fine!\" he tweeted.Trump had also said that he would use what he says are long-honed instincts to see whether Kim was bluffing, buying time or serious.Both Kim and Trump held bilateral talks with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday, when the US president also met with the American community in Singapore at the Shangri-La Hotel.Prime Minister Lee had on Sunday said that Singapore will spend S$20 million on the summit, adding that he hoped the historic meeting would result in a positive outcome.Kim took in the sights of the city on Monday night as he visited Gardens by the Bay and walked along the Marina Bay waterfront.He was accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards and North Korean state media personnel, as well as Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung.Since becoming North Korea's leader in late 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jong Il, Kim had made only three known international trips before his Singapore trip. He travelled to China twice and to the South Korean side of the truce village of Panmunjom.DEAL REMAINS TO BE SEENOn the eve of the meeting, aides from both sides were still scrambling to narrow yawning differences over \"denuclearisation\", which means vastly different things to the two parties.\"The complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula is the only outcome that the United States will accept,\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the eve of the summit.Pompeo added that the US was willing to offer the regime \"unique\" security guarantees, to \"provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearisation is not something that ends badly for them\".We’re live on YouTube with our comprehensive coverage on the Trump-Kim summit.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742e014719c855c40cfd84"},"header":"Trump-Kim summit a priceless branding opportunity for Singapore, Sentosa and hotels involved, say industry experts ","time":null,"content":"\n                                The images of Singapore – and Sentosa – splashed across the front pages of newspapers and television broadcasts worldwide will not only benefit Singapore’s tourism industry.SINGAPORE: With the world watching the upcoming Trump-Kim summit intently, the spotlight has also been turned on Singapore – and its role as host. And according to marketing and hospitality experts Channel NewsAsia spoke to, the summit is a priceless opportunity for Singapore to showcase itself to the world.Preparations are well underway for Tuesday’s summit, which will be held at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island, and in the lead-up, images of Singapore have been splashed across the front pages of newspapers and television broadcasts around the world.This, said founder of marketing consultancy Kepios Simon Kemp, can help raise valuable awareness about what the country can offer.“When I go travelling around the world, I find that a lot of people know that we exist, but they have no idea where we are on the map, and have no idea that we’re not part of China,” said Mr Kemp. “They have no idea how clean it is, how vibrant the city is...and once they do…I don’t think anything more than simple awareness is needed for people to add Singapore to their list of destinations.”“The Formula 1 race has done a wonderful job in projecting Singapore’s landscape, image, and beautiful skyline on a global scale, and the upcoming summit will do the same,” added Lars Voedisch, managing director of PRecious Communications. “This is something that a lot of countries would pay a lot of money for.”And when the throng of international media land in Singapore, they will experience, according to managing director of public relations firm Asia PR Werkz Cho Pei Lin, what she terms the “Singapore DNA”.“From welcoming them at Changi Airport, to our garden city, connected infrastructure and transport network, a SMART Nation, clean and efficient, and the ability to put together the summit at short notice whilst ensuring safety and security for the two delegations and Singaporeans,” she said. “It is an opportunity like never before to showcase Singapore to the world.”“As a Singaporean, I’m very proud that we are trusted by the United States and DPRK to put this together on such short notice,” she added.BENEFITS TO SINGAPORE GO BEYOND TOURISM DOLLARCiting high-level meetings Singapore has hosted in the past, such as the Shangri-La Dialogue and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, Mr Voedisch added that the summit will reinforce Singapore’s reputation for being a go-to destination for such meetings.This, he said, could also have benefits in attracting more foreign companies to set up shop in Singapore.“If everything goes as planned, it will re-emphasise the image that Singapore is one of the safest places on Earth,” he said. “Which company, CEO or family wouldn’t want that for their families and staff?”“The fact that both the President of the US and the North Korean leaders have chosen Singapore also shows that it’s easily accessible,” he added. “If you think about why Singapore attracts so many global and regional HQs, it’s because the CEOs and decision-makers feel that it’s not only a good place for them, but safe and enjoyable for their families.”“So it adds to the image that Singapore can not just attract tourists, but also the best of the international workforce.”Mr Kemp noted that the summit would also position Singapore as having a “relatively inclusive” culture and society. “It’s really interesting that two countries that are, perhaps, at complete opposite ends of the spectrum around the world have chosen Singapore as the place where they both feel comfortable,” he said.“I think that says a lot about what Singapore means to political leaders around the world.”Mr Voedisch added that from a political standpoint, Singapore’s reputation as a “neutral and trustworthy” player on the international stage will also be enhanced. “Singapore can also play up the image of a positive peacemaker,” he said. “That’s an added value that can come out of that.”BENEFITS EXTEND TO SENTOSA, HOTELS AS WELLThe Singapore Tourism Board (STB) noted that as with all high-profile visits, the Trump-Kim summit “places Singapore on the map for international audiences”, and “showcases Singapore as an ideal destination, especially for businesses and meetings.”And experts pointed out that this will benefit Sentosa in particular, which has largely been perceived and marketed largely as a tourist and leisure destination.“Sentosa is a tropical island off a tropical island,” said Mr Voedisch. “So in terms of the images, you have the greenery, landscape, and maritime shots that add to the flavour of what it’s known for.”“But it’s mainly known for being an entertainment and holiday destination for families, so the summit will help Sentosa to position itself as a great place to hold meetings and events.”“From a security perspective, you can see why Sentosa is attractive for such meetings,” added Mr Kemp. “It’s much easier to manage a small place, and you could very easily cordon off the whole island.“Besides that, the idea that there’s a very serious political conversation going to take place there also gives Sentosa the opportunity to show off a whole new element to its image.”And while hotels involved in the summit – whether host hotel Capella, or the hotels the foreign delegations will be staying at – will undoubtedly have their work cut out for them, hospitality experts noted that they will experience “priceless benefits”.“If you are good enough for the President of the United States, then you’re good enough for anyone,” said Kevin Wee, a senior lecturer in hospitality and tourism management at Nanyang Polytechnic.“Let’s say security-conscious billionaires want to book entire floors for their entourage,” he explained. “They might say that if Capella or Shangri-La have met the President’s needs, they should be able to meet your needs.”“This sort of branding is priceless, which is probably why they’re happy to go through all the work.”“Imagine the President is making a speech at the podium, and it has your hotel name and logo, and the façade of your hotel is on all the news broadcasts around the world,” added Revi Nair, a senior lecturer in hospitality and tourism management from Temasek Polytechnic.“The value of that kind of publicity can’t be measured.”The opportunity of hosting such an event also gives hotels the chance to put their culinary and banqueting skills on full display, added Mr Nair.“From choosing the local produce on the menu, to decorating the tables with subtle hints like an orchid here, or a Merlion there...hotels would not pass up the chance to showcase Singapore and their hotel.”Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b742e194719c855c40cfd88"},"header":"Trump-Kim summit: Singapore hosting a potential watershed moment in world history","time":null,"content":"SINGAPORE: A wavering possibility, rekindled by unexpected overtures, finally looks set for fruition.The highly anticipated tête-à-tête between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un on Tuesday (Jun 12) is on the brink of reality.For the first time, a sitting US President and a North Korean leader, representing two countries which have never seen eye to eye, will meet face to face, and the island nation of Singapore will host this historic event.Just weeks ago, when Kim and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in took a stroll in the border village of Panmunjom, the sun shined again over the peninsula as the neighbours engaged like old friends.The world watched.When state leaders convene, even simple gestures – be it a hesitant handshake or an exuberant embrace – are scrutinised from every angle.Every uttered word is recorded as analysts and journalists dissect the discourse in the days and weeks that follow. And of course, the dining that goes with the diplomacy becomes the subject of media interest too.In summary, summits are significant. And the one Singapore is prepared to host ranks among the biggest that have altered the course of history.Even the recent Korean summit had a precedent just 18 years ago. But one between a US and North Korean leader has always remained an unlikely prospect since the Americans left the unfinished Korean War.More than half a century of pent-up anger, sanctions, sabre-rattling and diatribes between 11 US administrations and three successive North Korean leaders, have stalled nuclear disarmament talks and exacerbated tensions across the globe.This precarious backdrop sets the scene for this once unimaginable summit. And it’s precisely why there is a desperate optimism in some quarters for a watershed moment, even as questions remain as to whether hot button issues like the Korean War and denuclearisation will be addressed.Writing for The National Interest, Robert E Kelly, associate professor of international relations at Pusan National University, described the summit as \"one of America's strangest meeting\" where he expected very little and yet hoped for the best.\"Indeed at this point, it looks to be a nothing burger of photos and short, ‘get to know you’ meetings that yield nothing. But, again, if this meeting must happen, then let America should (sic) pull for Trump given just how important the stakes. Prove your critics wrong, Mr President,\" he said.TURNING POINTSWhile meetings between leaders are regular features of international relations, few can be perceived as significant turning points in human history.Hark back to the height of the Cold War, and you come across one of the most unexpected summits to have taken place in the last hundred years – the meeting between US President Richard Nixon and his Chinese counterpart Mao Zedong in Beijing.The balance of world power underwent a tectonic shift, as the leaders from opposite sides of the political spectrum shook hands and shocked the world in February 1972.US rapprochement with the Chinese dealt the Soviets a rude awakening in their quest for dominance in the bipolar conflict. While there were other factors that led to the eventual Soviet downfall, Nixon’s visit to China arguably precipitated the beginning of the end of the Cold War, opened China to the rest of the world and helped in the normalisation of its relations with its adversary, Japan.“For East Asia, the last most important summit was probably the Nixon-Mao summit that changed the course of the Cold War,” associate professor Bhubhindar Singh, a Northeast Asia expert from the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Channel NewsAsia.The world would head in a different direction from that moment.Not long after that momentous occasion, still within the theatre of the Cold War, another memorable summit drew global attention.The famous Geneva fireside chat between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in November 1985 was another significant step towards ending the bitter conflict and the beginning of a temporary period of détente between the world powers.This meeting set the wheels in motion for subsequent summits between the two leaders, eventually paving the way for the end of the Cold War.Recent history has also recorded such unlikely get-togethers.The meeting between former US President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro just three years ago, was the first between an American and Cuban leader in half a century that quickly unlocked the doors to diplomatic ties.Later in the same year, the world turned its attention to Asia, and specifically Singapore.Shattering nearly seven-decades of tension, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou shook hands for almost a minute. Shifting in synchronised fashion from right to left for every camera flash to capture the historic moment, their smiles sustained throughout the handshake as a signal of solidarity.A watershed moment in cross-strait relations, said Chinese media, although hindsight might suggest otherwise. It was historic based on its symbolism, but not the impact it had on the future.That meeting, though, put Singapore under the global spotlight as host, bringing it valuable experience in the delicate task of accommodating leaders amid political sensitivities and security concerns that could have global ramifications. What the island nation is about to handle over the next few days is, however, a different ball game altogether, not just because of the potential for a turning point of global magnitude.Putting the historical element aside, the Trump-Kim summit draws undue attention simply because of the leaders themselves.The protracted antagonism between Washington and Pyongyang is well-documented and has consistently manifested itself in the exchanges and statements under various administrations and leaders.But the language has never been more colourful and undiplomatic – “little rocketman”, “dotard” and “short and fat” come to mind - even as US allies, Japan and South Korea observed the tit for tat with bated breath.However, the tense state of affairs was suddenly assuaged, partly by an inexplicable exchange of cordial letters over the course of a week. Suddenly, the interaction took a more measured tone - perhaps even presidential as some have observed.For now, it seems all is well and good.HOSTS OF HISTORYPreparations have been underway at frenetic pace with officials from both sides conducting high-level meetings and communicating directly with their Singaporean hosts.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis were crystal clear in their appreciation of Singapore’s efforts in hosting the summit when they met their counterparts.   Singapore’s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said many officials have commented that without Singapore, preparations for the summit “would not have progressed so far”. It’s a testament to the country’s increasingly critical role in global politics.Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan was succinct in describing the hosts sentiment during a working trip to Washington earlier in the week.\"Happy to play (its) part for world peace,\" he said, as he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton.Just before welcoming the two leaders on Sunday, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted how this historic meeting gives the country publicity.\"The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting, we did not ask for it ... it says something about Singapore relations with the parties ... and our standing in the international community,\" he said. When historic events take place, the cities that host them are entered into history as well. The most famous capitals and even the most obscure towns become synonymous with epoch-making moments.The Versailles Treaty that ended World War I, the Potsdam conference of World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement that laid the foundation for the global economic system, and just two years ago, the historic Paris Climate Agreement – all among examples of significant turning points, named and remembered after their hosts.Singapore’s place among them should not be determined by the outcome of this summit, one could argue, as questions remain as to whether the meeting between Trump and Kim will be a watershed moment.“For Kim, this meeting is important for several reasons: To gain legitimacy for himself and his country. This meeting is also important for North Korea as it is in negotiation talks with the most important threat to its regime and national security,\" associate professor Bhubhindar Singh said.“For Trump, this meeting is to show his ability to ‘resolve’ the most difficult issue that other American administrations have failed to achieve. In more strategic terms, a deal here would reinforce America’s advantage and military presence in Northeast Asia vis-à-vis China.\"Some believe this could be just the start of a long drawn out process, especially in the sphere of denuclearisation.\"Kim is focused on the long game. If talks go forward after June, their differences over denuclearising Korea obviously won’t be resolved in a day,\" wrote Kent Harrington, a former CIA senior analyst, in a commentary.Will the summit mirror the impact of the Nixon-Mao meeting? Or will it begin a process of détente as did the famous fireside chat? Will it quickly open doors to diplomatic ties? Or simply be written as an inconsequential historic event, as was the Xi-Ma meeting?All we know for now is that the magnitude of what’s at stake cannot be overstated: The demands for North Korea’s denuclearisation, the possibility of ending the Korean War and normalising relations on the Korean Peninsula, and the impact of all this on the region and the rest of the world.The scheduled meeting between two eccentric world leaders, with the baggage of the past and present in tow, will draw all the attention from across the globe. Journalists and officials have already descended on the island in the thousands, casting a blinding spotlight on this tiny Southeast Asian country.According to associate professor Bhubhindar Singh: “The selection of Singapore says a lot of who Singapore is – an efficient, honest, neutral country that can be trusted to hold such an important summit.”Singapore – known for its efficiency, infrastructure and organisational competency – has to pull out all the stops for this one.  It’s a mammoth task to be executed within a tight schedule.The world awaits the Singapore Summit on Jun 12, 2018.  Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a first, historic summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un conducted a comprehensive, in-depth, and sincere exchange of opinions on the issues related to the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations and the building of a lasting and robust peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK, and Chairman Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.Convinced that the establishment of new U.S.-DPRK relations will contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and of the world, and recognizing that mutual confidence building can promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un state the following:1. The United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.2. The United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.3. Reaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.4. The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.Having acknowledged that the U.S.-DPRK summit - the first in history - was an epochal event of great significance and overcoming decades of tensions and hostilities between the two countries and for the opening of a new future, President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un commit to implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously. The United States and the DPRK commit to hold follow-on negotiations led by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a relevant high-level DPRK official, at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes of the U.S.-DPRK summit.President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have committed to cooperate for the development of new U.S.-DPRK relations and for the promotion of peace, prosperity, and security of the Korean Peninsula and of the world.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/full-joint-statement-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-singapore-summit-10423446","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:31:40.902Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

So for all of those reasons in our own usual Singapore way, we've taken every precaution possible. And our police, our Home Team, our military, everything is deployed and ready,\" he said in an interview with BBC.Earlier on Monday, Dr Balakrishnan was part of the Singapore delegation led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that hosted US President Donald Trump and other officials to a working lunch at the Istana. Prior to that, both Mr Lee and Mr Trump had a one-on-one bilateral meeting. On Sunday, Mr Lee also met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Istana, after he was received at the Changi Airport by Dr Balakrishnan. Mr Trump and Mr Kim are set to meet on Tuesday at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island. A SENSE OF \"REALISTIC OPTIMISM\"And while both leaders have tried to manage expectations that the meeting is just the first step towards getting North Korea to agree to denuclearise on terms that are acceptable to all parties, Dr Balakrishnan said there is a sense of realistic optimism in the air.\"Well, what we are witnessing, really, is a hangover of the Cold War, and it has been nearly 70 years,\" he said.\"This is not the way conventional diplomacy would have been conducted, but perhaps you need two very unconventional leaders to have brought us to this stage. \"So, it’s based on my interactions with their staff, as well as meeting them personally up front - both are supremely confident, both are hopeful. I think at an emotional level, both of them want something significant out of this summit.\"But can the world trust Kim, that he is committed to denuclearisation and ending the Korean War?Dr Balakrishnan said: \"My sense of it is that there is a real desire for change. He said that he now wants to focus on economic development. \"And having had the advantage of actually visiting Pyongyang, and actually seeing how much they have been able to achieve despite the legacy of the war and the sanctions, there is no doubt that the North Koreans are a determined, proud, enterprising, disciplined people. \"And that is why I left with that sense, supposing they were allowed to participate as a normal country, open up to the world, access the technology through trade, there is so much that they could do. So I think that he is also working on that hope that this is a new phase, a new opportunity.\"\"ENORMOUS STRATEGIC IMPACT\"Hosting the summit is set to cost around S$20 million, which Dr Balakrishnan described as an \"investment in world peace\".\"The big difference between them and us is that Southeast Asia, particularly for the original members of ASEAN, which you must remember, was formed in 1967 at the height of the Cold War and Vietnam War, is that we had peace, we had time to prove that economic openness, integration, globalisation, free trade, worked,\" he said. \"In a sense, Singapore is the ultimate example of that paradigm. Now if you can secure peace and development in North Korea, and if you can dial down the tensions which have prevailed there for seven decades, it is going to have an enormous strategic impact.\"Dr Balakrishnan also confirmed that Singapore is footing the bill for Mr Kim's stay at the St Regis hotel. \"Well, it’s hospitality that I would have provided for him anyway,\" Dr Balakrishnan said. \"And it’s all within the budget that the Prime Minister has specified, anyway.\"Watch our comprehensive coverage of the Trump-Kim summit live on YouTube from 7am on Tuesday (Jun 12).

Accomplishing this objective, even with Kim’s unlikely agreement, would take more than a decade, according to US nuclear experts.That makes the Singapore summit much more relevant as a ballast for Kim’s dynastic rule. He has accomplished what neither his father nor his grandfather, the state founder, could achieve.READ: Trump-Kim summit is a win regardless what happens next. A commentary.READ: A commentary on how Kim Jong Un may have outmanoeuvred Donald Trump in Singapore. READ: US-North Korea summit ends without marquee achievement, but wasn't a waste, a commentary.His major challenge now is to use arms-control negotiations to bargain for economic aid, without sacrificing the integrity of his weapons capability. The United States and South Korea, targets of the North’s nuclear arsenal, can only hope that a vision of peace and prosperity would entice Kim to choose a rational way out of the crisis for survival.As for rest of the world, it has added a ninth nuclear state, equipped with intercontinental ballistic capability and therefore much more dangerous than Pakistan.Pakistani nuclear black marketeer Abdul Qadeer Khan helped Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions by providing bomb designs and centrifuge technology.The thermonuclear device North Korea exploded last September was 15 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima and theoretically could be carried by the Hwasong-15 ICBM, tested in November, to targets within an estimated range of 10,000km.Trump may have awakened to the reality, apparent to analysts for decades, that defanging the Pyongyang regime risks starting a new war on the Korean Peninsula with casualties running into millions of people on both sides of the border.DIPLOMATIC FIASCOFor all that, Trump’s amateurish talks in Singapore have brought diplomatic fiasco.A four-point joint statement issued at the end of the summit was vacuous, containing no detailed roadmaps leading to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation, the so-called CVID formula pushed by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hours before the summit’s opening.The joint statement, while talking about building a lasting peace regime and establishing new relations, merely repeated Kim’s commitment to “work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,” a largely empty phrase devoid of details or binding clause. The bland expression was described as “reaffirmation” of Kim’s earlier declaration signed at Panmunjom at separate talks in April with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. No mention was made of the North’s aggressive missile programme.The statement amounted to an astonishing retreat for Trump who came to Singapore vowing he would “walk out” of the conference if Kim showed any sign of rejecting the CVID formula.With Kim’s negotiators adamantly refusing to accept the denuclearisation timetable, Trump was pushed into the corner of either cancelling the talks and walking away, as he had threatened, or swallowing his pride. Surprisingly, Trump buckled, turning the talks into a show-business event, not a summit of war and peace.Trump’s inept diplomacy exhibited his lack of preparation and haphazardness. When talks got tough, Trump folded.Inexplicably, he offered to suspend US–South Korean military exercises while negotiations were underway. He threw away a major bargaining chip without reciprocal concessions. The military exercises, held three times a year for the past two decades, have sent a powerful message to the North that they can expect a robust counterattack in case of invasion.Later in the middle of a rambling news conference summing up the talks, Trump justified suspension of war games in the name of economy; like North Korea, he called them “provocative” and “expensive” to boot. He delivered more shocks by suggesting he may eventually withdraw 28,500 US ground troops from South Korea, another demand pushed by the North since the 1953 signing of the armistice.The unexpected statements dropped like thunder strikes on Seoul, where the government fights a conservative opposition campaign against Moon’s rapprochement policy with the North. The Korean currency’s value dropped to 1,097 won to the US dollar, as much as three per cent, after the summit.To calm market nerves in Seoul, Moon issued a statement that the matter of US forces in Korea is strictly bilateral between Seoul and Washington, thus separate from the North Korean nuclear issue.JAPANESE REACTIONS BORDERED ON PANICReactions in Tokyo bordered on panic as removal of US forces would make Japan the first line of defence in a potential war with the North or even China.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has held three sets of talks with Trump so far, each time advising a tough stance on Kim, was so shaken that he hurriedly asked Seoul and others to help arrange a summit with Kim for himself.Cancellation of military exercises has direct bearing on Japan’s security interests as the Japanese Navy sometimes participates in these exercises, and Tokyo has vital intelligence-sharing deals with both Seoul and Washington.The Kim regime has already lobbed missiles over Japan’s skies during test launches that Tokyo citizens are getting used to hearing emergency sirens urging them to seek shelter during missile tests.Reactions in Beijing, Kim’s main source of support, were of quiet elation.China emerged as the biggest beneficiary from Trump’s new East Asian geopolitical vision that appeared destined to remove the United States as the security linchpin in the Western Pacific.China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the joint statement showed that China’s formula of “freeze for freeze” was correct, referring to his proposal calling for the US to reward Kim’s nuclear and missile moratorium with suspension of US-Korean military exercises, and responding to Pyongyang’s denuclearisation with regime security and a peace accord.CONFUSION OVER THE MEANING OF DENUCLEARISATION In this maelstrom of terrible initiatives, Washington’s confusion over Kim’s nuclear challenge isn’t expected to end soon.Pompeo, visiting Seoul and Beijing on summit briefing tours, reportedly said he expected Kim to complete his denuclearisation process – a huge undertaking requiring locating more than 100 secret sites related to bomb-making operations – in 30 months.The timeframe was presumably calculated to match the timetable for Trump’s re-election campaign.Leading nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker of Los Alamos National Laboratory, who visited North Korean nuclear sites several times estimates that completing the disarmament process would require up to 15 years.Days after the summit, the Kim regime insisted it was sticking to its own formula of “phased and synchronous” denuclearisation – a process of the United States matching every step of the North’s denuclearisation with political and economic rewards.Indeed, the North’s state media have begun spelling out what the goal of “denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” means.According to Choson Sinbo, Pyongyang’s propaganda voice published in Tokyo, the formula includes as an essential condition the removal of American troops and termination of US strategic commitments providing “extended nuclear coverage” or a “nuclear umbrella” for South Korea and maybe Japan as well.Ultimately, this formula is unacceptable to the United States, South Korea or even Japan as it would mean curtailing the US's superpower role responsible for keeping Asia’s peace – a tall order indeed even if it comes from Kim Jong Un.Shim Jae Hoon is a journalist based in Seoul.

Mr Lee had described the amount spent as Singapore's \"contribution to an international endeavour which is in our profound interest\".Hosting the meeting was largely seen as a public relations coup for Singapore, with more than 2,500 journalists on the island reporting on the landmark event.The Jun 12 meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the Capella hotel on Sentosa culminated in the North Korean leader reaffirming his \"firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\".This was stated in a joint document signed by Mr Trump and Mr Kim.Since then, the US and South Korea have suspended two military exercises, following president Trump's promise at the summit to halt the war games between the two countries.But senior US officials admit there is much work to be done as negotiators thrash out the details of what they hope will be Pyongyang's \"complete, verifiable and irreversible\" disarmament.Mr Trump's administration last Friday extended decade-old sanctions against Mr Kim's regime, citing an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" from North Korea's nuclear arsenal.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hosting-trump-kim-summit-cost-s-16-3-million-security-the-10464348","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:32:59.544Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

Discover the Spectacular Labuan BajoAYANA Komodo Resort","content":"By giving a specific time of day - 9 am - for the June 12 summit with Kim Jong-un, it appears the White House has every intent of following through on the historic summit.However impulsive US President Donald Trump was when he first agreed to the meeting in early March, he has now come to realize the long-anticipated Singapore one-on-one with the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is just the start of a \"process\", meaning rapid denuclearization is unlikely.That is a plausible statement, as was Trump's offer on Friday to put new sanctions against the DPRK on hold.Trump made the comments when he was asked if the DPRK agreed to CVID - complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement.\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\" Trump said on Friday, in a clear downplaying of expectations for a summit that he had abruptly canceled a few days before. \"We're going to start a process but I think they'd like to see something happen.\"Shortly after his meeting with Kim Yong-chol, vice-chairman of the DPRK's ruling Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, Trump also told reporters that he was putting new sanctions against the DPRK on hold and doesn't want to use the term \"maximum pressure\" anymore.\"We're getting along, so it's not a question of maximum pressure,\" Trump said. \"And at a certain point, I'll tell you what, I look forward to the day when I can take the sanctions off of North Korea.\"A day before his meeting with the DPRK envoy, Trump had said it could take several meetings to reach an agreement.In Pyongyang on Friday, the official KCNA news agency reported that Kim Jong-un hoped US-DPRK relations and denuclearization of the peninsula will be addressed on a \"stage-by-stage\" basis.After the turbulence and drama surrounding the on-again, off-again meeting, it is perhaps safe to say that the two leaders are now on the same page in at least one area - there is no quick fix to denuclearization.That is important, because realizing that denuclearizing takes time will make people more rational when it comes to what to expect from the first Trump-Kim meeting days before it opens. It also allows deliberation about what steps to take prior to the summit and during the critical period afterward.On Monday, top Democrats in the US Senate told Trump not to make a deal that leaves the DPRK with nuclear weapons. They threatened to maintain or toughen sanctions on Pyongyang if that condition were not met.The White House also said on Monday that \"powerful sanctions\" will continue unless the DPRK denuclearized.Because denuclearization faces a long and bumpy road, it is time to think which is a better approach, an easing of sanctions only after full denuclearization, or having the DPRK getting step-by-step benefits in the course?Over recent weeks, Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, demolished a nuclear test site, released three American prisoners and conducted a second summit meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.Trump's offer of holding off on imposing new sanctions is a good gesture.Mindful of the long-term goal and the effort to achieve it, it is important for both countries to continue meeting each other halfway, with sincerity, so that they can achieve what they and the international community hope for.Their efforts could ultimately usher in a new era for the peninsula, one of denuclearization, peace and prosperity.Contact the writer at huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com(China Daily USA 06/05/2018 page2) \nEnglish|中文\n","url":"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201806/05/WS5b16b2bea31001b82571e52e.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:39:51.944Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

That makes Russia the hinge of the whole grouping, though the most powerful state represented in Ufa and the one that is busy forging the new economic linkages via the BRICS and the Silk Road initiatives that will underpin the whole emerging system is China.What we are seeing in Ufa is the coalescing of the new power centre that is challenging the historic hegemony of the US and the European states.At its core is the alliance (or “strategic partnership”) of China and Russia, who are now busy forging a full spectrum relationship with each other covering all aspects of their relations: political, diplomatic, economic and military.Coalescing around this core are the Eurasian states (including Belarus and Iran) who are being drawn into a Eurasian system that integrates them politically, militarily and economically with the core. These together with the Russian-Chinese core will form the Eurasian heartland.Beyond the heartland there is a group of other states linked to the heartland by a web of political, economic and security linkages.  Of these the giants are India, Pakistan and Brazil.The key security organisation is the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.  The key economic organisation is the BRICS, now being underpinned by the new financial institutions being forged by China.  The inner political grouping will be the Eurasian Union of which China --- via its alliance with Russia --- is a not so secret partner. The economic and trade linkages tying together the Eurasian heartland are the Eurasian Union and the Silk Road.Whilst the West seems incapable of resolving a crisis in little Greece, in Ufa a new world is being made.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Their mass-migration project of recent years hasn’t been a humane endeavour to improve the lives of foreign peoples; it has been about further erasing borders, using migrant flows effectively as a tool to push the EU oligarchy’s post-nation agenda. This article originally appeared on a new site about the Christian renaissance in Russia, called Russian Faith. Their introductory video is at end of this article.Go Vikings!The British military which has inserted itself into Syria illegally and against the wishes of its internationally recognized government bombed and killed the soldiers of said government as reported by The Sunday Times citing a spokesman for the British Defence Ministry.The British Defence Ministry says a British Eurofighter jet dropped a 250 kilogram bomb on Syrian troops when a desert battle erupted near the British-American-rebel base in Al-Tanf in Syria:I can’t remember a time when the refrain “left-wing anti-Semitism” was more in vogue and yet so woefully misused. A quick Google search for the phrase returns more than four million results, including 65,000 results in which discussion of alleged leftist anti-Semitism forms a substantial element of a book.He's on a roll.There’s never a dull moment with the Trump administration, which means: never a moment of rest for the War Party. Trump keeps throwing fast balls at the pundits and assembled “experts,” and they keep striking out, bigtime, as the ball whizzes past their heads and lands, with a thwack!, in the catcher’s mitt.“Steee-rike one!”Given the growing religious/political divide in the United States, a poll taken by Pew is particularly pertinent, especially given the recent activities in Israel and the Gaza.  Show your support by disabling ad-block (How)Buy AD-FREE ACCESS here, for only $19 / yrThanks for your supportWe’re winning thanks to YOU!Disabling adblock for a specific site just takes a couple of clicks.Usually it is as simple as clicking on the adblock icon in your browser, and choosing the ‘disable on this page or domain’ option.If that doesn’t work this wikihow article gives more detail:  https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-AdBlockThank you for your support!(more info) Join us! | About | Contact | Investors | Crowdfunding | RSS\n\n","url":"https://russia-insider.com/en/frontpage?page%5Cu003d857%5Cu003d%5Cu0026page%5Cu003d781=\u0026page=56","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:45:53.360Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

He moved to the US as a child, and lives in the Boston area.This is essentially a short history of the 20th century from the point of view of HBD realism and the maxim that “population is power.”This century turned out to be an “American Century.”But it wasn’t obvious that it was going to be that way – while the United States was almost predestined to play a primary role, several other countries – primarily, Germany and Russia – had the potential to emerge as true peer competitors. And China took a surprisingly long time to emerge out of its slumber.Why did things turn out the way they did?***The Washington Post continues to push BS conspiracy theories that Russia helped President Trump win the 2016 election.There is no proof to back up this conspiracy, that was originally pushed by the Clinton campaign and Obama administration, back in 2016.Russia’s energy ties to China have been discussed at length throughout our website – the construction of the 38 BCm per year Power of Siberia gas pipeline, seaborne sales of ESPO (of which China is the dominant buyer), recent cross-investment deals including Rosneft and many more. With the two as close as ever on geopolitical and energy-related issues, July 2018 brought about a new facet to their cooperation – trading in Yamal LNG cargoes.US designs in Syria were made crystal clear by US Army General Joseph Votel – head of US Central Command (CENTCOM) – during a July 19th press briefing.General Votel would state unequivocally when asked what the “arrangement” was regarding Syria, that:Our mission is very, very clear: It is focusing on the defeat of ISIS and then helping our partners in both Iraq and Syria stabilize the situation and specifically in Iraq to help create a platform that can lead to a long-term political solution through the U.N. process.Bulgaria opened a new looping section of its transit gas pipeline to Turkey on Friday, expanding its capacity and adding the possibility of two-way flows as the Balkan country bids to transport Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to Europe.The new 20-km looping link in southeastern Bulgaria will boost the Transbalkan pipeline’s capacity to 15.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year from its current 14 bcm, and will help increase security of gas supplies, officials said.You can always count on the neocons in Congress to ignore reality, ignore evidence, and ignore common sense in their endless drive to get us involved in another war. Last week, for example, Senators John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-NC), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and others joined up to introduce what Senator Graham called “the sanctions bill from hell,” aimed at applying “crushing” sanctions on Russia.\nSenator Graham bragged that the bill would include “everything but the kitchen sink” in its attempt to ratchet up tensions with Russia.It is no secret that South Africa’s current president is neither a fan of BRICS nor of Russia.Ramaphosa’s predecessor Jacob Zuma had a warm relationship with Putin and in 2014 spent six days in Russia, to recover from an attempt to poison him in which Ramaphosa was implicated.Show your support by disabling ad-block (How)Buy AD-FREE ACCESS here, for only $19 / yrThanks for your supportWe’re winning thanks to YOU!Disabling adblock for a specific site just takes a couple of clicks.Usually it is as simple as clicking on the adblock icon in your browser, and choosing the ‘disable on this page or domain’ option.If that doesn’t work this wikihow article gives more detail:  https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-AdBlockThank you for your support!(more info) Join us! | About | Contact | Investors | Crowdfunding | RSS\n\n","url":"https://russia-insider.com/en/frontpage?page%5Cu003d857%5Cu003d%5Cu0026page%5Cu003d516=\u0026page=22","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:46:36.151Z"},"parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77c92d4719c85521657307"},"header":"The Syrian ‘hell on earth’ is a tangle of power plays unlikely to end soon","time":"March 5, 201810:06am","content":"THE war in Syria has killed more than 400,000 people and displaced millions, but there is a reason why the fighting won’t end soon.A Russian call for a five-hour truce has failed to halt one of the most devastating campaigns of the Syrian war.\n\nResidents say government warplanes resumed striking the eastern Ghouta region after a brief lull.ONCE again, unfortunate civilians are trapped in the “hell on earth” that the Syrian civil war has become. This time it is the turn of the 400,000 residents of Eastern Ghouta, 10km east of the capital Damascus. Latest reports put civilian casualties at 520 and thousands wounded under the heavy assault launched by President Bashar al-Assad’s ground forces supported by Russian air strikes.It seems conditions in Syria are getting worse, and there is no end to the conflict.The end to any violent conflict comes when either the warring sides realise the devastation they cause and make peace; outside intervention sways the warring parties to end the conflict; or there are clear winners delivering a crushing defeat to their enemies.None of the warring factions seem to care about the devastation of the seven-year civil war. Almost the entire country is rubble — more than 400,000 people have died, there are 5 million Syrian refugees and more than 6 million displaced. Unfortunately, the peace option seems highly unlikely.There had been international intervention through peace initiatives since 2013, when the then US Secretary of State, John Kerry, lamented that Syria “heads closer to an abyss, if not over the abyss and into chaos”. It was a chemical attack in Eastern Ghouta that prompted the United Nations to pass a resolution in 2013 demanding the destruction of chemical stockpiles and giving impetus to peace talks in Geneva. All efforts to make progress on these talks were continually stalled. The parties failed to meet even as late as 2017, painfully expediting Mr Kerry’s apocalyptic prediction.The Geneva talks were paralleled by a Russian-led peace initiative in Kazakhstan and later in Sochi. These talks could not have been expected to succeed, given that Russia’s unconditional and active support of the Assad regime hampered any attempt at negotiating a peace deal.Apart from the vested interests and insincerity, the biggest stumbling block has been disagreement over who to include in the peace process.The US does not want Mr Assad or Iran involved; Turkey does not want the Kurdish People’s Defence Unit (YPG); and Russia does not want any of the jihadist rebel groups.The sheer number of rebel groups is another issue. In the relatively small area of Eastern Ghouta alone, there are three rebel groups, which often bicker with one another.Since the conflict began in 2011, nearly 200 separate rebel groups have sporadically emerged. Although most of these later merged into larger entities, there are still too many groups. Their inclusion in any peace process has been problematic, because it is unclear who actually represents the Syrian opposition, not to mention the groups’ refusal to sit at the same table.Then there is the thorny issue of ideological and religious differences. Shiite Syrians and a segment of secular Sunni Muslims support the Assad regime, whereas the largest chunk of the rebel groups are Salafi jihadists. The exceptions are the Kurdish YPG and the largely weakened Free Syrian Army.All along, Mr Assad’s regime has been claiming it is fighting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other Salafi jihadist groups to keep Syria a modern secular state. Mr Putin is pushing Mr Assad to wipe out these groups, spurred by the deep fear they could mobilise radical Muslim groups within Russia’s borders.The US and Europe are in the cognitive dissonance of wanting neither Mr Assad nor jihadist groups to gain control in Syria. They don’t want Mr Assad, but they like his argument of protecting a modern secular Syria. The unspoken preference is for Mr Assad over any Jihadi rebel group.So, the lack of an effective peace intervention and the impossibility of parties sitting down to negotiate, leaves only the option of fighting it out until clear victors emerge.This leaves the Assad regime with a free run to assert itself as the only feasible and legitimate government in Syria, a possibility that may indeed eventuate.This is the strategic line the Assad regime has drawn thick on the ground. It explains why Assad forces have ignored the UN’s 30-day ceasefire resolution. Mr Putin’s disregard for the resolution, by reducing it to a farcical five-hour window, shows that neither Mr Assad nor Mr Putin wants the rebels to regroup and gain strength. They want a quick and absolute victory, even if it is a bloodbath.Just as it is almost certain that the rebels of Eastern Ghouta will fall, it is equally certain Assad forces will next intensify the siege of Idlib, a north-eastern city held by the Salafi jihadist rebel group Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This pattern will continue until all rebel groups are wiped out.It is unlikely there will be any fighting between Assad forces and the Kurdish YPG, as that would mean an open confrontation between Russia and the US. After the US supported the YPG, it successfully ended Islamic State’s presence in eastern Syria.The US has made it clear it is there to stay, establishing a 30,000-strong border security force as a deterrent against IS regrouping, but more importantly to stop Mr Assad attacking Kurdish regions once he clears the ground of rebel groups in his territory.The wildcard in Syria is Turkey’s unpredictable president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He aims to establish Turkey in north-eastern Syria as a third major player along with Russia and the US, by fighting alongside elements of the Free Syrian Army to capture the Kurdish-controlled district of Afrin.Whether Russia and the US will allow Mr Erdogan to realise his objectives remains to be seen. He may find he is out of his league when things get tough on the ground, forcing him out of Syria.The Syrian conflict will end only if the Russian-supported Assad regime wipes out all Salafi jihadist rebel groups and regains control of western Syria and its most important cities. This may be before the end of 2018. In the meantime, the international community should be prepared to lament more civilian casualties.Mehmet Ozalp is an Associate Professor in Islamic Studies, Director of The Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation and Executive Member of Public and Contextual Theology, Charles Sturt UniversityThis story originally appeared in The Conversation and has been republished here with permission.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Kurdish officials said the suicide bomber drove into a busy checkpoint. Photo: Getty ImagesTHIS is a complicated war. This is a messy, cruel war where neither side has much regard for civilian casualties.This war is not black-and-white. You might think it’s the brave rebels versus the evil dictatorial regime, and that’s part of the story. But it’s not all of it. Not by a long way.Confused about Syria? Us too. But this quick 10-point explainer will help. To help us navigate this tragic conflict, we spoke to two Australians with a unique view on the troubled nation.We spoke to Dr Rodger Shanahan, former peacekeeper in Syria and non-resident Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy.And we spoke to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who this year travelled to Syria on a humanitarian mission. You can read his blog here at prayersforsyria.com.1. SyriaA country smaller than the state of Victoria with almost the exact same population as Australia (22.5 million to our 23 million) which borders Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon. Syria has both deserts and fertile areas and is steeped in history dating back to biblical times.2. The Syrian regimeThe Syrian Civil war is a conflict between its long-serving government and those seeking to boot it out of office. The Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar al-Assad.Unlike many regime leaders in the middle east middle, The Assad family is not religiously extreme. They are Alawites – a relatively obscure branch of Islam which is not particularly hard-line. So the people have not been protesting against hard-line Islamists, as happened in other countries which participated in the Arab Spring uprisings.But people are still angry at their government. As Rodger Shanahan points out, what they’re angry about is the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms.3. The Civil War beginsRodger Shanahan says the catalyst was the jailing on March 6, 2011, of some children who painted anti-regime graffiti. Some were killed in detention, and this led to public protests which spread around the country – fuelled by the failure of the government to punish the perpetrators.Another theory says the war started with demonstrations which mirrored those in neighbouring countries, and which soon led to a security crackdown. In April 2011, the Syrian Army fired on demonstrators and the protests became a full-scale armed rebellion.4. The rebellion grows…By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed. As Dr Shanahan explains, the FSA never existed before that. “Local areas formed their own militias with the aim of toppling the government without any co-ordination or centralised command or control,” he says.“The militias were a combination of local area tribal groups, deserters from the military [who had been conscripted despite holding anti-government beliefs] and disaffected locals.”Then a combination of Jihadists, some from Syria and some from elsewhere, joined the FSA. Some even came from the faraway Caucasus region – where accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev originally hailed from.So in other words, you had genuine Syrian freedom fighters joined by people with their own Islamist agendas. But because the FSA was underarmed and undermanned, they had little choice but to form a loose coalition with these volatile new kids on the revolutionary block.5. And pretty soon, bad guys on both sides are killing civilians…As Father Dave Smith says, “the way it’s been depicted the last couple of years, you get the impression the rebels are Robin Hood and his band of merry men, and that all they want is freedom and justice for all. But that couldn’t be further from the truth.”Father Dave illustrates his point with a communication he had with a Syrian woman which he published on his blog. The woman’s name is Ghinwa and she wrote by text:“The situation is very bad now in Latakia province. 7 Alawite villages were massacred. We know about the killing of 136 villagers all killed on sectarian bases. A friend of mind lost 21 member of his relatives.“All of my friends who were documenting the name and the events of massacres in Latakia against Alawites are now being threatened to be killed by FSA and Al Nusra terrorists … On TV we are shown something different. It is only a propaganda. They’re trying to say that Alawites are not being killed or displaced. The truth is being hidden by mass media. .. This is sick… My sister now is very ill … I guess a part of her illness is caused by sadness … we are afraid.”A quick recap. Alawites are the ethnicity of the ruling family. The fact they were allegedly being killed by rebel groups suggests the rebels are not all angels.6. Civilian casualties“There are accusations of atrocities on both sides,” Rodger Shanahan confirms. We should believe some of them, absolutely. There’s no accurate confirmation, but it’s a nasty horrible civil war with people on both sides getting killed.Dr Shanahan says there is evidence that opposition car bombs have killed countless civilians in the name of taking out a government target. But there are equally distressing reports that government soldiers executed civilians. Others, shockingly, were executed for taking a moral stance and failing to follow orders to execute civilians.Like we said, it’s a bloody mess. Literally. The death toll in the war is now said to be well over 100,000.7. The president’s wifeAllow us to break up this tale with a story of the president’s wife. Her name is Asma al-Assad and she was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. She’s smart, glamorous and she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 – just months before he became president.In March 2011, the American version of Vogue magazine ran a long, glowing profile of Asma al-Assad. Talk about bad timing. The story was soon removed from Vogue’s website and the journalist who wrote it tried to cover her tracks by penning a separate story elsewhere entitled “First Lady of Hell”.Even as the Civil war rages, the Assad family remains popular with many middle class Syrians, especially urbanised Sunni Muslims, says Dr Rodger Shanahan. “They still prefer him to the opposition,” he says.8. Refugee hellThe United Nations estimates that more than 1.5 million refugees have now fled Syria. Father David Smith visited several camps across the border in Lebanon – a country whose population of 4.3 million is bulging with the influx of a total of nearly 2 million Palestinian and Syrian refugees.“The camps I saw were deeply impressive,” Father Dave says. “Every Palestinian family took in two, maybe three Syrian families. These included polygamous families which presented a whole new problem. The wives often lived in separate houses in Syria but now they were not just under the same roof but sleeping on the same floor. The domestic violence and rape problems are enormous. I was deeply impressed with camp and people running it.”9. Chemical weaponsJust who unleashed the chemical weapons attack which killed hundreds of children and other civilians last week – and why? UN weapons inspectors arrived yesterday with a mandate to find that out. And when they do, it will affect what the world does next.“They have a mandate to say whether a chemical attack occurred but not to apportion blame,” Dr Shanahan cautions. “First, they have to establish whether an incident occurred [it is still disputed by some] and at what level the action was authorised. It is plausible that Assad didn’t authorise it but a local commander did.”10. What happens nextThe world waits. “You would think the way diplomatic manoeuvrings are going that if there is some kind of military strike it would be quite limited,” Dr Shanahan says. “It would be punitive, not designed to tip the military balance.”In other words, no Iraq-style invasion or prolonged Western intervention.And Father Dave’s opinion of what comes next? He doesn’t know. But he’s praying. He speaks of a man he met in Syria who said he’s gone “from unemployment to slavery”. That’s his way of saying the revolution has so far achieved a whole bunch of nothing except bloodshed and dislocation.“I see the faces of all those beautiful people and I pray,” he says.Continue the conversation @antsharwood@newscomauHQ@GhinwaMaia@fatherdaveNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Now the world awaits Bashar al-Assad’s next move.THE brutal dictator behind one of the worst atrocities the world has seen this century got the job by accident. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine.But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career.Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade.When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded.But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants.ACCIDENTAL RULERThe al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father’s death.According to the Lowy Institute’s Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change.“He had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,” Dr Shanahan said.But that didn’t happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region.Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government.“You can’t open up free speech in a closed political system,” he said.GLAMOROUS MODERN WIFEAsma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 — just months before he became president.From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial — the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni.As Syria’s First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women’s rights and education.The couple have three children.RISE OF A DICTATORAssad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists.But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent.One of Assad’s first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reformsBut the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving.Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands.A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed.The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad’s Ba’ath Party holding effective power.The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied.Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013.Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria.The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province.SPARKING A WARThe Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam.While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school.Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad’s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.REBELS OR ISLAMIC STATE?Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra.And the messy, long and complicated war isn’t just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot actually.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city.But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHAT DOES THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL?The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib.The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces.IS ASSAD LIKED?Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask.Domestically he’s generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments.Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him.But millions of others have suffered.Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries.But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war.Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey.“Iraqis have remained neutral with their support of Assad.” Dr Shanahan said.“Jordanians just wish it would all go away and Lebanon have always had a funny stance with Syria.“The Gulf states oppose Assad.”WILL HE LOSE POWER?Dr Shanahan said the Gulf States have been pressuring Assad to step down for years and that hasn’t worked.However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story.“The US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don’t see this situation changing anytime soon,” he said.debra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

But the before and after photos are pretty hard to forget.We take a look at how Syria and the city Aleppo has change over the last six years with the conflict of war.ONCE regarded as a political and military heavyweight in the Middle East, this country was rich in trade, ancient archaeological sites and boasted an innovative IT industry.Today, its cities and towns are in pieces and the war in Syria has become the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.With more than 300,000 Syrians killed and six million people who have fled or displaced, the war in Syria was last night described on Q\u0026A as “the biggest story on the planet”. Host Tony Jones said “we rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people”.Syria descended into full-scale civil war in 2012, causing about half the country’s pre-war population to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadists.And while the world now sees a country devastated by years of war and left in ruins, it wasn’t always this way.Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt told Q\u0026A that Syria was “quite a normal country” eight years ago.He’s not the only one, many people remember a country that was once thriving.One refugee Tara, who fled Syria in 2011, told Amnesty International her country had one of the oldest and sophisticated literary traditions in the world along with a vibrant film industry.She also revealed how Syria has been part of the major empires of history, including Egyptian, Persian and Roman.Syria’s cities were filled with souks and bustling marketplaces which served as a crucial meeting and cultural point while bakeries and sweet shops were found on most corners.Today Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, has all but been obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Once the beating heart of Syria’s industrial and commercial industries, it has witnessed some of the most brutal violence of the country’s six-year war.Before and after photos of the Old City of Aleppo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, show the full extent of the catastrophic destruction which has taken place.Aleppo was pummelled by air strikes last December, shrinking the rebel enclave just days ahead of parallel talks in France and Switzerland which aimed to save the Syrian city from “complete” destruction.The city’s east — a rebel stronghold since 2012 — has been the target of a major assault by forces loyal to President Bashar’s Russian-backed regime.During last December’s air strikes, Ibrahim Abu al-Leith, spokesman for the White Helmets rescue force inside Aleppo described the terror many left behind faced.“The streets are full of people under the rubble. They are dying because we can’t get them out,” he told AFP.As news.com.au reported last December, the war in Syria has been described as the deadliest conflict of the 21st century.While the Syrian army announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26, the conflict is far from over.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

A Western perspective on the crisis","time":"September 9, 20155:06pm","content":"AS DESPERATE people flee in their millions, Australia is launching headlong into this hell on Earth. This is what they are running from.ALMOST exactly two years ago, as the full horror of Syria’s civil war revealed itself to the world, news.com.au published a basic explainer piece.That piece, entitled 10 simple points to help you understand the Syria conflict, went on to be one of the most clicked stories ever produced by this website.To this day, people continue to read it. At any given moment in the day or night, 40 or 50 people from around the world are reading it as they try to comprehend the desperately complicated Syrian situation. Those numbers have surged in recent days and weeks for obvious reasons.But our original piece is now out of date. So much has happened since 2013, including this afternoon’s announcement that Australia will carry out air strikes against Islamic State (IS).That’s why we’ve produced this update, with fresh comment from the same two Australian experts we consulted two years ago.We’ve again spoken to Dr Rodger Shanahan, a former peacekeeper in Syria who is now a Research Fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, as well as Associate Professor at the National Security College at the Australian National University (ANU).And we spoke once more to Father David Smith, a Sydney Anglican priest who has now made four humanitarian missions to Syria, the most recent in July. You can read Father Dave’s blog here at prayersforsyria.com1. A reminder of Syria and its origins as a countrySyria is a middle eastern nation with a small strip of Mediterranean coastline. Its overall area is a little smaller than the United Kingdom. Syria first became an independent nation in 1945 and has been formally known as the Arab Republic of Syria since 1991.Though it has pretences of being democratic, Syria has been led by the al-Assad family for 45 years. Hafez al-Assad ruled from 1970 to 2000. His first son died in a car crash and his second, Bashar al-Assad, has been president since 2000.2. How the civil war startedIn 2011, the people of several middle eastern and North African countries rose up against their leaders in a movement which became known as the Arab Spring. Many of the overthrown leaders were hard-line Islamists. Syria’s ruling family have never been that. The Assad family are Alawites — a branch of Islam which is relatively liberal.But despite living under a regime which allowed religious and other freedoms, many Syrians were still no fans of Bashar al-Assad. Angry about the failure of long-promised economic and political reforms, and emboldened by the Arab Spring uprisings, a series of anti-government protests began.For several reasons the protests soon turned ugly. A key flashpoint was the deaths (in detention) of some children who had painted anti-regime graffiti. There were also moments when the government brutally cracked down on protests, firing into the crowd.Soon, ordinary Syrians took up arms. Many of them were disenchanted former members of Assad’s military. Others were ordinary citizens. As things escalated into a full scale civil war, they were joined by a ragtag bunch of jihadists and others, who crossed borders to join the action on the side of the anti-government rebels.3. And the war raged on and on: it is impossibly messyIn the two years since we first tackled this issue, the Syrian Civil War has turned into a conflict so complicated, even the experts admit it almost defies description. It’s also a war no one is really winning or can win.“The war is at stalemate right now with the Syrian government in control of western and central Syria around Damascus, and with patchy control over parts of Aleppo in the north,” explains Dr Shanahan. “Islamic state is more eastern Syria-focused but it’s also in northern Syria.“There are also a variety of groups like Jabhat al-Nusra which is Al-Qaeda aligned. The bottom line is it’s bloody complex.”4. To make matters more complicated, everyone now has different aimsIn truth, this war was about Syrians versus the Assad regime for about five minutes. Then came the jihadists and then came IS, which as Dr Shanahan explains, wants to expand the caliphate it has loosely established in Iraq and parts of Syria across the whole of Syria.A caliphate, by the way, is a region governed by hard-line Islamic rule.But as Dr Shanahan explains, the problem here is competing goals. Every player in this war wants something different.“The non Islamist [rebel] groups don’t like Assad, IS want to expand the caliphate, groups like Jabhat al-Nusra want Islamic rule in Syria under their leadership, other Islamist groups want Islamic government although what that looks like and how it might be achieved is never articulated. But they all want Islamic rule in one way, shape, or form.”5. So basically you’ve got an unwinnable war.Dr Shanahan again: “I think what will end up happening is something short of the collapse of the Assad regime. A reasonable outcome you’d think is a ‘regime lite’ where Assad is not the ruler at an agreed time in the future, and where some opposition elements are incorporated in the government and military. How you get there is the difficulty.”6. Meanwhile the bodies stack upTwo years ago, the death toll including civilians and combatants was around 100 thousand. That figure is now generally estimated to be 240 thousand. That’s about 1400 Syrians killed as a direct or indirect result of this conflict each week over the last two years. To help you put those numbers in perspective, Syria’s overall population is almost identical to Australia’s 23 million.7. And the number of refugees is staggering. So why are they heading to Europe now?By most measures, it appears that as many as 11 million Syrians have been displaced. Of those, 4.1 million have fled the country and been registered as refugees with the UNHCR. The real number of refugees outside Syria is probably much higher.Why are they heading to Europe now?“My understanding is that the refugees are moving from Turkey [which shares a southern border with Syria] and my understanding is they are moving from there [towards Europe] because people smugglers have found a route less dangerous and cheaper,” Dr Shanahan says.“People can’t move in that kind of mass movement without people smugglers who have made the journey more accessible and cheaper. There has been no massive escalation in the war itself. People are just saying ‘we can make it to Europe now so let’s do it’. It’s a case of risk versus return. It’s also summer now in the northern hemisphere, which is a much better time to make a dangerous trip like this than winter.Unfortunately, as we all saw with the tragic case of drowned toddler Aylan Kurdi, the risk side of that equation remains devastatingly real.8. Meanwhile, what’s life like for those who remain in Syria?With four humanitarian missions under his belt, Father David Smith has some amazing insights into the lives of those who both literally and figuratively soldier on in Syria.He recalls one man he met who joined the rebels because they paid 50 dollars a month and all the cigarettes he could smoke. But he soon figured out that his commander was not even a Syrian (and was probably IS aligned). “I had gone from poverty and unemployment to slavery and beheadings,” the man told Father Dave.Another man told Father Dave, with his young pretty wife beside him and baby bouncing on his knee, how he’d done his bit for the army by killing up to 1500 people. He wasn’t boasting. He was merely acknowledging how the moral goalposts have shifted in the mess that is present day Syria.Yet the country itself is far from entirely dysfunctional. “Syria is going a lot better than Iraq thanks be to God,” Father Dave says. “There is a fully functioning bureaucracy. Unlike Lebanon, where garbage has not been collected for months, the garbage is collected in Syria.”As the country somehow stays functional in most areas, its people maintain their spirits.“Everywhere we went on our most recent trip in July, we saw thousands of kids, and all had fire in the eyes. They were full of life and spirit.“The streetlife was extraordinary, despite no lighting at night. People were dancing and drinking and saying ‘I don’t know how much longer I’m going to be alive, we might as well enjoy life’.“What I didn’t see was a sense of resignation,” Father Dave says. “There is a very strong sense of patriotic solidarity in Syria. People are gathering around the flag and around Assad, even if it’s not to do with him as a person or any decisions he has made.”It would be ironic if this war, which started as an anti-Assad crusade, ends up making people feel that Assad is the safe option. But there is evidence that the chaos caused by all the various factions in this war may produce exactly that result among the Syrians left behind.It’s doubly ironic given Dr Shanahan’s assertion that “the one thing unites all the opposition groups, whether Islamists or Free Syrian Army, is that Assad must leave”.Yet Dr Shanahan concedes that Assad may well represent “if nothing else, stability in a time of chaos”.9. What about Russia, the Saudis and other external players like the US and Australia?In short, there is strong evidence the Saudis are funding IS and others involved in Syria. Remember that Syria’s Assad regime are Shia Muslims while the Saudi regime and most Saudis are Sunni Muslims. So the Saudi desire to replace a Shia regime with Sunni Islam is just one of the complications which deeply underpins this conflict.Iran is also in the mix. What you need to know about Iran is that it is more than 90 per cent Shia. So it has a natural ally with Syria’s rulers and natural enemies elsewhere in the Middle East and Gulf region. So Iran has strong reasons to be supporting the ruling regime.Russia is an interesting player. It has a base in the Syrian port of Tartus, from where it is just over 1000 nautical miles to Russia’s Black Sea naval bases. Russia supports the Assad regime, which the west does not. Remember, Assad is said to have committed atrocities against his own citizens, including the use of chemical weapons (a claim which is disputed). So the west is not exactly Assad’s best friend.But nor is the west a friend of the rebels, given the rebels are such a loose, disparate collective which includes IS. In fact we want to bomb IS.10. So should we bomb IS? Will this in some way help stop the war?“The Americans’ grand scheme is to degrade IS to relieve pressure on Syrian army units and make room for other people that they’ve trained,” Dr Shanahan explains.With Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing a series of air strikes on IS in Syria, experts like Dr Shanahan remain unconvinced of what they’ll achieve.“Why should Australia bomb Syria? Australia has only got six aircraft. What operational effect will that have? There has just been no strategic intent. The government is wanting to show solidarity with the Americans, but it’s not going to have any kind of operational effect.”About the only thing we do know for sure is that Syria remains a mess. We’d like to offer you a more hopeful conclusion. But the main reason the world has been standing back and not doing much in Syria is because it’s unclear how to make a difference.That’s one reason why the world’s attention has swung to the refugee crisis.

WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why Syria has remained such a combustible mix. Photo: GettySYRIA was the last outpost of Communist Russia’s imperial dreams.President Vladimir Putin did not want to let it go.Now, according to an assessment published in the professional journal of the US Army, the  Military Review, he’s won.By direct implication, this implies a serious strategic setback for the United States.The Syrian Civil War has seen hundreds of thousands killed in more than 12 years of fighting.It was sparked by an uprising during what was then known as the “Arab Spring” — a democratic surge among the newly social-media linked citizens of the Middle East.But the Arab Winter has since well and truly set in.US trained and supplied Syrian rebels have failed to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Instead, they spent much of their force rolling back Islamic State.Assad himself has found renewed security in Moscow’s embrace.“The Syrian conflict will likely enter a new phase in 2018, as both Islamic State and the Syrian opposition cease to be relevant forces, and the two coalitions seek to negotiate a postconflict settlement,” the assessment reads.“While it is far from assured that any settlement acceptable to the principle domestic and international players can be struck, for now the main outcome of this war is that President Bashar al-Assad will stay, but the Syria that existed before the war is gone.”WAKING THE BEARPost Cold-War Russia has been concerned by the United States’ ongoing interventions worldwide.It didn’t like the idea of military intervention in Libya to oust Ghadaffis’ regime. And the prospect of assertive “regime change” in its former client state of Syria was even more unpalatable.This appeared to be the case in 2011, when then President of the United States Barack Obama declared President Assad a dictator and demanded he step aside.Russia immediately set about blocking any intervention in Syria through the United Nations, and began quietly restocking Assad’s arsenal.But soon Assad found himself in trouble.His forces had retreated to a few coastal and border cities. Rebels held much of Syria’s heartland. And the black flag of Islamic State was rolling in from the Iraq desert.So, in 2015, Moscow directly intervened.It sent in its combat jets.“Russia has only been directly involved in this conflict since September 2015, but its intervention has radically changed the war’s outcome,” the US Army publication states. “The natural question is whether Russia has, in fact, won a victory.”PUTIN’S GAMBITMoscow, the assessment argues, didn’t want to look weak.It was struggling to adapt to international pressure and sanctions imposed after its 2014 annexation of Crimea and the shadow-invasion of eastern Ukraine.“Rather than giving in to Western pressure and offering concessions on Ukraine, Moscow looked to Syria to broaden the confrontation on terms more favourable to itself,” the article says. “Eventually, Russia hoped its Syrian intervention could force Washington and its European allies to abandon Ukraine-related sanctions and diplomatic isolation in the interests of achieving a negotiated settlement with Russia over Syria.”Since 2015, Russian forces have shored up Assad’s front lines.There have been few retreats. Now, his troops are advancing once again.And Russian bombers are frequently seen in the skies of the last rebel strongholds, such as the city of Ghouta.RELATED: Russia’s Su-57 stealth fighter faces-off against US F-22“A successful intervention could offer victory on three fronts: preventing US-backed regime change in Syria, breaking out of political isolation and forcing Washington to deal with Russia as an equal, and demonstrating at home that Russia is a great power on the main stage of international politics,” the US army assessment states. “Moscow hoped Syria would offer a new and more favourable front, where the United States could be outmanoeuvred in the broader confrontation.”Now, in 2018, Assad’s position is once again secure.Islamic State is all but defeated.US-supported rebel forces are being rolled back.The Kurd separatist ethnic group in the north is buckling under a Turkish invasion.And US/Coalition combat jets and ground-forces can do little but look on.In this broad context, it does look as though Moscow can claim some sort of victory.MOSCOW’S METHODS“Russia has become a potential powerbroker, and perhaps a balancer against US influence, even if it did not embark on the Syrian campaign with those goals in mind,” the Army press article states.Achieving such a goal was not easy.Moscow had to destroy the Syrian Rebels’ capacity to fight. It had to fend off concerns from Turkey, the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel.“The risks of escalation to direct conflict between the intervening powers were considerable, as underscored by Syria’s use of chemical weapons in March 2017, resulting in a prompt retaliatory US cruise missile strike, or the Turkish shoot down of a Russian Su-24M2 in November 2016,” the article highlights.RELATED: US troops clash with Russian mercenaries in SyriaMoscow-controlled media was prolific in showing images of its Su-30 strike fighters and Su-24 bombers on the runway of the Hmeimim Air Base. Much ado was made about a foray by Russia’s only aircraft carrier, Kuznetzov, with its battlefleet into the Eastern Mediterranean.And cruise-missile strikes from Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bombers, along with those fired from submarines and warships, repeatedly made the headlines.Meanwhile, 2000 of its mercenaries and 3000 soldiers were on the ground in Syria, ensuring pressure was being applied where it was needed most.All the while, the battle against US-backed “moderate” Syrian rebels was being painted by Moscow as just another act in the war against “terrorism”.TRUMP’S CAPITULATION“Over time, Moscow achieved success on both the military and political fronts, coercing adversaries and negotiating changes to their positions one by one, though the pathway to this outcome was hardly a smooth or straightforward one,” the authors note. “Russia’s success is not unqualified, but at the time of this writing, it appears that if the campaign in Syria is not a victory for Russia, it is certainly a defeat for those who opposed the Russian-led coalition.”But all is not clear-cut for Moscow.The US army highlights it is not truly in control of its Syria-Iran coalition.Which makes it vulnerable to fallout from their independent actions.“(The) latest declaration of victory, ahead of the March 2018 presidential election, is fraught with risk since Russian forces are not just staying but further expanding the infrastructure at Tartus and Hmeimim,” the assessment reads.International sanctions are still in place. And Russia is becoming increasingly associated with Assad’s chemical weapons attacks.But it also notes Moscow has won international acceptance of its role as a key player in Syria’s future.And with US President Donald Trump now telegraphing a rapid and complete withdrawal of US assets in Syria “very soon”, this would leave President Vladimir Putin as the last man standing on top of the pile of rubble that remains behind.“In sum, Russia appears to have won at least a partial victory in Syria, and done so with impressive efficiency, flexibility, and co-ordination between military and political action,” the assessment concludes. “On the one hand, Russia’s embrace of the Assad regime and its Iranian allies, its relative indifference to civilian casualties, and its blanket hostility to antiregime opposition groups are fundamentally at odds with widely held US views on Syria. On the other hand, Russia’s “lean” strategy, adaptable tactics, and co-ordination of military and diplomatic initiatives offer important lessons for the conduct of any military intervention in as complex and volatile an environment as the Middle East.”News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

The Syrian government has claimed victory in Aleppo but its problems are far from over.As reports mounted of regime ceasefire violations in besieged Aleppo on December 14, Jaish al-Fateh rebels inside the city mounted multiple attacks against pro-Assad forces in the southern Jisr al-Hajj area with both Grad rockets and a car bombing. The car bombing was carried out by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighter Abu Islam, according to video released by the group, previously affiliated with al-Qaeda under the Jabhat al-Nusra flag. Activist reports suggest that a number of pro-Assad forces, mostly Lebanese and Iraqi militiamen, were killed in the car bombing attack. Such incidents occurred during the daytime hours of December 14. Activists inside the city have said that clashes came to a halt during the late evening hours of December 14, just hours ahead of planned evacuations for wounded civilians out of the city. Credit: YouTube/Jaish al-Fateh via StoryfulIT HAS been a long and bloody conflict leaving hundreds of thousands dead. But despite the Syrian government claiming a victory in Aleppo, its problems are far from over.Thousands of civilians remain trapped and face a desperate fight for survival just days after President Bashar al-Assad announced the Syrian army regained control of the city from rebel forces.The once thriving commercial centre has been reduced to a war zone, and many of its once famous buildings and monuments left in ruins after five long and brutal years of civil war.So how did it get this way?WHAT’S GOING ON?The Syrian army on Monday announced it was in control of 98 per cent of Aleppo following a military offensive which began on November 26.Along with Aleppo, the Syrian government also controls the capital, Damascus, parts of southern Syria, Deir Az Zor, most of the territory along the border with Lebanon as well as most of the northwestern coast. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State and Kurdish forces.IS THERE STILL FIGHTING?Yes, despite Assad claiming a victory in Aleppo, the city remains in the grip of conflict and confusion.Just today, a ceasefire to evacuate rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held neighbourhoods of Aleppo unravelled, once again raising the spectre of a bloody end to the battle for Syria’s largest city.Residents reported shelling and brutal bombing runs had resumed while Assad opponents accused the government and its allies of scuttling the deal by adding new conditions, including the lifting of a rebel siege on two pro-government Shiite villages in nearby Idlib province. However, hours after it crumbled, the rebels insist the deal was back on.HOW DID THE CIVIL WAR START?In 2011, Syria was caught up in the Arab Spring uprising which saw Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak toppled from power.That March, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad’s forces.By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war.WHAT WERE THEY ANGRY ABOUT?The Assad family has held power in the country since 1971.The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate.WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?Rebels seized eastern Aleppo in July 2012, dividing the city, resulting in intense fighting and bombs being dropped on the densely populated rebel-held east, causing an estimated one million civilians to flee. Another half million were displaced.Things got messier in August after insurgents gained control of the Aleppo-Damascus highway, tightening the siege on the government part of the city.WHAT DOES ISLAMIC STATE HAVE TO DO WITH IT?Quite a lot, not only does the Syrian government have rebels to contend with but also Islamic State forces as well.By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in the eastern part of the city.By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back.Around 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front.WHO’S INVOLVED?Aside from Syrian forces, Russia, Iran and even Lebanon have bolstered Assad in the civil war.In October 2015, Russia began air strikes while Syrian troops launched an offensive around Aleppo. Iraqi, Lebanese and Iranian militias also threw their weight behind the government.Meanwhile several Arab states, along with Turkey, provided support to rebel groups in Syria, Al Jazeera reported.The US has accused President Assad of being responsible for widespread atrocities and want to see him out of power. So far though it has tried to avoid taking part in any attacks which might directly benefit the Syrian army.It supports Syria’s main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, and also provides limited military assistance to moderate rebels, the BBC reported.The Free Syrian Army (FSA) receives support from the US Central Intelligence Agency, while the Kurdish Popular Defence Units (YPG and YPJ) receive support from the US Department of Defence, according to Quartz.In September 2014, the US joined the international coalition against Islamic State but has avoided intervening in battles between rebel and Assad forces.DEADLY COST TO HUMANITYPeople on both sides have been killed, and the death toll from the civil war is now estimated to stand at 312,000 according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The toll includes more than 53,000 rebels and nearly 110,000 pro-regime fighters, among them more than 60,000 Syrian soldiers. But it also includes tens of thousands of Syrian militiamen, members of Lebanon’s Shiite Hezbollah movement and other foreign fighters.However according to Al Jazeera the death toll from the conflict is closer to 450,000 with 12 million Syrians displaced.UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called on the Syrian government, Russia and Iran to urgently allow civilians to escape Aleppo.“We have collectively failed the people of Syria,” he said at a UN Security Council meeting. “History will not easily absolve us.”Both the west and the UN claim civilians have been intentionally killed, but the Syrian army has denied carrying out killings or torture among those captured.It is also feared civilians are too scared to flee and thousands remain hidden, trusting neither side to keep them safe.WASN’T THERE ALREADY A CEASE FIRE?Yes, in February this year Russia and the US brokered a ceasefire with rebels that excluded extremists, however it was short-lived and it collapsed just two months later.In July the government and allied forces imposed a full siege on eastern Aleppo, home to an estimated 250,000 people. Rebel fighters broke the siege for a couple of weeks but it was reimposed by August. The following month another ceasefire negotiated by Russia and the US held for a few days, but talks to bring in aid got nowhere.Soon after Russia announced it was suspending air strikes in eastern Aleppo so aid and medical evacuations could get in and out. But rebels rejected the offer and the UN announced it couldn’t carry out medical evacuations due to security concerns.WHAT NOW?Last month, the Syrian army launched a renewed and intensified aerial campaign. Syrian troops and allied forces launched a major ground offensive, causing rebel defences to crumble and thousands to flee.A ceasefire, brokered by Turkey and Russia, was announced overnight to allow the evacuation of rebels and civilians and effectively surrendering the city to the government.But it never truly took hold on the ground and government shelling continues.— with AP and AFPdebra.killalea@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77c9ab4719c85521657315"},"header":"Shocking numbers that sum up Syrian Civil War","time":"February 8, 20168:50am","content":"IT WAS a vibrant country with an important cultural influence. Now shocking statistics reveal the extent of the damage done to Syria’s lost generation. IT REPRESENTS the greatest humanitarian challenge of our time. Five years of intense fighting has plunged a once vibrant country into darkness. The destruction and despair wrought by the Syrian Civil War has caused a “systematic” obliteration of infrastructure and population. Such is the backward direction of the country, that from 2010 to 2015, the average life expectancy fell by a staggering 20 years.Just five years ago the life expectancy of a child born in Syria was 75.9 years, but that number has since fallen to an estimated 55.7 years. In contrast, the average life expectancy in Australia is 82.2 years.A complete death toll in the war is impossible to pin down, but estimates from aid organisations and the United Nations put the number at more than 270,000 people — thousands more than the number killed in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.According to aid organisation Mercy Corps, “half the country’s pre-war population — more than 11 million people — have been killed or forced to flee their homes”.The UN estimates close to four million Syrians have fled the country — a trend that has fuelled an incredibly difficult European refugee crisis that has dominated global headlines.A further seven million Syrians are believed to be internally displaced due to the fighting, and those left behind face almost impossible circumstances.A shocking 80 per cent of Syrians are now deemed to be living in poverty. More than three million have lost their jobs since fighting broke out in 2010, according to a 2015 UN-backed report.Unemployment has surged from 14.9 per cent in 2011 to 57.7 per cent at the end of 2014.“Thirty per cent of the population have descended into abject poverty where households struggle to meet the basic food needs to sustain bare life,” the report said.Of the millions displaced and suffering, Syria’s children are bearing the brunt of the crisis and have been dubbed the country’s “lost generation”.An estimated four million Syrian children are out of school or any formal education at the moment, adding to the disastrous long term effects of the conflict.“The scale of the crisis for children is growing all the time, which is why there are now such fears that Syria is losing a whole generation of its youth,” said Peter Salama, regional director of the UN’s Children’s Fund.A majority of the country live half their lives under a blanket of darkness as the damage accumulated in the war has caused 83 per cent of the country’s electricity to be cut.An image taken from space at night shows how the lights have slowly faded from the night sky over Syria.The images above were taken by a team of researchers from Wuhan University in China from satellites 800km above the earth.“These satellite images help us understand the suffering and fear experienced by ordinary Syrians as their country is destroyed around them,” said Dr Xi Li, the lead researcher on the project, in a statement.While the emotional toll of the ongoing civil war is impossible to define, the financial cost is so far projected to have surpassed $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue.“With the economic and structural losses and the destruction of oil resources, agriculture, industry, trade, infrastructure and the displacement of millions of people, the total losses suffered by Syria easily exceeds 200 billion dollars,” the head of the Syrian Economic Task Force, Osama Kadi, said last year.Homs, the third largest city in Syria, has been reduced to rubble and today shows a faint flicker of the life it once held. Drone footage circulated online last week shows the devastation suffered by the city and led prominent Middle East commentator, Maajid Nawaz, to comment: “Are we fighting to control cities of rubble?”THE LATESTPeace talks stalled last week as the Syrian army secured a major battlefield victory against insurgent rebels, and Russia vowed to continue its aerial bombardment in support of the Assad regime.The continued fighting marred the fragile peace talks, which rebel groups said they would refuse to join until Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stopped attacking Syrian rebels.Peace talks are set to resume on February 25.The aid group Mercy Corps says intensified air strikes and fighting around Aleppo have cut off the main humanitarian route into the Syrian city, and that tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing north toward the border with Turkey.David Evans, Mercy Corps’ regional program director for the Middle East, said in a statement on Thursday that the group’s operations in northern Syria “have been effectively sliced in half.”Tens of thousands of Syrians who fled the Russia-backed government offensive in Aleppo are now stranded at the border with Turkey.Turkey has vowed to help the crowds of people, including many women and children, but has not opened its borders and aid agencies have warned they are facing a “desperate” situation as they wait for help.“Turkey has reached the limit of its capacity to absorb the refugees,” Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told CNN Turk television.“But in the end, these people have nowhere else to go. Either they will die beneath the bombings ... or we will open our borders.“We are not in a position to tell them not to come. If we do, we would be abandoning them to their deaths.”Turkey’s Oncupinar border crossing, which faces the Bab al-Salama frontier post inside Syria, remained closed on Sunday as thousands of refugees gathered there for a third day waiting for the gate to open.One small piece of good news came last week as world leaders pledged more than $US10 billion to help fund schools, shelter and jobs for the refugees of Syria’s civil war.The money was pledged following an aid conference in London last Thursday (Friday AEDT) and, according to British Prime Minister David Cameron, “will save lives, will give hope, will give people the chance of a future”.“Never has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis,” United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.“The promises of long-term funding and loans mean that humanitarian and development partners will be able to work together to get children back into school, design employment programs and begin rebuilding infrastructure.”THE NUMBERS● More than 270,000 killed● Life expectancy reduced by 20 years● Four million Syrians are external refugees● Nearly seven million are displaced inside the country● Four out of five Syrians live in poverty● Unemployment has risen to nearly 60 per cent● Four million children are missing out on formal schooling● More than 80 per cent of country’s electricity has been cut● More than $US200 billion in damage and lost revenue● Thirteen million in need of assistance● Largest current refugee crisis in the worldNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Here’s why we’re all turning a blind eye. The affluent and third world countries seem to barely acknowledge conflict in Syria due to how it is as seen as hopeless. The Australian's Paul Kelly addresses the tragedy. Courtesy: Q\u0026AIT’S been dubbed the “biggest story on the planet”.So why does the West largely turn a blind eye to the deadliest conflict of the 21st century?That was one of the questions put to the panel on the ABC’s Q\u0026A program on Monday night.Host Tony Jones said the war in Syria was “probably the biggest story on the planet but we rarely get to talk about it (because it) seems like a long way to affluent people”.According to Save the Children International chief executive and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt, Syria was “quite a normal country” about eight years ago.“I was there and met President Assad,” Ms Thorning Schmidt said.“It was beginning to become a normal country. Now we have six million people who have fled and so many children who are traumatised perhaps for life about what has happened there.”More than 300,000 Syrians have been killed in the ongoing armed conflict which started with anti-government protests before escalating into a full-scale civil war on July 19, 2012.The War in Syria has caused millions of Syrians — about half the country’s pre-war population — to be displaced as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other and jihadist militants including those from Islamic State.The widespread destruction of infrastructure has seen Aleppo, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, all but obliterated by barrel bombs, bullets, chemical attacks and air strikes in the war.Ms Thorning Schmidt said the organisation was calling on all countries to engage in a Security Council agreement.“(It includes) rules of war that the warring partner will live by where you don’t bomb schools, you don’t bomb hospitals, you get access for humanitarian workers to get in and pick children and people up to get them to safe spaces and hospitals,” she said.“There’s still a lot we could be doing and it’s been very, very difficult to work in Aleppo and other places.”“It is important that we just sit back and urge everyone who is a warring party in that conflict, and there’s a few, to just live by some very simple rules where you should not be bombing a hospital.“You should not be bombing humanitarian aid workers that are trying to get access into the cities, you should not be bombing schools.”‘THE DEGREE OF DAMAGE TO HUMAN LIFE IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE’The Australian editor-at-large Paul Kelly said there was a “sense of hopelessness” about the war in Syria.“The outlook, as far as I can see, is pretty bleak at the moment,” Mr Kelly said.“There have been efforts at negotiations. They haven’t been successful.“The degree of destruction and damage to human life is incomprehensible.”Mr Kelly said the war “defied our sense of humanity (and) political imagination”.“The idea 10 years ago this would have happened to Syria would have been beyond any sort of human understanding,” he said.“And the parties, the parties are locked in this conflict and they seem to be willing at this stage to continue the conflict for their own particular objectives.”SHOULD AUSTRALIA INCREASE FOREIGN AID TO SYRIA?The panel also discussed whether or not countries including Australia were taking serious steps to end the conflict and increase foreign aid.The talk soon moved to who funded terrorists in Syria and whether or not Australia should cut supplies to the country.Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the major players were not just the Assad regime and Islamic State.“The Russians are heavily involved and with a veto at the UN Security Council, that has put a block on united action through the UN,” Mr Frydenberg said.“Iran is a Shiite country.“And Assad is part of a minority group — only 13 per cent of Syria — but a Shiite sect. So Iran is heavily involved providing support through Hezbollah to the Syrian regime.”The panel heard Saudis and other Gulf Arab states have also been involved in “funding the other side”.“It plays to a much bigger schism in the Islamic world between the Sunni and the Shiite sects,” Mr Frydenberg said.“And the US, famously Obama said, there is a red line here.“If they use chemical weapons, we’ll take action.“There’s lots of evidence to suggest that red line was crossed but no subsequent action was taken.”The final word went to Ms Thorning Schmidt who said it was important not to let other countries with people suffering be forgotten.“Let’s not forget we have about 14 million right now who are in a serious situation, many in risk of famine in the horn of Africa,” she said.“There’s a toxic mix between war and drought, climate change, poverty, everything’s happened there. And they are at real risk of famine.“The reason I’m here is one day I got very, very angry by how this world treats its children.”News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

But what happened when cameras left the town of walking “skeletons”?In the Syrian town of Madaya, children and villagers were denied food for so long they resembled skeletons.IT’S the town that made global headlines after it was revealed that, after eating all the dogs and cats, residents were so hungry they had turned to boiling grass to stay alive.Madaya, in Syria, became known as a place of living “skeletons”, where pregnant women were too weak to give birth and children were starved to death as a deliberate tactic of war by Syrian despot Bashar al-Assad.Now, one of only two “doctors” who stayed behind has spoken about the true horror that befell Madaya once the world’s media lost interest.As thousands of people finally begin to evacuate it and other besieged towns in Syria, Dr Mohammad Darwish says the world knew about what was happening in Madaya two years ago, and did nothing to stop it.In an interview with the ABC’s Sophie McNeil, Dr Darwish — a dental student before the outbreak of civil war — said people inside Madaya were trapped in a living nightmare.“No matter what words I use, I still can’t tell you enough about what we endured in this town,” Dr Darwish said.“During the days of the starvation, almost no people were walking on the streets, people had no energy to walk or to stand up.”‘BAGS OF MILK FOR $100’Residents at the time reported being without food for so long, they had “forgotten what bread tastes like”, and the ability to smuggle in supplies became so rare and risky that a bag of milk was fetching $100, or a kilo of rice $150. Malnourished mothers lost the ability to breastfeed and people had taken to boiling weeds and grass for “soup.”“Young people, women and children have turned into skeletons from hunger. The town needs everything,” said Moaz al-Qalamuni, a journalist in Madaya said in January last year as a brutal winter and no energy for heating threatened to freeze many to death.While the Syrian Government did allow some supplies into the rebel-held town, dozens of people died of starvation as they waited for aid.Dr Darwish said more than 80 people perished from lack of food and diseases that could have been cured with proper medical treatment, while others were killed by landmines that had been ringed around the town so that no one could leave.He said the West, along with the UN Security Council and the other UN bodies, hadn’t done enough to help despite knowing how dire the situation had become.“It’s shameful, they let us down,” he said. “Specifically us the people of Madaya and the Syrian people in general.“The world watched us die and be massacred and they did nothing.”In a Q\u0026A on Syria:direct in August last year, the 26-year-old revealed that he, another dentist and a vet were left to treat more than 40,000 of Madaya’s citizens, despite being woefully underequipped.In some circumstances, the trio couldn’t offer any treatment at all.“If a situation requires major surgery, there’s nothing that we can do,” he said.“One time, there were three children who were injured by a landmine. They were rushed to the hospital, but we just stood there staring. The children died before our very eyes that day.”Dr Darwish said it was heartbreaking to watch children and babies die simply because there wasn’t the equipment, training or knowledge to save them.Sometimes the best they could do was talk to doctors overseas via messaging app whatsapp for advice on what to do.WOMEN TOO WEAK TO GIVE BIRTHThe rebel-held town of Madaya has been cut off from the world for almost two years.Surrounded by Syrian Government forces and their allies, those in the town have little chance of getting out, and even less hope of getting food and supplies in.Last year the UN revealed there were credible reports of people dying of starvation in Madaya.Children soon became malnourished and lived mainly off rice, with other food difficult to attain, the BBC reported.Mothers were miscarrying and some were so weak they were unable to give birth.Landmines laid around the town meant escape was almost impossible especially for those who were chronically ill, the young and elderly.Last week residents in Madaya and surrounds were offered a glimmer of hope as hundreds of terrorised Syrians were evacuated from besieged towns under a a deal brokered by regime ally Iran and Qatar, a longtime supporter of Syrian rebel groups.However, many became stuck on Thursday at a rebel-held transit point where dozens of their fellow townspeople were killed in a weekend bombing.About 3000 evacuees left their homes in the government-controlled towns of Fuaa and Kafraya at dawn on Wednesday as part of a deal under which residents and fighters are also to be evacuated from several rebel areas surrounded by government forces.Shiite-dominated Iran has repeatedly raised concerns for the mainly Shiite residents of Fuaa and Kafraya, who are besieged by Sunni rebels and Islamists who control the surrounding Idlib province.Those leaving rebel-held areas will head to Idlib province, which is held by an opposition alliance.Under the agreement, residents and rebel fighters are being evacuated from the towns of Madaya, Zabadani, and other nearby opposition-held areas close to Damascus.A second set of evacuations which will see up to 30,000 people transferred from their homes, will take place in June.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime has presented evacuation deals as the best way to end Syria’s war, which has killed more than 320,000 people and forced more than half the population from their homes.The opposition says the evacuations amount to forced relocation after years of bombardment and siege.Syria’s opposition and Western leaders have accused Assad’s regime of a wide range of abuses during the conflict, including a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun earlier this month that killed at least 87 people.debra.killalea@news.com.auAt least 43 people were killed and many others injured on April 15 when a blast struck a convoy of buses carrying evacuees from besieged pro-regime towns in Idlib province to an opposition-held area in west Aleppo. The blast happened at a location where an exchange between pro-regime and rebel forces was due to take place. Evacuations resumed later on April 15, under an agreement known as the Four Towns Deal. The agreement allowed rebel fighters and their families to leave the besieged rebel-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani in Damascus province and pro-regime fighters and their families to leave the besieged pro-regime towns of Kefraya and al-Foua in Idlib province, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77c9e94719c8552165731b"},"header":" A New Zealander's story: My escape from Syria's civil war  ","time":"Saturday, 18 August 2018","content":" A few weeks ago I packed a few suitcases of clothes, gathered my 5-year-old daughter, Zenobia, and headed for Damascus airport to get out of Syria as it descended ever more deeply into the horrors of civil war. The mood in the car was sombre. Zenobia's enthusiasm for air travel was buried under her apprehension about leaving behind her mother, my diplomat wife Hanlie, who would pack up the house and tie up loose ends. She understood these were not usual times. The route to the airport was, thankfully, clear of trouble and the armed soldiers and security intelligence officers at the five checkpoints we passed were polite and relaxed. But a couple of kilometres to the north, towards the Old City, columns of smoke could be seen rising as Government forces bombarded the Tadamon and Jobar districts, trying to flush out rebels. Since Syria's version of the Arab uprising against decaying authoritarian regimes broke out in March last year, security across the country had been steadily eroding. In December, big car bombs hit two security compounds in Kafer Suseh, central Damascus, close to where I was helping with some writing and editing for Syria Today magazine. Forty-four people were killed and 166 injured. Spasmodic violence continued in the following months, making life steadily more dangerous. Then, in July, armed rebels took over some districts in the city. Fighting and shelling became a daily event and the peril ever-present. It was no longer worth the risk to remain in the city. In our three-and-a-half years in Syria, we saw the country not only from street level but also from the edges of elite circles - our daughter was at school with the son of President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma and they attended school functions like any well-to-do couple. And for two years I was able to travel extensively, from the black-stoned Roman remains in Bosra in the south, to the crumbling 5000-year-old Mesopotamian ruins at Mari on the Euphrates. I visited the Roman ruin at Palmyra, the 3700-year-old site of Ugarit and the luminescent St Simeon Cathedral ruin north of Aleppo near the Turkish border. On the other hand we knew what it was like to be shadowed by the security forces and to be surrounded by angry mobs. Many of our Syrian friends told stories of rampant bribery, cronyism, arbitrary arrest and lengthy imprisonment without trial. Yet when the Arab Spring broke out last year, Syria seemed the least likely place that would succumb. Though it was still a totalitarian state, some reform had been allowed and Bashar and Asma seemed to be popular, at least among the middle classes. All that began to change in March last year when security forces overstepped the mark by torturing a group of children caught writing anti-government graffiti. The cracks swiftly appeared in the brittle structure of the state, exposing deep divisions in the country along regional, religious, ethnic and class lines. These divisions had been hidden by a ruthless Soviet-style police state, in which all organs of government were controlled by the presidency and the security apparatus. The citizen effectively had no rights and the government no requirement for accountability. About 15 branches of the 70,000 strong security apparatus, supported by networks of informers, ensured that all political space was shut down and the media tightly controlled. Any active opposition figures were imprisoned or exiled. The secret police, the Mukhabarat, were everywhere. Young men in black leather jackets and jeans with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders frequently reminded me that I could not take photos near the multitude of security and military compounds around Damascus. Whenever I travelled out of the city, they followed in the security services' standard issue beat-up Peugeot 404s. There was no hiding the poverty in the poorer towns and the slums encircling Damascus and Aleppo. In 2010, per capita GDP was only US$5200 ($6228) and 34 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line. Unemployment was estimated at over 20 per cent, and was especially high for the young. Cronyism, corruption and nepotism were rampant throughout government. A friend of mine returned to Syria in 2009, after living outside of the country for several years. To clear her possessions from customs at the port in Lattakia, she was required to pay a bribe of US$1000. The regime controlled all government employment. Merit was not part of the process. It was \"wasta\", or patronage, that counted. Citizens were frequently arrested and detained without charge. A friend spent many years in Assad jails without charge for suspected association with the banned Muslim Brotherhood, membership of which carries the death penalty. The Assad family occupied the very top of the Syrian power pyramid, and controlled the security apparatus including the police, the military, and the Mukhabarat. Below them were layers of mostly fellow Alawite senior functionaries, supported by Christians and Sunnis who knew their only way to get ahead was to ally with the regime. The Government was essentially a huge family mafia. The Alawites, a Shia sect, make up 10 per cent of Syria's population, Christians 10 per cent, Sunnis 70 per cent, Druze two per cent, Kurds 7 per cent and others 1 per cent. On the surface the sectarian make-up of the country had little impact on daily life. Government censors would not allow reference to any sectarian group. Syria was a secular Arab nationalist state with social and religious freedom: there were no restrictions on dress and alcohol was discreetly available. But the regime ruled by fear. Its propaganda machine instilled in the population a fear of Muslim extremism, of Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, Wahabis and Al Qaeda. The aim was to ensure the support of Alawites, Christians, and Druze, and the more liberal Sunnis. In the first couple of years we were there, Syria seemed to be emerging from a long period of isolation. Relations with Turkey had improved dramatically, with free trade and visa-free agreements. The economy was also growing, if slowly at 3.4 per cent, with tourism making up for declining oil and gas revenues. Since 2005, Assad had moved, if haltingly, to reform the economy on a market-social model. Foreign investment, particularly in the banking sector, was encouraged. Despite the obvious poverty, in Damascus and Aleppo wealth was evident on the streets with luxury cars and European boutiques evidence of a growing elite. Against this background, when colleagues asked me in February 2011 - after the Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya uprisings - whether Syria might be next, I said \"very unlikely\". At that time Assad was 45 years old and his wife Asma 35. They were a popular couple. Some economic reforms had brought change, and although Assad's talk of political reform had produced no results, there was the hope that the regime would read the signs in the region and get ahead of the reform game. Importantly, unlike Tunisia and the other dictatorships in the region, the Syrian leadership was not allied to the West. Syria stood, with Iran and the Lebanese Shia militia cum political party Hizbullah, against the so-called \"Zionist-American project\" in the Middle East, a policy popular on the Arab street. Well, I was wrong. My perspective was perhaps coloured by personal experience. Zenobia spent a year in the same class as Karim al-Assad, the president's son. When I attended parent-teacher meetings, Asma, the \"first lady\", was present. Her contributions were always low-key, but it was clear she was a liberal, modern, intelligent and eloquent woman. At the end-of-year school concert Bashar and Asma came along in their jeans and leather jackets, and mingled freely with the children. This outgoing and relaxed style had endeared this couple to the country's moneyed elite and the rising middle class, if not the country at large. The regime's true colours were shown when 15 children wrote anti-government graffiti on a wall in the southern city of Dera'a in March last year. The security forces arrested them, took them to Damascus, beat and tortured them, including pulling out some fingernails. This outraged their extended families and fellow citizens who took to the streets in protest where security forces fired on the unarmed crowd, killing several people. The regime's strategy was immediately revealed - it would intimidate and bludgeon all opposition into submission using deadly force if necessary. But demonstrations spread across the country. Syria's time had come. The protests, and the regime's response, shocked everyone. After 40 years of fear, suppression, censorship and intimidation, a self-liberation took hold as citizens massed in the streets, initially shouting for democratic reforms, dignity, an end to corruption and a reigning-in of the security services. As protest spread and the crackdown intensified, the demands escalated into calls for an end to the Assad regime. The fear barrier had been broken. In April last year we saw for ourselves how the divisions in Syrian society were opening up when we travelled to Aleppo, stopping on the way to view the \"lost cities\", a cluster of AD400 Byzantine towns. At the town of Murat Al-Numan we noticed a large group of young men standing around with Syrian flag; a kilometre away was another group of 200 or 300 marching toward the town. A young Syrian pulled up and shouted in English that we must turn around, \"there was trouble\". We did so. But by then the group in town had swelled. Armed with sticks and clubs they were marching towards the other group, shouting pro-government slogans. We were caught in the middle. To our relief the angry mob let us pass through their ranks without incident. The two groups embodied the sharp divisions that were opening up in Syrian society.. The regime's propaganda response was that the violence emanated from \"armed terrorist groups\", including criminals and religious extremists, supported by foreigners. The regime staged televised \"confessions\" of young men with their weapons to validate the story, while armed thugs were recruited by the regime into the mostly Alawite \"Shabbiha\" gangs to do the more unsavoury intimidation work. The torture of protesters, mostly young, became routine. A friend of mine had one of his workers arrested. They beat and humiliated him for 10 days, then left him alone for 20 days for his wounds to heal, then released him to his family. Such stories are very common. In some cases the regime would return a mutilated corpse. Assad belatedly announced some modest political reforms as protests increased. The emergency law, invoked following the 1963 Baathist coup, was lifted. A new media law was passed. A referendum on a new constitution was held on February 26, 2012. Parliamentary elections were held on May 7, and a new government formed on June 23. However these \"reforms\" were a sham and included no input from the opposition, who boycotted the elections. The secular veneer of Syrian society began to lift as the violence intensified. The protesters and victims of state violence were overwhelmingly Sunni. They were being killed and tortured by a security apparatus which was predominantly Shia Alawite. The UN Human Rights Council appointed an independent commission on Syria which released a report last month confirming that government forces had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, torture, sexual violence, looting and destruction of property. The report also found that government forces and \"Shabbiha\" had massacred 108 civilians in Houla, a massacre the regime had blamed on \"armed terrorist groups\". The commission found opposition fighters had also committed war crimes, including murder, extrajudicial execution and torture. During the first six months of the uprising, the regime was able to mount some huge pro-government demonstrations, particularly in Damascus. These were held on weekdays so government workers and schoolchildren could be marshalled to attend. But communities of Alawis and Christians and others also willingly attended. These rallies stopped as the regime became increasingly aware its support base was shrinking. It is very difficult to assess support for the regime, but there is little doubt that it is still considerable. A Christian friend of mine remains implacably in support of Assad, but only because he fears the rule of the majority Sunnis, a rule he believes would be extremist and anti-Christian. The sharp domestic divide is mirrored at regional and international levels. Iran has been closely allied to Syria since the Assads backed them in their 1980-1988 war against Iraq. Iran is supplying both weapons and technical assistance to the Assad regime. Syria has also facilitated the supply of Iranian arms to Hizbullah, which is now the leading faction in the Lebanese government. The US-British invasion of Iraq facilitated the rise of the majority Shia to power there, and as a result Iraq too supports the Assad regime. On the other side of the regional divide Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have all called for an orderly transition and for Assad to step down. It is widely believed that Saudi Arabia and Qatar are supplying arms to anti-government rebels. The Arab League sent monitors to Syria in December last year to help negotiate a ceasefire, but they were withdrawn three months later, having been ignored by both sides. The international community is also divided. Russia and China have blocked three UN Security Council resolutions to put pressure on Assad to implement a ceasefire and engage the opposition in dialogue. Though the Security Council did agree to a joint Arab League-UN peace initiative under former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, the mission was without teeth and it failed. Annan left his post last month and the 300 strong UN Supervisory Mission in Syria, which included a small New Zealand element, was withdrawn. Lakhdar Ebrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, replaced Annan three weeks ago. He admitted that his mission is \"almost impossible\", and most analysts doubt he can conjure up the peaceful solution which eluded Annan. Too much blood has been spilled. Coinciding with Ebrahimi's appointment, Mohammad Mursi, Egypt's president, convened a regional \"Quartet\" comprising Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Quartet seems as divided as the Security Council and without a change in Iran's stance is unlikely to be in a position to pressure the Assad regime or the rebels to lay down arms and begin a dialogue. After 18 months, the Syrian uprising has claimed more than 20,000 lives according to a conservative UN estimate. More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced, 2.5 million require humanitarian assistance, and more than 230,000 have fled and are registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Syrian opposition groups say 26,000 people have been detained. From the outset, Assad's regime has unswervingly followed the security solution, and government forces have resorted to artillery, tank, and more recently air bombardments including on residential areas. The regime is morphing into an Alawite militia prepared to fight it out to the bitter end, regardless of the cost to the country. Negotiation and compromise are not part of the state's lexicon. And the ranks of anti-government rebels have been growing steadily as more and more Syrians take up arms to avenge the violence against their families, villages and towns. The boldness of their attacks on government targets has increased, and regime \"insiders\" are helping them. Our lives over the past few months had become increasingly constrained by security considerations. There were several small roadside bombs targeting military vehicles exploding just a few kilometres from the house. All unnecessary travel was curtailed. However the wider dangers of this war came home to us personally in July this year when the opposition Free Syrian Army assassinated four top security officials, including Assad's brother-in-law, at a meeting in a military compound a few hundred metres from the presidential residence. In response Assad forces dramatically intensified their artillery bombardment of several districts of Damascus making life unpredictable and dangerous, and provoking an exodus of tens of thousands from Damascus across the border into Lebanon. We joined that search for safety because there were clear risks of a dramatic escalation of the conflict. We spent 10 days in Beirut waiting for a break in the fighting so we could return and pack our things. There is a high risk that the conflict will become an increasingly sectarian proxy war with, on the Assad regime's side, Shia Iran, Iraq, and Hizbullah, backed by Russia and China; and supporting the opposition, Sunni Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey backed by the US, Britain and France. This is a civil war which could last years and take countless lives. On the day we left, Zenobia and I reached the airport in time to catch one of the last Etihad flights out before the airline stopped its Damascus service. As the aircraft swung south over the parched August desert towards Abu Dhabi, my thoughts turned to the wonderful Syrians who had proudly shared their beautiful, ancient and romantic Damascus with us for three and a half years. Though many Syrian friends who had the means had already left the country, and others had escaped on study grants overseas, I was leaving most behind to face a violent and uncertain future. It seems the price Syrians will pay to achieve their freedom from a corrupt, brutal and inept dictatorship will far outweigh that paid by their awakened Arab counterparts in the region.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77c9fd4719c8552165731d"},"header":" Syria war explained: Who is Bashar al-Assad?  ","time":"Saturday, 18 August 2018","content":" The brutal dictator behind one of the worst atrocities the world has seen this century got the job by accident. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was originally destined for a career in medicine, according to news.com.au. But after his older brother Bassel was killed in a car crash in 1994, the younger Assad found himself being groomed for a completely different career. Bashar was studying ophthalmology in London when his father Hafez, the president, recalled his son home to start learning the tricks of the trade. When his father died in 2000, many hoped the educated and westernised Bashar would bring the long awaited economic and political reform Syrians demanded. But it never happened and instead of being regarded as a revered leader, he now finds himself accused of war crimes, locked in a bitter civil war with rebels and battling Islamic State militants. The al-Assad family has held power in Syria since 1971. First it was Hafez al-Assad, then Bashar who has ruled since his father's death. According to the Lowy Institute's Middle East expert Dr Rodger Shanahan, Hafez brought about stability after years of coups, but said this came at a huge cost and resulted in autocratic rule. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians and people in the west hoped Bashar would bring change. \"He had the education, was comfortable with the west and had the glamorous wife,\" Dr Shanahan said. But that didn't happen and in 2011, the Arab Spring uprising was taking hold across the region. Dr Shanahan said many Syrians grew frustrated not just by the military influence but also at the apparent power close confidants had with the government. \"You can't open up free speech in a closed political system,\" he said. Asma al-Assad was raised in Britain by Syrian parents. Educated and glamorous, she worked as an investment banker before meeting her future husband in Britain in 2000 - just months before he became president. From an elite Sunni family, her Muslim faith was also crucial - the Assads are Alawite and Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni. As Syria's First Lady, she was regarded as a style icon and received early praise for her progressive position on women's rights and education. The couple have three children. Assad has positioned himself as the lesser of evils in Syria and more legitimate and stable than the rebels and jihadists. But his oppressive rule has been marked by appalling human rights violations and by silencing dissent. One of Assad's first orders of business after coming to power was ushering in the Damascus Spring, a period of free expression, the release of political prisoners and sweeping economic reforms. But the hopeful new era met a quick end by 2001, when the government cracked down on the political forums that had been thriving. Assad soon retreated to older styles of repression and relied on the secret security police to enforce his demands. A decade of repression and human rights abuses followed. The media is state-controlled, the internet is censored and Syria remains a de facto single-party state with only Assad's Ba'ath Party holding effective power. The Assad regime has also been accused of using barrel bombs to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure, something Assad has denied. Assad is also suspected of green-lighting the sarin gas attack that killed more than 1400 civilians in 2013. Most recently, an Amnesty International report revealed 13,000 were secretly hanged at a military-run Saydnaya prison in Syria. The Assad government also came under the spotlight last week after horrific footage shocked the world after a chemical attack killed more than 80 people in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province. The Assads are not religiously extreme but belong to the Alawites strand of Islam. While Syrians were not protesting against religious extremists, like in other Arab Spring countries, they were angry that long-promised economic and political reforms failed to eventuate. In 2011, protests erupted in the southern Syrian city of Daraa following the detention of a group of boys who were accused of painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of their school. Security forces opened fire, killing four people in the first deaths of the uprising. Demonstrations soon spread sparking a crackdown by Assad's forces. By July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) had formed and the country slid into civil war. Assad is facing a fight on two fronts, first with the rebels and secondly with Islamic State who have lost much territory in Syria, including the strategic and historic site of Palmyra. And the messy, long and complicated war isn't just a case of brave rebels versus an evil dictator either. The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed from a combination of jihadists, some from Syria and others from elsewhere. Quite a lot actually. By August 2013, rebel forces began to weaken thanks to poor co-ordination and infighting. IS fighters clashed with the rebels, establishing a presence in Aleppo. By December that year, the government began an unprecedented campaign of dropping barrel bombs and IS expanded its presence in the eastern part of city. But by the following month rebel forces united against IS, driving the extremists out of Aleppo. But government forces exploited the fighting to push the rebels back. More than 55,000 jihadists had also been killed in the fighting so far, most of them from the Islamic State group or former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham Front. The Syrian government controls all the provincial capitals expect Raqqa and Idlib. The rest of Syria is controlled by rebels, Islamic State or Kurdish forces. Dr Shanahan said that depends on who you ask. Domestically he's generally favoured by the Alawites who have prospered and hold many key roles in the military and other government departments. Other religious minorities including Christians and urban middle class Sunnis have also largely supported him. Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response. Hafez al-Assad played the political game by redirecting resistance against Israel which won him support and funding from the Gulf countries. But Dr Shanahan said he felt the winds of change shifting and ended up supporting the west in the Gulf war. Bashar has fallen out of favour with the Saudis and also with Turkey. But millions of others have suffered. Across the Middle East, Assad is viewed with a mixed response.

However if allies Iran and Russia withdraw their support that could be a different story. \"The US has said their first priority in Syria is getting rid of the Islamic State and until that changes, I don't see this situation changing anytime soon,\" he said.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=11836518","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:25:47.519Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

READ MORE: • United States and allies launch airstrikes on Syria, President Donald Trump announces • Prime Minister on Syria strike: NZ accepts why strike happened​ Here's a look at how it started, why it became so complicated and what might happen next, reports the Washington Post. In March 2011, peaceful protests broke out around the country as part of the Arab Spring uprisings. Organizers called on Syrian President Bashar Assad to make democratic reforms, but his government responded with violence. In response, some of the protesters teamed up with military defectors to form the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group that wanted to overthrow the government. By 2012, this armed struggle had devolved into a full-blown civil war. Russia has long supported Assad's government. According to one scholar, Russia helped build the modern Syrian military, and Assad is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strongest allies in the Middle East. Russia has often blocked meaningful international action on Syria by vetoing proposals at the U.N. Security Council, and Moscow changed the course of the war in Assad's favor with a military intervention in 2015. The United States has been reluctant to become too entangled in Syria, but it has acted for two main reasons. First, the Islamic State began developing a foothold in the country in 2013. The next year, the United States launched airstrikes against the militant group. It eventually sent ground troops into the fight, and about 2,000 U.S. forces are now deployed there. Second, the United States has acted to punish the Assad government for using chemical weapons such as sarin and chlorine gas on Syrian civilians. In 2012, President Barack Obama called the use of chemical weapons a \"red line\" that would prompt military intervention. The following year, a sarin gas attack in Eastern Ghouta killed about 1,400 people, according to the U.S. government's assessment. Obama pushed for a strike but couldn't get congressional approval. Instead, he came up with a diplomatic solution. The U.N. Security Council ordered Assad to destroy his chemical weapons stockpile and sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits countries from producing, stockpiling or using chemical weapons. There have been several reports of chemical weapons attacks since then. One particularly bad strike took place April 4, 2017. Nearly 100 people were killed in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun in an apparent sarin attack. It garnered worldwide headlines and the attention of President Trump, who expressed horror at the images of \"innocent children, innocent babies\" poisoned by a nerve agent. Just a few days after that attack, Trump authorized a cruise-missile strike on a Syrian air base. It was the first direct U.S. strike on the Syrian regime in the war. One of Assad's key allies is Iran. Iran needs Syria to move its weapons and proxy militias across the Middle East. So when Assad seemed threatened, Iran stepped in to support him. So did Hezbollah, the Lebanese political party and militia that is a close ally of Tehran. That upset Iran's rivals in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. So they began sending arms and money to anti-Assad rebels, including extremist militias. Israel's begun attacking Assad bases with airstrikes. That means that today, there are many wars being fought inside Syria. The Syrian government is still at war with the rebels. Israel is at war with Iranian-backed forces. And the United States is trying to kill off the Islamic State. Horrible. Syrian families often don't have basic necessities, like food, shelter and medical care. Children can't go to school. The war is being fought in towns and on the streets. Since the start of the war, more than 465,000 Syrians have been killed, 1 million more have been injured, and 12 million - more than half the country's population - have been forced to flee their homes. More than 5.5 million have moved abroad and registered as refugees.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12032977","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:26:01.178Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

","time":"Saturday, 18 August 2018","content":" For Donald Trump, ratings, approval and support are a big deal. The US President has frequently disputed that his election opponent won more votes than he did and his predecessor drew a bigger inauguration crowd. He has taken time out from the biggest job on the planet to feud on Twitter with Arnold Schwarzenegger over ratings for The Apprentice. During a speech to Congress, his idea of offering comfort to a dead Navy Seal's widow after she received a standing ovation was to say her husband was \"very happy, because I think he just broke a record\". So, weeks of job approval ratings, chronically low for a new US president, must have been hard to stomach. Gallup figures showing Trump at 37 and 38 per cent approval have been widely shared among politicos on the President's social media of choice, Twitter. And polls showed sliding support among groups of voters for Trump and his policies. When combined with daily doses of bad news about the Russia investigation, stalled healthcare reform, legal blocks to immigration moves, insider leaking and Trump Administration chaos, it was clear change was required. Unpopularity makes it harder for a president to push through programmes and easier for opponents to obstruct. The story of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, illustrated in ever-widening web lines in graphics, has become the President's own email server saga millstone. What could shift it? On Friday, as US cruise missiles punched holes in hangars on the Syria regime's Shayrat base, a widely-shared Trump tweet from October 9, 2012 hinted at a possible parallel playing out: \"Now that Obama's poll numbers are in tailspin - watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate.\" Trump's cruise missile strikes days after an apparent chemical weapons attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun need to be seen in the context of his domestic political woes and his background on the Syrian civil war. Eleven weeks into his presidency, Trump is attempting a reset, trying to boost his popularity and control the agenda. He wants to change the conversation from the Russia probe and the allegation he is President Vladimir Putin's puppet. The strikes are part of it, so is generally creating a perception of 'winning', being decisive, being taken more seriously, presenting messages more competently and having the right advisers. So far, in the past few days, it is working. REACTION TO THE RETALIATION Although the speed of the retaliation was a surprise, the action wasn't to pundits who have seen it all before from previous leaders. Harvard professor Stephen Walt tweeted on Thursday: \"I don't know what Trump will do re Syria. But I'm betting it will be some loud, well-publicised, and strategically meaningless airstrikes.\" With the missile strikes, Trump has had the best couple of days of his presidency. On the face of it, he has taken unusually quick, decisive action on an issue that gives him a chance to show empathy and people generally agree on. The taboo on chemcal weapons is worth upholding, right? Both the Washington establishment and mainstream US media have largely been sympathetic. A poll boost is sure to follow. Foreign leaders have expressed support. His former opponent Hillary Clinton in an interview on Friday called for strikes against Syrian airfields. The Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \"the era of American passivity is over\". Democrat leader in the House Nancy Pelosi called Trump's strikes a \"proportional response\". Former Obama Administration ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, called them \"correct and well executed\". The New York Times and Guardian ran story-behind-the-story articles which bolstered Trump's assertion that he was spurred into action by footage of Syria's suffering people and depicted him as a man of action. The New York Times: \"Trump was already shaken by photos his staff had shown him of children dying ... so the President did not need a lot of convincing ... aides say the images from Syria - especially those showing the suffering of small children and babies - weigh on him ... The first public evidence of the President's concern about the chemical attack comes ... Trump says his horror at the images of 'innocent children, innocent babies' choked by poison gas in the attack has led him to reassess his approach to Syria.\" The Guardian: \"The images had a profound effect on the US President ... 'I will tell you that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me - big impact,' Trump told reporters ... Trump had criticised Obama for vacillation and weakness. Would he act differently? Within 24 hours Trump's flexibility had translated into direct action ... After weeks in which his Administration had seemed consumed by leaks, in fighting, drift and ineptitude, Trump was moving at speed.\" CNN ran a report with the extremely Trump-friendly headline: \"These are the images that moved President Trump to act in Syria\". Daily Beast and CNN commentator Matt Lewis tweeted: \"Trump can punish Assad, deter future use of chemical weapons, send a message to the world, \u0026 still avoid the mess of regime change.\" Presenter with Britain's Channel 4 Matt Frei tweeted: \"With Syria strikes @realDonaldTrump showed 1he can act decisively 2not Russia's puppet 3not Obama 4has humanitarian reflex5 unpredictable.\" As MSNBC host Chris Hayes noted: \"Tonight Trump is getting praise from the very same Establishment he ran against and whose approval he desperately seeks.\" The circumstances surrounding the President's crisis point were significant.Trump dealt with the Syria issue while hosting the Chinese President Xi Jinping. He received a major Congressional victory with the Senate confirming Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. And various reports emerged of a staff shake-up, with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Stephen Bannon said to be in trouble. The staffing reports had Trump ordering his aides to sort it out. The message being, man in charge is putting that infighting behind him. TRUMP'S BIG U-TURN ON SYRIA According to the Daily Beast, there had been nine previous suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria this year, with toxic chlorine gas, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Trump Administration had shown no previous desire to take retalitory action. And what about deaths caused by conventional weapons? Remember the agonising fall of Aleppo late last year? Trump's team has been trying hard to get a ban on Syrian refugees - fleeing their brutal dictator - from entering the US. Before he became president, Trump said numerous times in 2013 and 2014 that the US should not bomb Syria. In 2013 former President Barack Obama declared chemical weapon use a red line and then backed down from taking military action in the face of popular and Congressional opposition. In August 2013, chemical weapons were used against people in Ghouta, killing about 1300. Trump tweeted: \"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long-term conflict?\" And: \"President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your 'powder' for another (and more important) day!\" Acting on the latest atrocity - thought to involve sarin gas - gave Trump a chance to shape up in comparison to Obama. Yesterday, press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted a photo of Trump and team at a briefing in what was clearly meant to mirror the famous picture of Obama and officials during the Osama bin Laden raid. Washington Post blogger Paul Waldman tweeted: \"In these foreign policy crises, almost impossible to overestimate the role Trump's desire 2B tougher than Obama will play in his decisions\". Trump called it a \"targeted\" strike \"on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread of chemical weapons\". Syria denies using nerve gas. Trump's speech sounded very much like something George W. Bush could have delivered. \"My fellow Americans\", \"no child of God\", \"end the slaughter\", \"we pray for God's wisdom\", \"America stands for justice\". The only Trumpian note in it was \"beautiful babies\". Trump's sudden concern for Syrians is problematic whether taken at face value or not. Firstly, it is a convenient phenomenon that we can only take his word for. Secondly, it only seems to apply to Syrians killed by chemical weapons. Thirdly, it goes against his background statements and actions towards Syrian refugees. Fourthly, is it a good thing that the President can suddenly change course based on an emotional, gut reaction? Also, as Micah Zenko of the Council of Foreign Relations tweeted: \"That Trump was moved by graphic images to OK the attack won't be lost on all threatened groups seeking US intervention on their behalf.\" WHAT DID THE STRIKES ACHIEVE? For many people hoping for progress in ending the Syrian civil war, none of that will matter. The war is a gaping wound in the world which has destabilised the region and wider Europe. It is a complex conflict seemingly without end that has left people for years looking on feeling frustrated and helpless, or angry at the displaced millions. In reactions to the US strikes, a lot of people commenting on media and social media seemed to be uploading their own emotional projections about the war onto Trump's actions. Some people saw it as appropriate, limited, punishment for the Khan Sheikhoun attack. There was relief from Syrians that the Assad regime had finally taken a hit from the US. Perhaps more would follow. Long-time Syria watchers believed it was strategically good that Trump had demonstrated that military force was on the table. Obama's unwillingness to battle Bashar al-Assad as well as Isis had been seen as prolonging the war. Perhaps this has opened the door to intervention against the regime after the quarantined approach. Some saw Trump as refilling the Rubicon to deter future use of chemical weapons.Other people focused on whether the strikes were legal, or whether they sent a wider warning to North Korea and China, or whether the US was just repeating ineffective history. Some right-wing supporters of Trump were disappointed that he was not the isolationist they had believed in. It was quickly clear that the strikes were limited in scope and largely symbolic: A mini shock and awe. By Friday night NZT Reuters and AFP were reporting that planes were already using the base to take off on bombing raids in the countryside. By yesterday Khan Sheikhoun was being bombed again. Reports quickly surfaced on Friday from the BBC and ABC that Russians and Syrians were evacuated from the airbase before the strike. The Pentagon confirmed that Russia was notified in advance. Al Jazeera America producer Tony Karon tweeted: \"For anyone who thinks this is start of a war to topple Assad, note the care taken to minimise risk to his forces at target site\". Moscow has promised to strengthen Syria's anti-aircraft defences. It is also suspending a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their planes in Syria. Today Russia sent a warship to boost its battlegroup off the Syrian coast. Considering how both Trump and Putin would benefit from more perceived independence from each other, just how coordinated were the strikes? It is impossible to know just yet. Eurasia Group political scientist Ian Bremmer tweeted: \"Assad gas attack vigorously denied by Kremlin \u0026 makes Putin looks weak v Assad (Iran matters..). US-Russia heading for trouble\". Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland smells a scam. \"How convenient that Trump, under fire for being Vladimir Putin's poodle, now stands up to him in Syria. How neatly this blows away all those allegations of secret links and election hacking. Yes, there have been ample statements of condemnation from Moscow, but those don't cost either side anything. The US appears to have given Russia sufficient warning to ensure their men weren't hit, and Russia used none of its ample capacity to hit back. It all worked out very nicely.\" HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO THEY CARRY? There has been a lot of debate on how much weight these strikes carry. If it is too obviously organised military theatre then can it really enforce a warning to the Syrian regime? Is Trump almost guaranteed to have to go further at some stage? And should Trump suddenly be seen as a 'strong' leader, having dropped 59 cruise missiles worth US$59 million, after decades of war. Zenko tweeted: \"US dropped 26,172 bombs in 2016. How does 59 more suddenly demonstrate US 'resolve,' 'credibility,' + 'leadership?'\" New York Times journalist Max Fisher wrote in a series of tweets: \"Still confused by argument that the US established anti-CW deterrence by demonstrating it will retaliate with negligibly damaging strikes. If this was executed competently and Russia given warnings, then strikes appear largely symbolic. Little impact on regime or its calculus. How exactly did these US strikes establish deterrence? Is this 'punishment' sufficient to change anything?\" Josh Barro of Business Insider asked: \"If you openly signal that the attack was symbolic, doesn't that undermine the symbolism?\" Naval War College professor Tom Nichols tweeted: \"This looks like a pinprick. It pops the balloon of thinking Syria is untouchable, but whether it deters anything is less clear.\" Former US Treasury terror finance analyst Jonathan Schanzer tweeted: \"FWIW, I think a limited, proportional response is a good first move. Doesn't solve Syria, but lets Assad/Iran know we are watching.\" Clifford May of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies tweeted: \"Also let's Russia know we're back in the game. N Korea, too, can no longer bank on US inaction, 'soft power' and talking as only responses.\" WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? For many experts the 'what's next' question is key. University of Maryland professor Shibley Telhami tweeted: \"Within days, Trump's strike will look more and more ineffective, forcing a decision: escalate or live with perception of failure.\" Writer Max Boot tweeted: \"Now what? Is message that US will tolerate Assad as long as he doesn't use CW? Or is this prelude to larger strategy in Syria? If so what?\" Former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said that \"Trump biggest worry now; what if Assad defies him and uses chemical weapons again?\" Head of Foreign Policy Group, David Rothkopf, tweeted: \"Problem re: Trump \u0026 mil action is - he's impulsive and not strategic. Taking such action absent clear policies is where biggest risks arise. The 'what's next' component of Syria strike will reveal much about effectiveness \u0026 thinking of Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster, Pompeo team.\" Zenko said a 'rosy scenario' could see Assad deterred without the US being drawn further into the civil war. But he said \"I looked at 36 cases of limited US strikes: They achieve military goals 1/2 the time; political goals less than 10%.\" A Middle East veteran writer, Sam Dagher, tweeted: \"Without plan to remove Assad from power US strikes strengthen him as leader confronting Trump aggression.\" The editor of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, compared the President with his predecessor: \"Obama was known for an overly cerebral commitment to the notion of strategic patience. Trump seems more committed to a policy of glandular, non-strategic impatience. Obama may have been paralysed by a phobic reaction to the threat posed by the slippery slope. Donald Trump now finds himself dancing at the edge of the slippery slope his predecessor so assiduously avoided.\"","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=11835015","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:26:15.901Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Foreign Minister Murray McCully said the money would go to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been helping evacuate civilians from Aleppo. \"New Zealanders are appalled at the ongoing death and destruction in Syria and the conditions on the ground in besieged areas such as east Aleppo,\" McCully said. \"During our time on the United Nations Security Council, New Zealand has actively pushed for greater humanitarian access and a political resolution to the Syrian crisis, and it was a key focus of our presidency of the council in September.\" The latest contribution brought New Zealand's direct support for people forced from their homes because of conflicts in Syria and Iraq to more than $26 million since 2012.In June Cabinet agreed to increase New Zealand's annual refugee quota from 750 to 1000, which will cost $20.6 million a year in the long-run. NGOs have strongly lobbied for the refugee quota to be at least doubled, a position that had broad support among other parties in Parliament. The Syrian government took full control of Aleppo on Thursday for the first time in four years after the last opposition fighters and civilians were bussed out of war-ravaged eastern districts, sealing the end of the rebellion's most important stronghold. The evacuations ended a brutal chapter in Syria's nearly six-year civil war, allowing President Bashar Assad to regain full authority over the country's largest city and former commercial powerhouse. It marked his most significant victory since an uprising against his family's four-decade rule began in 2011. Under a deal brokered by Russia and Turkey, tens of thousands of residents and fighters began evacuating to opposition-controlled areas in the surrounding countryside, a process that took a week. More than 35,000 fighters and civilians were bussed out, according to the United Nations. The Red Cross said more than 4000 additional fighters were evacuated in private cars, vans and trucks since Wednesday. - additional reporting AP","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1\u0026objectid=11772256","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:26:39.346Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77ca3f4719c85521657325"},"header":" Things are moving fast in Syria. Here are answers to 7 key questions about the conflict  ","time":"Saturday, 18 August 2018","content":" Things are moving fast - crazy fast - in Syria. Last weekend, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated, publicly, that the U.S. would no longer push for Syrian President Bashar Assad to be removed from power. On Tuesday, Assad forces allegedly attacked a town in Idlib province with sarin gas, killing 80. By Friday, the Trump administration was bombing a Syrian airbase and threatening a coalition-led effort to oust the embattled Syrian leader. Here are seven key points for understanding this dramatic shift in policy: Q. Why would Assad use chemical weapons in the first place? Didn't he know that he would provoke the United States to intervene?A. In short: He's running out of options. As Andrew J. Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy explained, Assad has just 18,000 deployable forces and his government controls only a third of the country. That means his army is stretched very thin. Additionally, he's being pressured by the Russians to go on the offensive. They especially want him to press eastward, so that if/when Raqqa falls out of the hands of the Islamic State, his army will be there to pick up the pieces. \"He's stretched his forces too thin,\" Tabler told me. \"And he's begun losing ground\" in the area where the sarin attack was perpetrated Tuesday. Assad doesn't have the forces he needs to retake that region, so he turned to his stash of chemical weapons. And although chemical weapons have provoked a strong international outcry in the past, Assad probably thought he could get away with it. He probably thought that, Tabler says, because that's what Putin told him. As Tabler explains, U.S. officials say there were Russian soldiers at the air base from which the sarin attack was allegedly launched. \"I think Assad and the Russians thought they had carte blanche,\" Tabler says. \"They were wrong. \" Q. Why did the United States decide to attack after staying out of the conflict for six years?A. It's hard to puzzle out exactly what changed for the Trump administration, which has disavowed military intervention in the Middle East on several occasions. Just this week, Tillerson told reporters that removing Assad was not a priority. He was echoing comments made by United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and even White House press secretary Sean Spicer. They made these statements knowing that Assad had used chemical weapons at least three times since 2013, when a sarin gas attack killed more than 1,000 people. But if you listen to the president, it had everything to do with the pictures. On Tuesday, 80 people were killed by a sarin attack perpetrated by the Assad government. (Assad's government disputes that charge.) On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that he'd been deeply affected by the pictures coming out of Idlib province. The images showed, in Trump's words, \"beautiful little babies\" lying dead on the ground, suffocated by a chemical agent. Trump called the attack an \"affront to humanity.\" By Thursday, he was saying that \"something should happen\" to Assad because of his responsibility for the attack. Q. What did the United States target Syria's Shayrat air base? And what did the attacks really accomplish? A. Thursday night, the U.S. military launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield. Why'd they choose the airfield, and not, say, one of the places where Assad's chemical weapons are stored? That's pretty easy: Shayrat, in Homs province, is the base that apparently launched the chemical attack in Idlib. The U.S. missiles targeted air defenses, aircraft, hangars and fuel storage sites. The U.S. military said initial indications were that the strike had \"severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure,\" though that's hard to independently verify. Syrian officials say the strikes also killed seven people, including four children. Nine others were wounded, according to state media reports. As one local told the BBC, the blasts from the strike were \"massive.\" He thinks civilians living nearby could well have been killed. Q. Iran and Russia condemned the attack. What do they stand to lose?A. The war in Syria is a civil war, but it's also a proxy war, being fought by many, many, many other countries. And the places with the most to lose if Assad falls? Russia and Iran. Moscow is Assad's key international ally, and has provided the Syrian leader with unconditional diplomatic backing. Since September, Russia has provided direct military support as well. Experts say it's conducted more than 500 airstrikes against rebel-held forces. Russia's motivations are myriad -- involvement in Syria makes the country a major player in the Middle East, and protects Russia's only Mediterranean military base. It also gives Russia a way to play international peacekeeper. Iran, too, has more than 2,000 troops bolstering the Syrian army, though Tehran publicly denies being involved. Iran's motivation for helping Assad are also wrapped up in its regional ambitions. Iran is the Middle East's most powerful Shiite state, and it looks to bolster other Shiite regimes, like Assad's government. Iran is also deeply concerned about the rise of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, Sunni terrorist groups that have targeted Shiite Muslims in the past. \"If Syria falls, Iran will have to fight these groups within its borders,\" an expert told Al Jazeera in 2016. Q. Why didn't President Barack Obama do something similar after Assad used sarin on civilians in 2013? A. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama was confronted with a similar choice. A sarin attack on the outskirts of Damascus killed more than 1,000 people, including 400 children. The Assad government was allegedly to blame. And Obama had already drawn a \"red line,\" promising to attack if chemical weapons were deployed. After the Ghouta assault, the president considered a targeted military response. But Congress was unwilling to authorize the strike. So instead, the president sought out diplomatic alternatives. With an assist from Russia, he made progress -- at the end of 2013, Assad agreed to destroy his country's massive stockpile of chemical weapons and also agreed to United Nations monitoring. By June 2014, he had largely complied. In truth, though, Obama was always deeply reluctant to intervene in Syria, concerned about getting the U.S. entangled in another intractable war As the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg explained: \"In 2013, Obama feared, not without justification, the second- and third-order consequences of an American missile strike on the regime. Even before he became president, Obama worried greatly about slippery slopes in the Middle East. In Syria, he understood that Assad would most likely survive an American missile strike on his airbases; the day after such strikes ended, Assad, Obama believed, would have emerged from his hiding place, and declared victory: The greatest power in the world tried to destroy him, and failed. Obama was acutely aware that a one-off strike (a theoretical strike described as 'unbelievably small' by his secretary of state, John Kerry), could possibly have served as a convincing brush-back pitch, but he was also aware that such a limited strike could have been wholly ineffectual, and even counterproductive. Assad and his allies, understanding that the appetite of average Americans for yet another Middle Eastern war was limited, could have tried to provoke Obama into escalation. An all-out war against the Syrian regime would have been, in many ways, Obama's Iraq. And Obama wasn't interested in having his own Iraq.\" Even in 2016, Obama told Goldberg that he was \"very proud of this moment.\" Q. Aren't U.S. forces already already bombing targets in Syria?A. Yup. In 2014, the United States began a military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. U.S. planes have bombed hundreds of targets over the past two years. There are also hundreds of U.S. troops on the ground near Raqqa, helping rebel groups prepare an offensive on the city, which is controlled by the Islamic State. Some experts are warning that Trump's attacks will make America's assault on the Islamic State harder. As Andrew Exum wrote in the Atlantic: \"For the past two years, U.S. and coalition aircraft have flown in and around one of the world's more robust air defense systems without the Syrian regime harassing the pilots. We had a few incidents where Russian jets got too close to U.S. aircraft or Syrian anti-aircraft radar lit up U.S. or coalition aircraft, but for the most part, the air war has gone forward unimpeded. \"Both Russia and the Syrian regime, though, are still well-positioned to play the spoiler. They can affect the flights of U.S. aircraft in eastern Syria by activating their air defenses and have, in recent months, brought in more advanced air-defense weaponry that has even the Israelis nervous. They've also 'accidentally' struck U.S.-backed rebel groups fighting the Islamic State.\" Putin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov said the strikes represent a \"significant blow\" to American-Russian ties. Friday morning, Russia said that it was suspending its pact with Washington to share information about warplane missions over Syria. The pact had protected U.S.-led coalition forces waging airstrikes against Islamic State targets within the country. Q. Is this attack a big deal? Could it escalate into some kind of horrible America/Russia World War III situation? A. Honestly, probably not. Thursday night's strike does not change the reality on the ground in Syria. It does not greatly impact Assad's military capabilities. It won't lead to any kind of regime change, at least not without a significantly broader U.S. military intervention. It probably also won't hurt America's (admittedly frosty) relationship with Russia in the long term. Sure, Russian officials blustered this morning. But behind the scenes, the country seemed willing to give the administration a pass, particularly because the U.S. made sure no Russians were hurt. What's scary - really, truly scary - is what this says about Trump's temperament. Earlier this week, Tillerson, Haley and Spicer all offered some variation on a theme: Assad would, and should, stay in power. Ousting him was not a U.S. priority. That seemed to jive with Trump's own statements during the campaign, when he called the Iraq war stupid and promised not to get entangled in the Middle East. (It also contradicts Trumps 2013 position. After the sarin attack in Ghotta, Trump wrote: AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN \u0026 FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING! Here are 17 other times he's made a similar claim.) Now, just four days later, the Trump administration has done a 180. What's changed? The president saw some really upsetting pictures on television, and felt moved to act. Having a change of heart is not the same thing as having a plan, however. Syria's civil war is one of the most complicated foreign policy problems in the world. A dozen countries are now embroiled in the outcome. And if Assad goes, it's not clear what comes next. Best-case scenario: Syria is Iraq. Worst case, it's Yemen: violent, fractured, and fertile ground for terrorists. There's no evidence that Trump has grappled, in the past few days, with what the Syrian people need, and what the United States can and should invest. At a news conference Thursday, he offered this assessment: \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity. He's there and I guess he's running things, so something should happen.\" As long as America's Syria strategy is that \"something should happen,\" Syrian children (and adults) will keep dying in horrible, brutal, utterly inhumane ways. Assad will stay in power, and he'll keep killing his people with impunity. Russia and Iran will continue their proxy wars while terror cells consolidate power. In other words: Syria was a mess yesterday. It's a mess today. It'll be a mess tomorrow, too. And Trump can do very little to change that reality.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=11835153","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:26:53.719Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) says it estimates the cost of the material destruction — damage to roads, infrastructure, homes and other physical objects — is $120 billion. It says the cost of lost productivity — or losses to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) — is $268 billion. The agency convened a two-day conference in Beirut on of Syrian and international experts to discuss Syria's reconstruction on Tuesday and Wednesday. Monitoring groups say at least 400,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war. More than 11 million others — or half of Syria's pre-war population — have been displaced from their homes, according to the U.N., including more than 5 million who have been made refugees abroad. President Bashar Assad's forces continue to press their battles against rebels and Islamic State group insurgents in pockets around northwest and south Syria while refusing a U.N.-mediated political settlement to end the war. ___ 2:20 p.m. Syrian activists say military helicopters have dropped leaflets over parts of the northwestern rebel-held province of Idlib, calling on residents to reconcile with the government. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights posted a copy of the leaflets. They say the Syrian war \"is close to an end,\" that it's time to stop the bloodletting and that residents should join reconciliation \"as our people did in other parts of Syria.\" Activists say simultaneously as the helicopters dropped leaflets on Thursday, warplanes pounded several rebel-held areas elsewhere in Idlib, which has become home to tens of thousands of internally displaced people. Idlib is the last left major rebel-held region in Syria and there are concerns that a government offensive would displace hundreds of thousands of people inside the province bordering Turkey.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12104491","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:27:06.853Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Assad told The Mail on Sunday that Western nations have lied about chemical attacks in Syria and supported terrorists groups there, while Russia has supported his government against the foreign \"invasion.\" Assad reiterated his long-held position that the uprising against his rule was part of a plot to remove a leader that did not go along with Western policies in the region. Syria is allied with Iran and Russia, and has had turbulent relations with the West. Syria is technically at war with Israel, which occupies the Syrian Golan Heights, but a cease-fire has largely held since the 1970s. \"The whole approach toward Syria in the West is, 'we have to change this government; we have to demonize this president, because they don't suit our policies anymore.'\" Assad said. \"They tell lies, they talk about chemical weapons. They talk about the bad president killing good people, freedom and peaceful demonstrations.\" Syria's conflict began in 2011 with peaceful protests against the Assad family's decades-long rule. The government's violent response to the protests, and the eventual rise of an armed insurgency, tipped the country into a civil war that has claimed nearly half a million lives. Since then, Western nations and independent experts have accused the government of carrying out several chemical weapons attacks, most recently in April, in an attack near Damascus that reportedly killed dozens of people and prompted Western airstrikes. The government has denied ever using chemical weapons. Assad also dismissed reports that Israel has conducted recent airstrikes in Syria with tacit Russian cooperation. Russia has provided crucial military support to Assad's forces, waging an air campaign since 2015 that turned the tide of the war in Assad's favor. Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah group have also provided extensive military support. \"Russia never coordinated with anyone against Syria, either politically or militarily,\" Assad said. \"How could they help the Syrian Army advancing and at the same time work with our enemies in order to destroy our army?\" Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes against Iranian forces in Syria last month. The lack of any Russian response, despite the heavy Russian presence in the skies over Syria, suggested that Moscow might have been notified ahead of time. Assad said he has remained in office through more than seven years of war because he has \"public support.\" \"We are fighting the terrorists, and those terrorists are supported by the British government, the French government, the Americans and their puppets whether in Europe or in our region,\" he said. \"We are fighting them, and we have public support in Syria to fight those terrorists. That's why we are advancing. We cannot make these advances just because we have Russian and Iranian support.\" In recent weeks, the Syrian government and its allies have made considerable military gains, including bringing the entire capital and its suburbs under full government control for the first time since the war began. Some areas in the north are controlled by the Turkish military and its Syrian allies and others in the northeast are run by U.S.-backed Syrian forces. Rebel fighters remain in control of most of Idlib province in the northwest and parts of southern Syria. On Sunday, activists and a war monitor said at least 10 people were killed in airstrikes in Taftanaz, a town in northeastern Idlib province. The Syrian Civil Defense, known as White Helmets, said the killed included four children and one woman and that those killed were all at the local pediatric hospital that got hit in the airstrike. The Observatory and an activist-run media center in Taftanaz said the hospital was put out of order struck. At least five others were killed in the nearby towns of Binnish, Ariha and Ram Hemdan, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12068111","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:27:18.373Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Security Council Russia's support of the Assad regime is \"destroying innocent lives\". The strong condemnation was made at an emergency meeting called to discuss worsening violence in Syria and as government planes bomb the city of Aleppo. And it comes as Prime Minister John Key says Russian president Vladimir Putin's ego is driving much of his country's policy on the conflict. The United States has accused Russia of \"barbarism\", and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it may have committed war crimes. VIDEO: John Key: Syrian President has got to go A ceasefire between the Syrian Government and rebel forces collapsed last week when an aid convoy was bombed. Fighting has since intensified in Aleppo, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped. The Syrian airforce push to capture the rebel-controlled areas of the city has Russian and Iranian support and there are reports of thousands of civilian casualties. New Zealand's Acting Ambassador Carolyn Schwalger chaired the Security Council emergency meeting and told members New Zealand \"demands that the Syrian Government immediately cease its bombing of civilians and demonstrate genuine commitment to achieving a negotiated peace\". All countries but particularly those with most influence over the Syrian Government should do the same, Schwalger said in the unusually blunt statement. \"I speak in particular to those whose political and material support is making the Syrian Government's current actions possible. \"Your support is undermining any remaining prospects for the peace process. And it is destroying innocent lives under the guise of countering terrorism.\" Syria needed to ground its planes and hold back its armies. \"New Zealand appeals to the governments of Russia and Iran - if you are serious about peace, do everything in your power in the coming days to halt the fighting and give the US-Russia arrangements a chance.\" Russia has blamed the ceasefire breakdown on the rebel forces, including those backed by the West, and says some groups in eastern Aleppo are holding the local population hostage and using them as human shields. Schwalger said New Zealand recognised that those opposed to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad also had responsibilities, and countries with influence on the opposition needing to encourage respect for the ceasefire and the disassociation with terrorist groups. \"However, what the Syrian Government and its allies are doing is making that disassociation harder and prolonging the war. \"All involved in Syria need to take a hard look at themselves and ask whether they intend to be genuine collaborators in the search for peace.\" It is New Zealand's turn to hold the Presidency of the Security Council this month and Prime Minister John Key is back in the country after travelling to New York where he chaired a heated Security Council debate on the Syria crisis. Schwalger referenced Key's statement, saying Security Council members in response agreed points including that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict, and the urgent need to stop the fighting. \"It is therefore with utter dismay that we find ourselves back in this Chamber as Syrian planes, reportedly with Russian support, inflict carnage on eastern Aleppo. \"These actions, reportedly including the use of incendiary and other indiscriminate weapons, are disturbing and demonstrate total disregard for their devastating impact on civilians.\" This morning, Key told Newstalk ZB the Syrian crisis was \"deeply frustrating\". \"You go back to 2010 people were holidaying there. Now you have half the entire population displaced, hundreds of people losing their lives, those scenes you see on your nightly tv screens of beautiful little children dying.\" Key said he believed the Russians did want a ceasefire but for different reasons to the West. \"A lot of it comes down to, A, backing their man Assad, B, proving they stand by their man Assad, but maybe the main thing is [Russian president] Vladimir Putin's ego - he wants to say, 'You want to get resolutions to issues, I'm your guy and come to Moscow.\" There was \"no long-term place for Assad\" as Syrian leader, Key said, but there would have to be a transition period if Russia was to support his ousting. \"This is a guy who has used chemical weapons against his own people, amongst everything else. He has to go.\" Save the Children has cited reports that about half of recent casualties in Aleppo were children.","url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1\u0026objectid=11716861","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:27:34.271Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Footage posted by the group online, which was not possible to verify, showed victims including children foaming at the mouth. There were conflicting reports on the number of dead in the alleged gas attack, with the White Helmets reporting between 40 and 70 killed.The Observatory said that 11 of those who died at the weekend, including four children, had suffered breathing problems after the raids. “These reports, if confirmed, are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “The Assad regime and its backers must be held accountable,” she said. “Russia, with its unwavering support for the regime, ultimately bears responsibility for these brutal attacks.”Pope Francis too have condemned the suspected attack. “Terrible news comes to us from Syria with dozens of victims, many of them women and children... so many people are struck by the effects of the chemical substances in the bombs,” the Pope told thousands of people gathered in St Peter's Square on April 8.The Syrian regime has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons, with the United Nations among those blaming government forces for a deadly sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun in April 2017.That attack prompted Washington to launch military strikes against a regime military base.Major General Yuri Yevtushenko, head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of the Warring Sides in Syria, denied the claims. “We are ready, once Douma is freed from militants, to immediately send Russian specialists in radiation, chemical and biological defence to collect data that will confirm these claims are fabricated,” he said in comments reported by Russian news agencies.On the morning of April 8, a civilian committee taking part in the talks between the rebels and Russia announced “a ceasefire and the resumption of talks today” hoping it will lead to a “final accord”.State news agency SANA also reported that talks would begin within several hours.Mr. Assad is keen to recapture Ghouta to eliminate the opposition from the outskirts of Damascus and end years of rocket fire on the capital. Since February 18, the regime’s Ghouta offensive has killed more than 1,600 civilians and sliced the area into three isolated pockets, each held by different rebel factions.The first two were evacuated under Russian-brokered deals that saw more than 46,000 rebels and civilians bussed to opposition-held Idlib Province in the northwest. Tens of thousands also fled into government-controlled territory through safe passages opened by Russia and Syrian troops.Moscow also stepped in to negotiate a deal for Douma, the third and final pocket where Jaish al-Islam had been angling for a reconciliation agreement that would allow its members to remain as a police force.Following a preliminary accord announced by Russia on April 1, nearly 3,000 fighters and civilians were evacuated from Douma to northern Syria. But as talks dragged on, Syria and Russia threatened Jaish al-Islam with a renewed military assault if the group did not agree to withdraw.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:57:43 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-air-strikes-hit-last-rebel-stronghold-of-douma-syria-civil-war-monitor/article23471554.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-air-strikes-hit-last-rebel-stronghold-of-douma-syria-civil-war-monitor/article23471554.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:27:47.176Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

However, the crisis is escalating with the regime beginning a new phase of the war in Idlib province, which is controlled by rebels and al-Qaeda-linked jihadists; Turkey sending troops across the border to fight the Kurdish rebels; and the U.S. seemingly determined to stay in Syria for a longer term. Like the first phase of the civil war, this phase is also multidirectional. The regime, backed by Iran and Russia, is fighting against the rebels and jihadists in Idlib, Eastern Ghouta, and some southern enclaves. Turkish proxies, backed by the air force, are attacking Kurdish militias in Afrin, a border town. The U.S., despite Turkey’s warnings, continues to support the Kurdish militias in several other towns in the border region.The downing of an Israeli fighter jet in Syria last week triggered this question once again. From the early phase of the civil war, Israel has been a passive player. In the initial stages, it backed rebels on the Golan side to create a buffer between the Golan Heights that have been occupied by Israel since 1967 and the Syrian mainland. With Iran and Hezbollah expanding their presence in Syria, Israel’s focus broadened to curtail their influence. Last week, an Israeli fighter jet was carrying out a raid against an Iranian drone control facility in Syrian deserts when it came under Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Following the incident, Israel has steadily enhanced its air campaign in Syria against what it calls “Iranian targets”.The conflict is becoming more complex with more powers intervening. Earlier, among external powers, only Russia and the U.S. were making direct interventions, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and Turkey all supporting their respective proxies. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies may have taken a beating after rebels lost Aleppo, but Turkish and Israeli jets are now carrying out airstrikes in Syria. Russia appears to be stuck in the conflict. Its heavy bombing campaign helped turn the war in favour of the regime, but its attempts to push the government to make concessions in peace talks have been a failure. With more powers in the war, finding a solution is becoming more complicated.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:57:56 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-many-conflicts-in-syria/article22754671.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-many-conflicts-in-syria/article22754671.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:27:59.709Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

A number of books deepen our understanding of this conflict. Syrian history over the last seven years can be best understood when seen in continuity from the Lebanese civil war; in turn, the Lebanese civil war can be explained better by going back to World War I when the French returned to Syria after the Treaty of Versailles and established Greater Lebanon. One book that I have repeatedly consulted in this regard is The War for Lebanon: 1970-1983 by Itamar Rabinovich. It is an excellent account of the first fully televised civil war of our times and captures the various phases of the conflict, starting with the U.S. intervention in Lebanon in 1958 and the setting up of the principal base of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Beirut in 1972. No civil war begins with a single move and the Lebanese civil war, which was partially driven by Syria’s unwillingness to surrender its sovereign rights to other regional powers, lasted for 15 years and set the template in the region. Today, while Lebanon remains on tenterhooks on account of the ongoing Syrian civil war, one needs to look at both Syria and Lebanon as two acts of a single play. Despite the years that have passed since its publication, Thomas L. Friedman’s From Beirut to Jerusalem remains a book of lasting importance and helps us understand the complex power play in a region that is shaped by religious and sectarian divide and the decisions and actions of ruthless politicians, and which attracts a lot of international intrigue. Friedman introduces readers to the state of play in the region in the early 1980s when Beirut was divided, Israel was waging wars against Lebanon and the PLO, and Syria was cracking down on the Sunni radicals who would gather strength decades later and challenge the government of the then President Hafez al-Assad’s son and successor, Bashar al-Assad. Many Arab authors have written about the conflict, but some of the best insights have come from fiction writers. Among them is Emily Nasrallah, who passed away in March this year. The human cost of the conflict in Lebanon and Syria is unsparingly conveyed in her short story, “What happened to Zeeko”.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:58:08 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-tale-of-two-countries/article23795247.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-tale-of-two-countries/article23795247.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:28:11.696Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

On the face of it, the whole story appears to be strange. In Syria, the civil war is complex. On the one hand, there is the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Hezbollah, Iran and Russia. On the other, a wide range of militias, from al-Qaeda and Islamic State jihadists to Free Syrian Army rebels, is fighting the regime. What has Israel got to do with a civil war between a hostile regime and a group of unpredictable dangerous militia groups?\nThe many conflicts in Syria In the initial years of the civil war, Israel’s policy choices seemed to have been driven by the same calculation. The Assad regime and Israel have never been friendly. In the 1967 war, Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria and continues to occupy the region. More than a decade later, Syria intervened in Lebanon. It then provided help to militants, mainly Hezbollah, who were resisting an Israeli occupation of the country. Syria and Israel do not have formal diplomatic ties. Despite this, there was no direct military confrontation between the two countries. In fact, despite the hostility, Israel’s border with Syria has been its calmest frontier for years. When the crisis broke in Syria in 2011, Israel was a fence sitter. It didn’t want the stable secular dictatorship in its neighbourhood to be replaced by a bunch of militants. But as the Syrian civil war evolved into a regional conflict over the years, Israel’s preferences and strategic calculations changed too.When the Syrian regime’s position got weakened in the conflict, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militant group backed by Iran, sent thousands of its soldiers to the battlefield to defend the Assad government. Iran also sent Shia militants, who were recruited from different countries, to Syria. Besides the government army, these militias fought the war on the ground on behalf of the regime. Israel was alarmed by the growing role of Hezbollah and other Iran-sponsored militias in Syria. Since the early 1980s, Hezbollah has remained a thorn in Israel’s regional strategy. In 2000, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, ending 18 years of occupation, mainly due to Hezbollah’s guerrilla resistance. In 2006, Israel bombed Lebanon again to destroy Hezbollah’s weapons infrastructure, but even after a month-long campaign, it failed to achieve its stated goals. Hezbollah has heavy military presence along southern Lebanon (or across Israel’s northern border).\nSyria stunned by Hezbollah murder: WikiLeaks\nThe Syrian war allowed Hezbollah to coordinate with its Iranian patrons directly in the battlefield. Iran has also reportedly transferred short-range missiles and other sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah via Syria. Israel responded to this through a two-pronged strategy. First, it established contact with anti-regime rebels in southern Syria, closer to the Golan. Initially Israel offered medical aid and other humanitarian assistance to the rebels, which later acquired military and logistical dimensions. The plan was to carve out a buffer between the Golan Heights that Israel controls and the Syrian Golan. Israel didn’t want Hezbollah or other Iranian proxies to take control of the border region. According to analyst Elizabeth Tsurkov, who wrote a detailed report on Israel’s activities in southern Syria, Tel Aviv now offers support to seven different rebel groups in the region, including Liwaa Forsan Jolan, Firqat Ahrar Nawa, and a section of the Free Syrian Army. Besides providing money, weapons and intelligence, Israel also supported the advances by these groups on the ground with air cover. One such incident was the Israeli bombing of regime positions in southern Syria in April 2017 after local rebel groups came under heavy attacks by regime-backed troops.The second strategy was to retain the freedom to strike Hezbollah positions inside Syria. When Russia intervened in Syria, Israel negotiated for this freedom with Moscow. Since Russia’s intervention in Syria in September 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin at least five times. Both nations developed a deconfliction mechanism that allowed Israeli planes to attack Hezbollah targets inside Syria without clashing with Russia, which is practically controlling most of the Syrian skies. This agreement worked perfectly for Israel. Last year alone, Israel said it struck suspected weapons shipments to Hezbollah around 100 times.But despite these on-and-off interventions, Israel has failed to build any substantial leverage in Syria’s conflict zones. True, it has built influence among rebel groups in southern Syria. But developments in Syria over the past two years have scuttled Israel’s strategic plans. The Israelis may have initially thought that the Russian intervention could reduce the Syrian regime’s dependence on Iran, which is Tel Aviv’s primary concern. But the Russians played on both sides. Their only strategic target was to rescue the regime. They neither stopped the Israelis from attacking Hezbollah targets inside Syria nor did they stop the Iranians from expanding their footprint in the country. Later, when the regime stabilised its rule, thanks to the Russian intervention, Iran’s influence also grew. Iran now has various military facilities across Syria’s regime-held territories.In southern Syria, Israel had built a network of rebels. But even in this area, its position has weakened over the past year. Jordan, which had offered support to the rebels in the early years of the civil war, changed its policy in the wake of heavy refugee flow. Last year, the Trump administration shut down the CIA’s military operation command in Amman that was coordinating with Syrian rebels, leaving the rebels, particularly those in the south, entirely dependent on Israel. Besides, the regime forces are making advances towards the south. They have already established some posts near Quneitra in northern Golan. Late last year, the regime regained a foothold on the de facto border with Israel by capturing Beit Jinn from the rebels. In effect, Israel not only failed to contain the spread of Iranian influence in Syria, but is also under pressure to halt the advances of regime forces towards the south.It was against this background that Israel strengthened its bombing campaign in Syria this month. Prime Minister Netanyahu has also warned Iran “not to test our resolve.” But beyond rhetoric, as the past incidents suggest, Israel’s capacity to shape reality in Syria is limited. In seven years, Iran has built a huge network in Syria and emboldened Hezbollah. This cannot be eliminated by occasional aerial raids. A full-scale intervention is risky as long as Russia directly backs the regime. And if the regime forces capture Idlib and the Damascus suburbs, which is only a matter of time, they will shift their focus to the Israel-backed rebels in the south, dragging Tel Aviv deeper into the conflict.stanly.johny@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:58:20 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-israel-factor-in-syria/article22818024.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-israel-factor-in-syria/article22818024.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:28:23.757Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

This is the second time Mr. Trump has ordered a missile attack on Syria. Last year, after a chemical attack in Idlib province, the U.S. fired 59 cruise missiles at an airbase of President Bashar al-Assad. This time, after a suspected chemical attack in Douma near Damascus, the U.K. and France joined hands with the U.S. to punish Mr. Assad’s regime. On Friday night, over 100 missiles targeted three regime facilities; with this, the Pentagon said, Syria’s chemical weapons programme has been gutted. While the use of chemical agents against civilians cannot and must not go unpunished, the manner in which the U.S. and its allies have acted raises serious questions. The U.S. undertook the strike before the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons even began its investigation in Douma to ascertain if chemical weapons had in fact been used. It should have waited till the inter-governmental watchdog completed its investigation and then presented the case for action in the UN Security Council with requisite evidence. By acting merely on the basis of inputs from their intelligence agencies, the U.S.-led alliance flouted international law.\nWhat is Trump’s Syria strategy?\nIt is also doubtful if Mr. Trump’s “mission accomplished” bravado is justified. The fact that a provocation was perceived for a second strike within a year suggests that the first one failed to deter the Assad regime. On the other hand, Mr. Trump has dragged the U.S. deeper into the Syrian civil war. If there is a future chemical attack, either by Mr. Assad or by his rivals, the U.S. will be forced to act again, perhaps more harshly. Worryingly, every time the U.S. bombs Syria, the chances of a military confrontation in the country between the U.S. and Russia heightens, given that Moscow remains firmly behind Mr. Assad. What Syrians need is not more bombs and missiles, but an end to the war, which has killed at least 400,000 people in seven years. There is no dispute that Mr. Assad is presiding over a monstrous military machine that has used brute force against his own people. But the ground reality in Syria is so complex that a sudden collapse of the regime would push the country and the millions who live in relative stability in regime-held territories into further misery. That is the last thing anyone wants. The focus of the West needs to shift from unilateral military action to aggressive multilateral diplomacy to find an immediate end to violence and then a long-lasting political solution. For that, the U.S. and Russia have to work together under a UN mandate. There is no other path to peace in Syria.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:58:32 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/war-for-war/article23550192.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/war-for-war/article23550192.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:28:35.664Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that the attacks will “stiffen our resolve, all of us, to fight back.”“If they’ve done anything they’ve encouraged us today to do even harder work to make progress and to help resolve the crises that we face,” he said.

Eastern Ghouta, with an estimated population of 400,000, is one of the last significant areas held by militants fighting the regime. It fell into the hands of the rebels in the early stages of the seven-year-long civil war, and repeated government attempts to overrun it were foiled. It was here that chemical weapons were used in 2013, killing hundreds of people. When most other rebel-held parts of Syria, including Aleppo, were recaptured by government troops, militants have moved to Eastern Ghouta and Idlib. Now both areas are under attack. In the use of heavy firepower, the assault resembles the government campaign in Aleppo and elsewhere. In Aleppo, one of Syria’s largest cities, Syrian and Russian jets pounded rebel targets in late 2016; this was followed by a ground attack by government troops and Iran-trained militants. Similarly, Eastern Ghouta, which was under a government blockade for years, appears to have been surrounded by ground forces, which could advance to rebel positions inside the city any time.\nFear and outrage over bloodshed in Syrian enclave\nThere is a wide range of militant groups in Eastern Ghouta, including the Saudi-backed Jaysh al-Islam, the Qatar-funded Faylaq al-Rahman, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda. The government says the city is occupied by terrorists from these groups and that the few civilians remaining there are used as human shields. The militants in Eastern Ghouta and the jihadist elements amongst them have repeatedly shelled government-controlled neighbourhoods in Damascus. Generally the rebels appear to have lost the momentum against Mr. Assad in the civil war. Nonetheless, the government narrative is problematic as it holds all residents of Eastern Ghouta responsible for the occupation of the area by militants. The years-long blockade of the area that has deprived Eastern Ghouta of food and medicines, and the indiscriminate bombing, killing of unarmed civilians including children, expose the monstrosity of the Assad regime. From the very beginning of the civil war, the regime and its Russian and Iranian backers have paid little attention to human suffering, be it in Hama, Homs, Aleppo or Eastern Ghouta. Given the brutality it has unleashed now, the government could capture Eastern Ghouta as well. But at what cost? After seven years of war and 400,000 deaths, Syria is a broken, bleeding land, thanks to Mr. Assad and his friends and foes. The real tragedy is that none of the parties involved is interested in ending this war.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:58:56 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fire-and-fury/article22818648.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fire-and-fury/article22818648.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:28:59.363Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

It also fights alongside between 5,000-8,000 forces from Lebanon's powerful Shia militia Hezbollah, as well as Iranian, Iraqi and Afghan fighters.Russia, a key regime backer, began an aerial campaign in support of Assad's government last September and has helped Damascus recapture areas in several provinces.Iran is another key ally, providing financial and military support.\nRebels\nOpposition factions deemed \"moderate\" are backed by the West, particularly the United States, France and the UK, though the forces have accused their supporters of providing insufficient support.Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar also back the opposition, and they have also lent support to Islamist factions.\nKurds\nSyria's Kurds are key partners of the anti-IS coalition headed by Washington, but Turkey considers the YPG to be a branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara brands a \"terror\" group.\nJihadists\nNo country openly backs the jihadists of Fateh al-Sham and IS, although the latter has been able to rely on funds from taxation and resources in the territory it holds in Syria and Iraq.\nWHO CONTROLS WHAT?\n\nRegime\nSyria's government holds around 35 percent of the country, including strategic areas such as the capital Damascus, central Homs and Hama, the coast, and large parts of Aleppo. Sixty percent of the population lives under its rule.\nIS\nDespite setbacks since 2015, IS controls around 35 percent of Syria, much of it uninhabited. It dominates Deir Ezzor province on the Iraqi border and Raqa province. It is also present in a number of other regions.\nKurds\nKurdish forces hold around 18 percent of the country, including three-quarters of the Syrian-Turkish border. They have declared a federal region in areas under their control.\nFateh al-Sham, other rebels\nFateh al-Sham and other rebel forces hold some 12 percent of the country. The largest expanse is in Idlib province and controlled by the Army of Conquest alliance.\nWHAT ARE GOALS OF EACH PARTY?\n\nRegime\nPresident Assad has said he wants to retake the whole country and will not stand down.\nRebels\nRebel forces seek to oust Mr. Assad, though factions differ on their vision for the country, with Fateh al-Sham aspiring to an Islamic emirate.\nKurds\nThe Kurds seek an autonomous region in areas where they form a majority.\nIS\nIS seeks to expand its self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" in territory under its control in Syria and Iraq.\nUnited States\nWashington has called on Mr. Assad to step down, but its efforts are now focused on combatting IS.\nRussia\nMoscow insists Mr. Assad will not be ousted, and seeks a diplomatic victory by competing with Washington to shape negotiations between the regime and rebels.\nIran\nTehran seeks to protect key ally Mr. Assad, and assert its role in the Arab world.\nTurkey\nAnkara backs the opposition, but is currently focused on preventing the Kurds from creating a contiguous autonomous region.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:59:08 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Who-is-fighting-who-in-Syria/article14593200.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/Who-is-fighting-who-in-Syria/article14593200.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:29:11.389Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

When President Vladimir Putin decided to send Russian troops to Syria in September 2015, the regime there of President Bashar al-Assad was on the brink of collapse. The Islamic State (IS) had already declared Raqqah in eastern Syria as its de facto capital. Rebels and jihadists had captured eastern Aleppo, Damascus suburbs, including Eastern Ghouta, Idlib province and southern towns like Daraa and Quneitra; they had also established a strong presence in Hama and Homs. Several rebel factions were breathing down on Damascus and the Mediterranean coastal belt, the stronghold of the regime. Three years later, Mr. Assad is safe, while his regime has recaptured most of the territories it lost in the early days of the war.Both Russia and Iran have played a crucial role in this turnaround. Though Russian air power was the most critical factor, especially in the battles for Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta, the Iran-trained militias, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah, fought alongside the Syrian army on the ground against the rebels and jihadists. But even when they were partnering in the war against common enemies, the Russians and Iranians had different goals in Syria. For Mr. Putin, the Syrian intervention was a big gamble. He sensed that the Obama administration was indecisive despite its threats against the Assad regime and that the rebels were divided. His immediate plan was to salvage the regime, bolster Russia’s position in West Asia (Syria hosts a Russian naval base at Tartus) and send a message to his rivals in the West.With the survival of the regime, Mr. Putin has achieved his immediate goal. But in the long run, he doesn’t want Russia to get stuck in Syria, like the Soviet Union or the U.S. later got caught up in Afghanistan. Therefore, Moscow is continuously pressing the Assad regime to be ready for a lasting political solution to the crisis.Iran, on the other side, does not want any radical change in the current composition of the regime. Its immediate goal, like that of the Russians, was the survival of the regime. This was the common ground that brought both countries together in Syria. If Russia wanted to protect its naval base and expand its influence in West Asia through Syria, Iran does not want to lose its only ally in the region and a vital link with the Hezbollah. But in the long run, Iran wants to build permanent bases in Syria, stretching its military influence from Tehran through Baghdad and Damascus to southern Lebanon. Both Lebanon and Syria share borders with Israel. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has already established a strong military presence along Israel’s northern border. Iran’s plan was to apply strategic pressure on Israel by building more military infrastructure and deploying Shia militias closer towards the Israeli-occupied territories of Syria.When the war was on in full swing, these apparent differences were played down. The Russians and Iranians fought together alongside Syrian troops. But after Mr. Assad stabilised his rule over most of Syria’s population centres (rebel/jihadist factions now control Idlib province and Daraa and Quneitra, while the Kurdish rebels have established autonomous rule in the northwest), the cracks in the pro-Assad coalition began to emerge.With the war winding down, Russia may now now be feeling less reliant on Iran, and Tehran is growing wary of Moscow’s game plans. From the early days of the Russian intervention, Mr. Putin has been specific on not widening the scope of the war. There were several attempts aimed at provoking Russia which could have escalated the conflict. In November 2015, a Russian warplane was shot down by Turkey. Russia’s response was a rather tame one, of economic sanctions. The U.S. bombed Mr. Assad’s forces twice since Donald Trump became U.S. President. On both occasions, Mr. Putin overlooked the provocation. He did the same when Israel targeted Hezbollah positions within Syria.But the crisis escalated despite Mr. Putin’s stance when Israel started directly attacking Iranian positions within Syria. In February, after Israel claimed an Iranian drone entered its air space, it carried out a massive bombing campaign in Syria against Iran. In May, immediately after Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the multilateral Iran nuclear deal, Israel launched another major attack against Iranian targets. Interestingly, when the attack was under way, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Moscow. He watched Russia’s Victory Day parade in Red Square marking the Soviet victory in the Second World War against Hitler’s Germany. Israeli officials later told their Russian counterparts, “Israel will continue to maintain its operational freedom to act against Iranian entrenchment in all of Syria.”Russia practically controls Syria’s airspace. But it has entered into deconfliction mechanisms with the U.S. and Israel so that the three countries can carry out air strikes without hurting each other. While the U.S. has mostly carried out strikes against the IS, Israel has used Syrian air space only to attack Iran and Hezbollah, both of which are Russia’s partners in the civil war. Yet, Mr. Putin hasn’t done anything to defend his allies. He has also become more receptive to Turkey expanding its role in Syria. The increasing crack in the Russia-Iran axis was again on display when in May Mr. Putin called for all foreign troops to leave Syria once the war is over. Later Russia’s Ambassador in Damascus clarified that the troops which Mr. Putin referred to include Iran’s. Iran’s Foreign Ministry was quick to respond, saying that it would remain in Syria “as long as the Syrian government wants Iran to help it”.Mr. Putin is likely conscious of Iran’s vulnerability. Tehran does not have many allies. And after Mr. Trump threw a spanner into the Iran nuclear deal, it also faces the return of biting sanctions. It cannot afford to antagonise the Russians, certainly not at a time when the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel are teaming up to contain its influence. This Persian vulnerability allows Mr. Putin to maintain a delicate balancing act in a highly complex war theatre. For how long is now the question. Russia’s tame responses to repeated aggression in Syria by other powers have already cast a shadow on its Syria strategy. Mr. Putin may be balancing his relations with several players for now to avoid a conflagration. But Israel and Turkey are not Russia’s traditional allies. In West Asia, Israel is the strongest ally of the U.S., which remains Russia’s most powerful geopolitical rival. And Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, an overhang of the Cold War, aimed at checking the West-ward creep of Russia’s influence. In contrast, Tehran is Moscow’s ally and partner, but Russia either doesn’t want to or is not in a position to defend Iran’s interests in Syria.This is the dilemma that confronts Mr. Putin: how he can restore Russia’s lost glory in the new Cold War if he cannot even defend the interests of his partners in a country (Syria) where he appears to be in control.stanly.johny@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:55:51 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/russian-games-in-syria/article24146944.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/russian-games-in-syria/article24146944.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:29:22.456Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Swathes of territory on the Syrian-Turkish border, mostly populated by the Kurds, are now controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-Arab militia that was in the forefront of the land war against the IS. With the planned 30,000-strong border force, which will mostly draw fighters from the SDF, the U.S. is not only institutionalising the militia, but also setting the stage for a prolonged stay in Syria. From the outset of the Syrian civil war, the U.S. has been on the losing side. The Obama administration had called for the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad and was supporting anti-Assad rebels as well as running a clandestine CIA-run programme to unseat him. But the 2015 Russian intervention in Syria sabotaged those plans and helped Mr. Assad consolidate power and recapture most of the territory lost to rebels and jihadists. Then the U.S. shifted its focus to defeating the IS and establishing its influence in the country. In that bid, Kurds, who were facing IS advances, proved helpful. At present, the country is divided into three major camps. Most cities and population centres, including the Mediterranean coast, are controlled by the regime, while rebels and al-Qaeda-linked jihadists run Idlib province (which is now under attack by regime-Russian forces). In northeastern Syria, Kurds have carved out a semi-autonomous region. It’s here that the U.S. is cultivating its proxies. The U.S.’s plan is to carve out a sphere of influence in the middle of West Asia’s most dangerous conflict and have it guarded by the battle-hardened Kurdish forces. This enclave could help the U.S. in designing future plans in the region. But the move carries great risks. First, Turkey, an American ally and a NATO member, is already angry. Turkey, which fights a Kurdish militancy on its soil, sees any further empowerment of the Syrian Kurds as an immediate threat to security, and has vowed to fight the new “terrorist” army. If Ankara attacks the border force, that would raise tensions between the U.S. and Turkey further. Second, throughout the civil war, the Syrian regime and the Kurds maintained a complex relationship. They were hostile to each other, but never fought against each other, barring some isolated incidents. Syrian Kurds, unlike their Iraqi counterparts, do not demand independence. Rather, they emphasise on autonomy and a federated post-war state structure. These are the issues that should be discussed as part of any final settlement between the regime and the Kurds. But the latest U.S. plans pre-empt any such future deal. This will keep Syria divided forever, leaving the Kurds fully dependent on U.S. aid in the wake of increased regional tensions, while the U.S. gets another foothold for its West Asian geopolitical manoeuvring.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 18, 2018 12:59:31 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/long-game-in-syria/article22458054.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/long-game-in-syria/article22458054.ece","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:29:33.836Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The first target was a scientific research center located in the Greater Damascus area. “This military facility was a Syrian Center for the research development, production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology,” he said, adding that the second target was a chemical weapons storage facility. We assessed that this was the primary location of Syrian sarin and precursor production equipment. The third target, which was in the vicinity of the second target, contain both the chemical weapons equipment storage facility and an important command post,” he said.Dunford said that the nw strikes were qualitatively and quantitatively different than the one conducted in 2017. Last year, the US conducted a unilateral strike on a single site. The focus was on the aircraft associated with the Syrian chemical weapons attack in April of 2017. “This evening, we conducted strikes with two allies on multiple sites that will result in a long-term degradation of Syrians capability to research, develop and employee, chemical and biological weapons. Important infrastructure was destroyed which will result in a setback for the Syrian regime,” he said.“They will lose years of research and development data, specialized equipment, and expensive chemical weapons precursors. The strike was not only a strong message to the regime that their actions were inexcusable, but it also inflicted maximum damage without unnecessary risk to innocent civilians,” Dunford said.Responding to questions, Mattis said that “right now this is a one-time shot” and it sent a very strong message to Assad. “We did have some initial surface to air missile activity from the Syrian regime. That is the only retaliatory action that we’re aware of at this time,” Dunford said, adding that the nature of the operation and targets that were assigned to the United States Central Command have been completed.The United States, France and Britain, Dunford said, “did not do any coordination” with the Russians on the strikes, nor did they were pre-notified by the US. “The only communications that took place specifically (with Russians) with this operation before the targets were struck was the normal deconfliction of the airspace, the procedures that are in place for all of our operations in Syria,” he said .US Vice President Mike Pence, who is currently travelling to Lime in Peru to attend the Summit of the Americas, abruptly left its opening ceremony to notify the Congressional leadership of the air strikes in Syria.Pence spoke to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, his spokesperson Jarrod Agen told reporters travelling with him.

The staggering death toll – at least 68 civilians – killed came a day after Syria passed the seven-year mark in its relentless civil war.In Damascus’ rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta, Syrian and Russian jets struck the town of Kafr Batna with cluster bombs, napalm-like incendiary weapons, and conventional explosives, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The assault was part of an indiscriminate campaign by President Bashar Assad’s forces to retake the town and the rest of the enclave from the rebels.A medical charity supporting hospitals in the Ghouta region, the Syrian American Medical Society, said doctors in Kafr Batna were treating patients for severe burn wounds. The charity said it recorded 40 casualties on Friday. The Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group said it identified 42 bodies so far. Oways al-Shami, a spokesman for Syrian Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, said he expected the toll to rise further. “Most of the (bodies) were charred,” he was quoted as saying by AP.Exhausted and shell-shocked civilians streamed out of eastern Ghouta for the second consecutive day to buses arranged by the government to take them to a center for identification and relief. A man interviewed on state-affiliated al-Ikhbariya TV said he had gone two days without food. Others said rebels hoarded food and humiliated civilians, even shooting people trying to leave. The UN has warned of a malnutrition crisis in eastern Ghouta, which human rights groups have blamed on the government’s strangling blockade.Russia’s Defence Ministry said close to 5,000 civilians have been evacuated today, after more than 10,000 left the enclave the before. The assault on eastern Ghouta has devastated towns across the region and damaged and destroyed over a dozen hospitals. At least 1,300 civilians have been killed under shelling and airstrikes. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian military and the Syrian government would extend a “cease-fire” in Damascus’ rebel-held suburbs as long as it takes to allow all the civilians to leave the area.In northern Syria, where Kurdish officials Turkish shelling and airstrikes killed at least 22 civilians on Friday in the town of Afrin, the Turkish military urged civilians to leave and the Syrian Kurdish militiamen to surrender to besieging Turkish forces. The media office for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led and US-backed force that operates in the Kurdish autonomous region in the north, said also that at least 30 were wounded in Friday’s attacks. Victims lay dead the streets in pools of blood, according to a video from the Observatory, which monitors Syria’s seven-year civil war and which put the death toll at 18. Different casualty tolls are common in the immediate aftermath of big attacks.Since their January offensive began, Turkish forces have nearly encircled Afrin in an effort to drive the Syrian Kurdish fighters from the town and the surrounding region. Residents say they are facing bread, water, and electricity shortages. The Observatory and activists reported seeing hundreds of civilians filing out of Afrin to neighboring villages on Thursday and Friday, looking for relief. Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to still be inside. Earlier, Turkish aircraft dropped flyers in Arabic and Kurdish on Afrin, asking residents to stay away from “terrorist positions” a reference to the Syrian Kurdish fighters and to not let themselves be used as “human shields.”The leaflets claimed that civilians desiring to flee Afrin would be guaranteed safety by the Turkish military and urged Syrian Kurdish fighters to “trust the hand we extend to you.” “Come surrender! A calm and peaceful future awaits you in Afrin,” the leaflets read. Thursday saw the largest single-day exodus of civilians in Syria’s civil war. The government offensive has pushed further into eastern Ghouta, chipping away at one of the largest and most significant opposition bastions since the early days of the rebellion communities where some 400,000 people are estimated to be holed up.Since mid-February, Syrian troops have targeted Damascus’ sprawling suburbs with shells, airstrikes and, at times, even toxic gas, according to opposition medics. They are now in control of the majority of the enclave that had been in rebel hands since 2012.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/syria-attacks-people-flee-killings-damascus-ghouta-5100460/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:30:30.645Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77cb2b4719c85521657349"},"header":"From George Bush to Donald Trump: How US policy towards Syria has evolved","time":"\nSaturday, August 18, 2018\n\n","content":"Express Audio: Veteran journalist Coomi Kapoor on media freedom and how it has changed over the yearsIn a move significantly departing from his earlier stance on Syria, US president Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian airbase on Friday, in response to a deadly chemical attack suspected to have been launched by the Bashar al-Assad led government a day back.The ongoing civil war in Syria has come a long way since it took roots in 2011 and has, at different phases called for varying set of foreign policies, not just towards the concerned country, but rather the entire Middle East. The civil war in Syria has had far reaching implications throughout the world, in the form of a drastic immigration crisis, the establishment of radical terrorist organisations in the Middle East and the fear of humanitarian violence that spread across the globe.The multiple pronged struggle currently going on in Syria, with the Assad regime on one end, the rebels at another and the radical Islamist forces at yet another end, has been at the receiving end of the wrath and sympathy from almost all of the global powers depending to a large extent upon the political benefits that each could derive from the region. American policy towards the Syrian trouble has been particularly significant, for several reasons foremost being the hegemonic influence the country has tried to maintain in the Arab region for decades now, to the extent that the current crisis in the continent is seen as being almost a byproduct of American aggression.But Trump’s decision to attack the Syrian base today can hardly be seen in tune with the overall structure of foreign policy maintained by America towards the country. Trump had fervently decided to not make humanitarian interventions in the US, but rather focus on uprooting Islamic terror groups for the sake of avoiding terror attacks on American soil. However, the recent act of aggression seems a volte face, as reports mention his change of stance being a response to the kind of deplorable suffering of the victims of the chemical attack. For that matter, America’s response to Syria, particularly under the administration of the last two presidents have seen significant shifts over time, depending on the political necessities of the moment. In order to understand what Trump’s sudden change of heart could mean, we reflect upon the evolution of American policy towards Syria since the governance of George W Bush.George BushAnalysing the Bush government’s policy towards Syria, political scientist Jülide Karakoç calls it a case of “indirect orientalism”, by which she means that the US maintained favourable positions against certain players in the Middle East- Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia- so as to impose a position of power upon the rest of the Arab region. Accordingly, while Israel was held up as a model of western values, Syria was seen as a backward and radical power. The most important document supporting this attitude was the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act (SALSRA), that imposed several sanctions upon Syria so as to halt the sponsor of terrorism and giving up on weapons of mass destruction, apart from asking the country to hold unconditional negotiations with Israel.The most radical step towards a Syrian policy came in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks when the US launched a ‘war on terror’, categorising certain states of the Middle East, including Syria and Iraq as ‘rogue states’ that sponsored terrorism. The Bush policy towards Syria was to isolate it from its neighbours. When under his administration, America invaded Iraq in 2003, it left behind a country caught in sectarian bloodshed and ripe for the growth of radical Islamic organisations that would go on to be the creators of some of the biggest cases of havoc in the region.Barack ObamaAmerican invasion of Iraq in 2003 had resulted in the government being met with severe criticism, both from internal and external players. When Barack Obama took over the administration in 2008, he had before him the popular demand to end the aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan. For the ordinary American the wars had cost them their tax money and the lives of the soldiers.Thereafter when the Syrian crisis began in 2011, while the American president understood the humanitarian necessities to intervene, he remained firmly resolved to not respond with military aggression. He was aware of the economic and human costs that the war would entail. His decision was further backed by the United Kingdom and Germany.However, in 2012 Obama made a strong remark when he warned the Assad administration of a change in American policy if he crossed the ‘red line’ by using chemical or biological weapons. Soon after, the Assad regime did infact engage in a chemical attack, resulting in America contemplating a response involving military powers. However, on being advised against such a move by the Congress, Obama refrained from going down that road.However, in 2014, the former president did in fact decide to intervene in Syria, but not against the Assad regime, rather to uproot the radical Islamic rebel group, ISIS. The change in position came after the public release of two videos depicting the beheading of American journalists by ISIS agents. The following three years America continued with its war against the organisation in Iraq and Syria through bombings from aircrafts and missiles fired from warships. While Obama has, right from the beginning been against the Assad regime and supported the rebel forces, when he did decide to intervene in the Middle Eastern state, it was a means to end the calamity caused by a radical rebel group. His decision was seen as a response to humanitarian necessities and a way to keep away terrorism from American shores. Nonetheless, post his presidential tenure, Obama has consistently been on the receiving end of criticism for being unable to sort out the situation in Syria.Donald TrumpWhen the Obama administration attacked Syria in 2013, Donald Trump tweeted out a sharp criticism against the move. “”What I am saying is stay out of Syria. The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix USA,” said Trump back in 2013.When he took over the role of the American president he was firmly resolved not to intervene against the Assad regime on humanitarian grounds. His position was also affected by the fact that Russia, who Trump favours, has been in support of the Assad regime.If at all Trump would intervene in Syria, he maintained it would be against the ISIS for the sake of protecting America from terrorist activities. However, when the chemical strikes did take place in Syria a day back, he was quick to criticise the Obama administration for being weak and irresolute in their response to Assad. “President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a ‘red line’ against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing,” said Trump. Soon after he launched the missile strike on Syria, marking a huge drift from his initial foreign policy. As per his address to the nation, his decision to attack the Syrian air base comes in response to the huge humanitarian crisis created by Assad there. “Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians. Assad choked out the lives of helpless men women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many, even beautiful babies. No child of god should ever suffer so much,” said Trump.Interestingly, however, reports suggest that Russia was intimated about the attack beforehand, suggesting Trump’s efforts at maintaining relations with the East European power who has been favourable towards Assad. The shift in Trump’s policy, keeping Russia by its side is a major development in global policy towards the Assad regime. What it means for Syrian civilians, rebel groups and the government in future, only time will tell.\n\u003cimg width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/02/adrija-roy.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003eAdrija RoychowdhuryAdrija is senior sub-editor, Indian Express.

There are red lines, and the censorship that was there before 2011 is still there today,” said Omar Abu Saada, one of the country’s best-known theatre directors.The play – called “While I Was Waiting” – is based on the real-life story of a young man found beaten unconscious near a hospital in Damascus in 2013, but the circumstances of his beating and subsequent death remained unclear. Abu Saada knew the man and his family.“When I thought about working on a new project, this was the story that came to my mind. It pretty much imposed itself,” he said.In the play, the man oscillates between life and death and the lack of answers unnerves his family. His suspended state is a metaphor for the state of waiting that all Syrians share, whether inside the country or abroad and regardless of their political views, the director said. Another thing all Syrians share is loss, he added.The Syrian conflict, which began with a popular uprising against the state, has raged on into its seventh year. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half of Syrians homeless, and created the world’s worst refugee crisis.“Syrians today are not in a single place, they are suspended. Waiting is something that we all have in common,” Abu Saada said. “Most people lost someone close, either by death, emigration or imprisonment. Everyone lost something.”This has changed the way Syrians think, their social fabric and even they way they make art, he said. The play charts the disenchantment of young Taym, the comatose patient, from his hope for change at the start of the 2011 uprising to his despair as it spiralled into a war.Syria’s young generation, active in organising and documenting the mass protests, lost the most in the violent turn of events, he said. “The state of coma is more of a metaphor for the lack of power to change things,” Abu Saada said.The play made its debut in Brussels in 2016 and has since been staged in France, the United States and Japan among other places. The six cast members said they could not meet anywhere in the Arab world for rehearsals because of visa restrictions.“So in the end, we rehearsed in France which under normal circumstances would have been the harder place to go to,” said Nanda Mohamed, a Syrian actress.The writer, who has previously lived in Lebanon, had to leave Beirut in 2015 when the Lebanese government imposed stricter conditions on Syrians in the country. But he said being forced to leave Lebanon helped him view the war differently.“Sometimes the geographical distance helps create the gap for critical thinking and I tried to take advantage of that,” said Mohamed al-Attar, 38.“What happened to us was tragic but what would be more tragic is if we couldn’t review things. It would be disastrous if after the heavy price we paid and we continue to pay that we also do not have the courage to think about what we lost and boldly criticize it,” Attar said.Attar previously worked in Beirut with director Abu Saada on an adaptation of the Greek myth Antigone performed by an all-female cast of Syrian refugees. Both agree the play is about fuelling debate about a war that is not yet over.“The idea of creating a play about something that you are living in the middle of and still being affected by and probably have not yet processed is difficult,” Abu Saada said. “But I know that there is no running away from it.”","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/in-beirut-a-play-about-syrias-war-gets-as-close-to-home-as-it-can-4901303/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:31:15.335Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The latest round of talks begins days after the Islamic State jihadist group was forced out of its de facto capital Raqa in northern Syria, in a major victory for the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces.Recent rounds of talks in the Central Asian nation have focused on ironing out the details of a Russia-led plan for four de-escalation zones in Syria. “Closed-format talks have begun,” Kazakh foreign ministry spokesman Anuar Zhainakov told AFP, adding that the two-day negotiations would conclude with statements to the press.Zhainakov confirmed that delegations from the Syrian government and the rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad’s overthrow had arrived in Astana, as had negotiators from Turkey and regime backers Russia and Iran. Despite backing opposite sides in the war, Ankara and Moscow have been working closely on Syria since a 2016 reconciliation ended a crisis caused by the shooting down of a Russian war plane.A de-escalation zones plan was first tabled in Astana in May to minimise fighting between government forces and moderate rebel factions, as well as improve access for aid for civilians living in the zones. But international organisations painted the humanitarian situation in Eastern Ghouta — covered by the zones deal and located just outside the capital Damascus — in dire terms earlier this month.UNICEF says over a thousand children in the area are suffering from severe, acute or moderately acute malnutrition, with over 1,500 more at serious risk, as aid convoys have failed to reach needy populations. While the de-escalation zones brought about an initial\nreduction in fighting, the International Red Cross has voiced concern that the violence has intensified again, including in the zones. Previous rounds of Astana negotiations have ended without major breakthroughs, but they have made more progress than the parallel UN-driven talks on Syria in Geneva.The last round of talks in September saw Russia, Turkey and Iran agree to jointly police a buffer zone in the contentious northern province of Idlib, where Ankara and Tehran are viewed as having competing interests. Zones covering part of the south of the country, Eastern Ghouta, and the central province of Homs had already been agreed during a previous round of talks. Russian military police were then deployed to secure the areas. Syria’s United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura urged parties to move on from the zones towards “a more stable political settlement” during a mid-October visit to Moscow.The next round of Geneva talks will begin on November 28, De Mistura has said. Russia’s military intervention two years ago in the Syrian war that has claimed more than 330,000 lives to date turned the tables in Assad’s favour. But rebels still insist on Assad’s removal from power as a principal term for any peace deal.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/fresh-syria-talks-open-in-astana-4914332/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:31:45.254Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Big price to pay.\"Trump's anger and apparent determination was quickly matched by France's President Emmanuel Macron, who signed his country up for a joint response.(Photo: Twitter | AFP)Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May was more cautious, but by the time the first precision cruise missile was launched, Trump had a mini-coalition.May said there was \"no practicable alternative\" to the use of force against Assad.Trump's language was more brutal: \"They are crimes of a monster.\"'Proof' In the six days between the attack and the US-led response, Washington and Moscow clashed repeatedly in duelling press statements and US debates.Moscow denied its ally Assad had any role in the outrage, pushing a variety of alternative theories that peaked with a claim that Britain had staged the event.More practically, at the United Nations, Russia's diplomats vetoed a US motion to re-establish an international investigation into chemical weapons use in Syria that could have established blame.Washington, Paris and London have nevertheless insisted that their own secret intelligence points to Assad's guilt, and on Friday, a US spokeswoman said they had \"proof.\"The western leaders apparently found this convincing enough reason to launch a punitive strike, but other observers are concerned that the crisis could escalate.The Russian military had vowed to respond to any attack, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration had repeatedly warned that Trump was taking America down a dangerous path.That concern was mirrored by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who on Friday warned the rival camps against \"full-blown military escalation.\"\"Let us not forget that, ultimately, our efforts must be about ending the terrible suffering of the Syrian people,\" he urged the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.And he stressed the need \"the need to avoid the situation spiraling out of control.\"Decision to actBut Trump has long criticized his predecessor Barack Obama for failing to enforce a previous US \"red line\" in 2013 after earlier chemical attacks blamed on Assad's forces.And he set his own precedent just over a year ago when he ordered a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base after sarin was fired at civilians in the town of Khan Sheikhun.  Backed by his hawkish new national security adviser John Bolton, who took office on Monday, Trump has been meeting with advisors and generals all week to plan.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has reportedly been arguing for a cautious response that would minimize the risk of the US being dragged deeper into Syria's civil war. But other advisors want to use the opportunity to convince Trump, who wants to pull US forces out of Syria once the Islamic State jihadist group is defeated, to take a tough stance.These hardliners, along with influential US allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, want Washington to counter Iran's growing power in Syria -- even if it means risking a perilous stand-off with Russia.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/america/140418/to-teach-bashar-al-assad-a-lesson-us-uk-france-launch-military-st.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:32:21.887Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Damascus's denial comes as a growing number of countries including the European Union, the United States and Canada have cast doubt on whether the Syrian regime is truly making efforts to destroy its lethal arms.There are \"many uncertainties regarding the dismantling of Syria's chemical weapons programme, notably the gaps and contradictions contained in Syria's declarations,\" EU representative Jacek Bylica told the meeting, attended by delegates from the OPCW's 192 states.\"These uncertainties lead to doubts as to compliance by Syria with its obligations under the Convention,\" Bylica said at the opening of the five-day assembly in The Hague.This \"makes it impossible to have confidence that its chemical weapons programme has been irreversibly dismantled,\" Bylica said.Last week the OPCW itself voiced \"grave concern\" at the continued use of toxic arms in Syria.

Any minute the boss will come and we'll get into trouble.\"You too,\" he warned.The chartered Airbus A320 waiting on the tarmac for them had just flown in from the Syrian capital, Damascus, disgorging about 30 men with tanned faces into the largely deserted arrivals area. Most were in camouflage gear and khaki desert boots. Some were toting bags from the Damascus airport duty-free.The men were private Russian military contractors, the latest human cargo in a secretive airlift using civilian planes to ferry military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his six-year fight against rebels, a Reuters investigation of the logistical network behind Assad's forces has uncovered.The Airbus they flew on was just one of dozens of aircraft that once belonged to mainstream European and U.S. aviation companies, then were passed through a web of intermediary companies and offshore firms to Middle Eastern airlines subject to U.S. sanctions - moves that Washington alleges are helping Syria bypass the sanctions.The flights in and out of Rostov, which no organisation has previously documented, are operated by Cham Wings, a Syrian airline hit with US sanctions in 2016 for allegedly transporting pro-Assad fighters to Syria and helping Syrian military intelligence transport weapons and equipment.The flights, which almost always land late at night, don't appear in any airport or airline timetables, and fly in from either Damascus or Latakia, a Syrian city where Russia has a military base.The operation lays bare the gaps in the US sanctions, which are designed to starve Assad and his allies in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Hezbollah militia of the men and materiel they need to wage their military campaign.It also provides a glimpse of the methods used to send private Russian military contractors to Syria - a deployment the Kremlin insists does not exist. Russian officials say Moscow's presence is limited to air strikes, training of Syrian forces and small numbers of special forces troops.Reuters reporters staked out the Rostov airport, logged the unusual flights using publicly available flight-tracking data, searched aircraft ownership registries and conducted dozens of interviews, including a meeting at a fashionable restaurant with a former Soviet marine major on a US government blacklist.Asked about the flights and the activities of Russian private military contractors in Syria, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin referred Reuters to the Defence Ministry - which didn't reply to the questions.The Syrian government also didn't reply to questions.In response to detailed Reuters questions, Cham Wings said only that information on where it flies was available on its website.The flights to Rostov aren't mentioned on the site. But the journeys do appear in online flight-tracking databases. Reporters traced flights between the Rostov airport and Syria from Jan 5, 2017, to March 11, 2018. In that time, Cham Wings aircraft made 51 round trips, each time using Airbus A320 jets that can carry up to 180 passengers.The issue of military casualties is highly sensitive in Russia, where memories linger of operations in Chechnya and Afghanistan that dragged on for years. Friends and relatives of the contractors suspect Moscow is using the private fighters in Syria because that way it can put more boots on the ground without risking regular soldiers, whose deaths have to be accounted for.Forty-four regular Russian service personnel have died in Syria since the start of the operation there in September 2015, Russian authorities have said. This number does not include 39 Russian service personnel who died in a non-combat plane crash in Latakia on March 6. A Reuters tally based on accounts from families and friends of the dead and local officials suggests that at least 40 contractors were killed between January and August 2017 alone.One contractor killed in Syria left Russia on a date that tallies with one of the mysterious nighttime flights out of Rostov, his widow said. The death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus gave his cause of death as\"haemorrhagic shock from shrapnel and bullet wounds.\"To sustain his military campaign against rebels, Assad and his allies in Russia, Iran and the Hezbollah militia need access to civilian aircraft to fly in men and supplies. Washington has tried to choke off access to the aircraft and their parts through export restrictions on Syria and Iran and through Treasury Department sanctions blacklisting airlines in those countries.The Treasury Department has also blacklisted several companies outside Syria, accusing them of acting as middlemen.\"These actions demonstrate our resolve to target anyone who is enabling Assad and his regime,\" John E. Smith, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in testimony to a congressional committee in November.In recent years, dozens of planes have been registered in Ukraine to two firms, Khors and Dart, that were founded by a former Soviet marine major and his onetime military comrades, according to the Ukraine national aircraft register. The planes were then sold or leased and ended up being operated by Iranian and Syrian airlines, according to the flight-tracking data.One of the companies, Khors, and the former marine major, Sergei Tomchani, have been on a US Commerce Department blacklist since 2011 for allegedly exporting aircraft to Iran and Syria without obtaining licences from Washington.But in the past seven years, Khors and Dart have managed to acquire or lease 84 second-hand Airbus and Boeing aircraft by passing the aircraft through layers of non-sanctioned entities, according to information collated by Reuters from national aircraft registers.Of these 84 aircraft, at least 40 have since been used in Iran, Syria and Iraq, according to data from three flight-tracking websites, which show the routes aircraft fly and give the call sign of the company operating them.In September, the US Treasury Department added Khors and Dart to its sanctions blacklist, saying they were helping sanctioned airlines procure US-made aircraft. Khors and Dart, as well as Tomchani, have denied any wrongdoing related to supplying planes to sanctioned entities.The ownership histories of some of the aircraft tracked by Reuters showed how the US restrictions on supplies to Iranian and Syrian airlines may be skirted. As the ownership skips from one country to the next, the complex paper trail masks the identity of those involved in Syria's procurement of the planes.One of the Cham Wings Airbus A320 jets that has made the Rostov-Syria trip was, according to the Irish aircraft register, once owned by ILFC Ireland Limited, a subsidiary of Dublin-based AerCap, one of the world's biggest aircraft-leasing firms.In January 2015, the aircraft was removed from the Irish register, said a spokesman for the Irish Aviation Authority, which administers the register. For the next two months, the aircraft, which carried the identification number EI-DXY, vanished from national registers before showing up on the aircraft register in Ukraine.The Ukrainian register gave its new owner as Gresham Marketing Ltd, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. The owners of the company are two Ukrainians, Viktor Romanika and Nikolai Saverchenko, according to corporate documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. Ukrainian business records show they are managers in small local businesses.Contacted by phone, Romanika said he knew nothing and hung up. Saverchenko couldn't be reached by phone and didn't respond to a letter delivered to the address listed for him.In March 2015, Gresham leased EI-DXY to Dart, according to the Ukrainian aircraft register. The identification number was changed to a Ukrainian number, UR-CNU. On Aug 20, 2015, Khors became the aircraft's operator, the register showed.A representative of the Ukraine State Aviation Service said the register was not intended as official confirmation of ownership but that there had been no complaints about the accuracy of its information.From April that year, the aircraft was flown by Cham Wings, according to data from the flight-tracking websites.Gillian Culhane, a spokeswoman for AerCap, the firm whose subsidiary owned the plane in 2015, didn't respond to written questions or answer repeated phone calls seeking comment about what AerCap knew about the subsequent owners and operators of the plane. Dart and Khors didn't respond to questions about the specific aircraft.Four lawyers specialising in US export rules say that transactions involving aircraft that end up in Iran or Syria carry significant risks for Western companies supplying the planes or equipment. Even if they had no direct dealings with a sanctioned entity, the companies supplying the aircraft can face penalties or restrictions imposed by the US government, the lawyers said.The lawyers, however, said that the legal exposure for aircraft makers such as Boeing and Airbus was minimal, because the trade involves second-hand aircraft that are generally more than 20 years old, and the planes had been through a long chain of owners before ending up with operators subject to sanctions.Two of the lawyers, including Edward J. Krauland, who leads the international regulation and compliance group at law firm Steptoe \u0026 Johnson, said US export rules apply explicitly to Boeing aircraft because they're made in the United States. But they can also apply to Airbus jets because, in many cases, a substantial percentage of the components is of US origin.Boeing said in a statement: \"The aircraft transactions described that are the subject of your inquiry did not involve The Boeing Company. Boeing maintains a robust overall trade control and sanctions compliance program.\"An Airbus spokesman said, \"Airbus fully respects all applicable legal requirements with regard to transactions with countries under UN, EU, UK and US sanctions.\"When Reuters sent a series of questions to Khors and Dart about their activities, Tomchani, the former marine major, called the reporter within minutes.He said he was no longer a shareholder in either firm but was acting as a consultant to them, and that the questions had been passed on to him. He invited the reporter to meet the following day at the high-end Velyur restaurant in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.In the 90-minute meeting, he denied providing aircraft to Iran or Syria. Instead, he said, Khors and Dart had provided aircraft to third parties, which he did not identify. Those third parties, he said, supplied the planes on to the end users.\"We did not supply aircraft to Iran,\" Tomchani, a man of military bearing in his late 50s, said as he sipped herbal tea.\"We have nothing to do with supplying aircraft to Cham Wings.\"Neither Dart nor Khors could have sold or leased aircraft to Cham Wings because they were not the owners of the aircraft, he said.Tomchani used to serve in a marine unit of the Soviet armed forces in Vladivostok, on Russia's Pacific coast. In 1991, after quitting the military with the rank of major, he set up Khors along with two other officers in his unit. Tomchani and his partners made a living by flying Soviet-built aircraft, sold off cheap after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in war zones.Khors flew cargoes in Angola for the Angolan government and Defence Ministry and aid agencies during its civil war. Tomchani said his companies also operated flights in Iraq after the US-led invasion in 2003, transporting private security contractors.Ukraine's register of business ownership showed that Tomchani ceased to be a shareholder in Khors after June 2010 and that he gave up his interest in Dart at some point after April 2011. He told Reuters he sold his stakes to \"major businessmen\",but declined to name them.He did say, however, that the people listed at the time of the interview in Ukraine's business register as the owners of the two companies were merely proxies. One of the owners in the register was a mid-ranking Khors executive, one was an 81-year-old accountant for several Kiev firms, and another was someone with the same name and address as a librarian from Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.According to the business register, the owner of 25 per cent in Khors is someone called Vladimir Suchkov. The address listed for him in the register is No. 33, Elektrikov Street, Kiev. That's the same address as the one listed in Ukrainian government procurement documents for military unit No. A0515, which comes under the command of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate.Tomchani said he and Suchkov were old acquaintances. \"He wasn't a bad specialist,\" Tomchani said. \"A young lad, but not bad.\"He said he believed Suchkov was living in Russia.Reuters was unable to contact Suchkov. A telephone number listed for him was out of service. The Ukrainian Intelligence Directorate's acting head, Alexei Bakumenko, told Reuters that Suchkov doesn't work there.Reuters found no evidence of any other link between the trade in aircraft and Ukraine's broader spy apparatus. Ukrainian military intelligence said it has no knowledge of the supply of aircraft to Syria, has no connection to the transport of military contractors from Russia to Syria, and hasn't cooperated with Khors, Dart or Cham Wings.On Jan 9 this year, Dart changed its name to Alanna, and listed a new address and founders, according to the Ukrainian business register. On March 1, a new company, Alanna Air, took over Alanna's assets and liabilities, the register showed. Although Moscow denies it is sending private military contractors to Syria, plenty of people say that's untrue. Among them are dozens of friends and former colleagues of the fighters and people associated with the firm that recruits the men - a shadowy organisation known as Wagner with no offices, not even a brass plaque on a door.It was founded by Dmitry Utkin, a former military intelligence officer, according to people interviewed during this investigation. Its first combat role was in eastern Ukraine in support of Moscow-backed separatists, they said. Reuters was unable to contact Utkin directly.The League of Veterans of Local Conflicts, which according to Russian media has ties to Utkin, declined to pass on a message to him, saying it had no connection to the Wagner group.Russia has 2,000 to 3,000 contractors fighting in Syria, said Yevgeny Shabayev, local leader of a paramilitary organisation in Russia who is in touch with some of the men. In a single battle in February this year, about 300 contractors were either killed or wounded, according to a military doctor and two other sources familiar with the matter.A Russian private military contractor who has been on four missions to Syria said he arrived there on board a Cham Wings flight from Rostov. The flights were the main route for transporting the contractors, said the man, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Vladimir. He said the contractors occasionally use Russian military aircraft too, when they can't all fit on the Cham Wings jets.Two employees at Rostov airport talked to Reuters about the men on the mysterious flights to Syria.\"Our understanding is that these are contractors,\" said an employee who said he assisted with boarding for several of the Syria flights. He pointed to their destination, the fact there were no women among them and that they carried military-style rucksacks. He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he wasn't authorised to speak to the media.Reuters wasn't able to establish how many passengers were carried between Russia and Syria, and it is possible that some of those on board were not in Syria in combat roles. Some may have landed in Damascus, then flown to other destinations outside Syria.Interviews with relatives of contractors killed in Syria also indicate the A320 flights to Rostov are used to transport Russian military contractors. The widow of one contractor killed in Syria said the last time she spoke to her husband by phone was on Jan 21 last year - the same day, according to flight-tracking data, that a Cham Wings charter flew to Syria.\"He called on the evening of the 21st ... There were men talking and the sound of walkie-talkies. And by the 22nd he was already not reachable. Only text messages were reaching him,\"said the woman, who had previously visited her husband at a training camp for the contractors in southern Russia.After he was killed, she said, his body was delivered to Russia. She received a death certificate saying he had died of\"haemorrhagic shock from shrapnel and bullet wounds.\"The widows of two other contractors killed in Syria described how their husbands' bodies arrived back home. Like the first widow, they spoke on condition of anonymity. They said representatives of the organisation that recruited their husbands warned of repercussions if they spoke to the media.The two contractors had been on previous combat tours, their widows said. The women said they received death certificates giving Syria as the location of death. Reuters saw the certificates: On one, the cause of death was listed as\"carbonisation of the body\" - in other words, he burned to death.The other man bled to death from multiple shrapnel wounds, the certificate said.One of the widows recounted conversations with her husband after he returned from his first tour of duty to Syria. He told her that Russian contractors there are often sent into the thick of the battle and are the first to enter captured towns, she said.Syrian government forces then come into the town and raise their flags, he told her, taking credit for the victory.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

According to one scholar, Russia helped build the modern Syrian military, and Mr Assad is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's strongest allies in the Middle East.Russia has often blocked meaningful international action on Syria by vetoing proposals at the UN Security Council, and Moscow changed the course of the war in Mr Assad's favour with a military intervention in 2015.The United States has been reluctant to become too entangled in Syria, but it has acted for two main reasons.First, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) began developing a foothold in the country in 2013.The next year, the United States launched air strikes against the militant group. It eventually sent ground troops into the fight, and about 2,000 US forces are now deployed there.Second, the United States has acted to punish the Assad government for using chemical weapons such as sarin and chlorine gas on Syrian civilians.In 2012, President Barack Obama called the use of chemical weapons a \"red line\" that would prompt military intervention.The following year, a sarin gas attack in Eastern Ghouta killed about 1,400 people, according to the US government's assessment.Mr Obama pushed for a strike but couldn't get congressional approval.Instead, he came up with a diplomatic solution. The UN Security Council ordered Mr Assad to destroy his chemical weapons stockpile and sign the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits countries from producing, stockpiling or using chemical weapons.There have been several reports of chemical weapons attacks since then.One particularly bad strike took place April 4, 2017. Nearly 100 people were killed in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun in an apparent sarin attack.It garnered worldwide headlines and the attention of President Trump, who expressed horror at the images of \"innocent children, innocent babies\" poisoned by a nerve agent.Just a few days after that attack, Mr Trump authorised a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base.It was the first direct US strike on the Syrian regime in the war.One of Mr Assad's key allies is Iran. Iran needs Syria to move its weapons and proxy militias across the Middle East.So when Mr Assad seemed threatened, Iran stepped in to support him. So did Hizbollah, the Lebanese political party and militia that is a close ally of Teheran.That upset Iran's rivals in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Turkey. So they began sending arms and money to anti-Assad rebels, including extremist militias.Israel has begun attacking Assad bases with air strikes.That means that today, there are many wars being fought inside Syria. The Syrian government is still at war with the rebels. Israel is at war with Iranian-backed forces. And the United States is trying to kill off ISIS.Horrible. Syrian families often don't have basic necessities, like food, shelter and medical care. Children can't go to school. The war is being fought in towns and on the streets.Since the start of the war, more than 465,000 Syrians have been killed, 1 million more have been injured, and 12 million - more than half the country's population - have been forced to flee their homes.More than 5.5 million have moved abroad and registered as refugees.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Their mouths and noses were covered with foam.Other videos showed victims including children being treated for breathing problems and hosed down.Doctors and aid organisations on the ground reported strong smells of chlorine, and described symptoms consistent with exposure to sarin, a nerve agent.Medics and rescuers said the alleged chemical attack killed more than 40 people and injured hundreds.Both the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ally Russia have denied responsibility.Here are accounts from survivors of the alleged chemical attack, medical workers, and those displaced during the seven-year civil war.The twin girls refused to leave behind their pink Dora the Explorer backpacks when they were evacuated from Douma last week, said their mother, Umm Nour.Now at al-Bol refugee camp in Aleppo province, Malaz unzipped her backpack and pulled out a cardboard box. It contained a little blonde doll.\"She spoke to the doll, telling her, 'you might suffocate but you will be safe from the bombing',\" said Umm Nour, adding that her daughter's voice was filled with sorrow when she said that.\"Yesterday, they were playing, they were digging a trench, a tunnel for the ants outside our tent,\" Umm Nour told CNN. \"They told me it was so the ants could have a place to hide and stay safe if there was an attack.\"The twins said they want to be doctors when they grow up so they can save wounded children.Referring to the popular uprising of March 2011, which later spiralled into civil war, Umm Nour said of her daughters: \"They were two months old when the revolution began. What have they seen in life, what do they know that is pure or kind?\"All they have seen is blood, the dead, the wounded.\"\"I was coming up the stairs from the basement and got an indescribable tightness in the chest, inability to breathe, and headache...I went back downstairs and started splashing water on myself, wiping my face, and splashing more water.\"\"When the smell hit us, we threw up. My mouth filled with phlegm. I couldn't stop coughing,\" said Malak, who was underground when the alleged chemical strike happened.\"We got to a clinic, where they hosed us with water and gave us oxygen.\"Holding up the key to his house in Douma, Malak's husband, Dervish, said: \"I brought it with me. Maybe one day we will be able to go back.\"They have two children, three years old and four months old.\"His pupils were dilated and he had foam in his mouth. His heart was very slow,\" the medical student said of a man he treated.\"Then he coughed blood into his mouth as well. I could see he was going to die.\"\"I felt my throat close, my body go limp as if I had just had everything sucked out of me,\" said Umm Nour, who was with her family in a basement when the toxic rounds hit.When she and her twin daughters reached the fourth floor, their building was shelled.\"It was like we were between two deaths - the chemical attack on the lower floors and the other strikes hitting the upper ones,\" she recalled.\"What really got my attention was...this little boy who was hit by a sniper. So there's somebody out there who had the ability to look through a telescope, and knew he was shooting a 12-year-old boy,\" said the surgeon, who declined to give his name.\"There were times when they aimed for pregnant women, and aimed to shoot the baby. What were the political affiliations of those children in the womb? What kind of threat were they to anybody?\"\"The thing which... affected me the most was seeing the children. When it starts affecting children, that's where I draw the line,\" said the Syrian-American doctor at the al-Amal Hospital in Turkey, near the Syrian border. He is based in the United States and travels to Turkey to volunteer as a surgeon at the hospital.\"I think in this war you have a whole generation exposed to massive trauma. It's going to affect how they grow, how they think.\"\"I was young when we fled. My father said we used to live a normal life in Syria. I wish I could remember it,\" said the teenager. He has been living in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan for five years.\"Our children, who were born during the war, know nothing about what normal life would look like,\" said the activist in Eastern Ghouta in Syria.\"They do not know the different types of fruits.

Locals protested after 15 schoolchildren were arrested and reportedly tortured for writing anti-government graffiti on a wall. The protest began peacefully, with the protesters asking for the release of the children and calling for democracy and greater freedom in the country.The government, however, responded angrily and the army opened fire on the protesters on March 18, 2011, killing four people. The next day, they shot at mourners at the funerals, killing another person. The public outrage spread to other parts of the country, triggering nationwide protests demanding Mr Assad's resignation.By July that year, hundreds of thousands of people were taking to the streets across Syria. Opposition supporters began taking up arms, first to defend themselves and later to push out security forces from their local areas.The country eventually plunged into civil war, with anti-government rebel groups battling government forces for control of cities and towns. The fighting reached the Syrian capital Damascus and second city of Aleppo in 2012.Successive rounds of peace talks, including a United Nations-sponsored meeting in Geneva in March 2017, have failed to produce a political breakthrough.Those demanding that Mr Assad steps down include rebel fighters, political parties who disagree with the Syrian leader, and those living in exile who cannot return to the country. The conflict has also pitched the country's Sunni majority against the president's Shia Alawite sect.In addition, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has capitalised on the chaos and taken control of large swathes of Syria and Iraq, where it has proclaimed the creation of a caliphate in June 2014. Its foreign fighters are involved in a \"war within a war\" in Syria, battling rebels and rival militants from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, as well as government and Kurdish forces.Almost half a million people are estimated to have been killed and more than 11 million, about half the population, are displaced either internally or as refugees, putting Syria in the international spotlight. Syrians fleeing the conflict are faced with rising anti-foreigner sentiment, or xenophobia, in countries that are grappling with security threats like terrorism and crimes.The conflict has caused at least US$16 billion (S$23 billion) in damage to agriculture - about a third of the country's Gross Domestic Product, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has said, calling for more funds to salvage local food production as millions go hungry. The fightings have led to extensive crop and livestock losses, and destroyed greenhouses, veterinary clinics, irrigation systems, tractors and other assets.More than seven million people in Syria are classified as \"food insecure\", meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from, according to the FAO.Russia has significant economic and military interests in Syria, such as a Mediterranean naval base at Tartus, and it is in Russia's interest that the Assad regime does not collapse.President Vladimir Putin also wants to send a message to the world that Russia is still a force to be reckoned with. The US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the 2011 toppling of Muammar Gadhafi's Libyan regime - helped by an international coalition bombing campaign - left Moscow deprived of key allies. Syria under Mr Assad is seen by the Kremlin as a key pillar of its strategic influence in the Middle East and Moscow is reluctant to let it go.Moscow is also concerned with rising Islamic violence. It fears an ISIS victory in Syria would have reverberations at home, as some of the top military commanders of the militant group are Russian speakers of Chechen origin.Because of its interests in Syria, Russia has blocked resolutions critical of Mr Assad at the UN Security Council and has continued to supply weapons to the Syrian military despite international criticism.In response to the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun, France and the US have put forward a draft UN resolution demanding a full investigation into the attack. Russia's deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov told the UN council that the proposed resolution was hastily prepared and unnecessary, but he voiced support for an inquiry.Under Mr Barack Obama's administration, the US made Mr Assad's departure a key goal. In August 2013, a sarin gas attack around the town of Ghouta left hundreds dead and Washington said Mr Assad had crossed a \"red line\".Mr Obama threatened an air campaign to topple him but called it off at the last minute when the Syrian leader agreed to give up his chemical arsenal under a deal brokered by Moscow.In mid-2014 as Washington increased support to moderate rebels to fight Mr Assad's regime, US officials privately conceded that the Syrian leader wasn't going anywhere soon and admitted the difficulty in removing him. By September 2015, then US Secretary of State John Kerry said Mr Assad had to go but the timing of his departure should be decided through negotiation.Before Mr Donald Trump became president, he had strongly urged Mr Obama not to order military intervention against the Assad regime. And he came to office promising both to improve ties with Syria's ally Russia and to focus US efforts in Syria solely on the defeat of the ISIS.But following the chemical attack on Tuesday, Mr Trump condemned it as a \"horrific\" strike against \"innocent people, including women, small children and even beautiful little babies\".Asked if it crossed a red line for him, he replied: \"It crossed a lot of lines for me... Beyond a red line. Many, many lines.\"Reports said his remarks may suggest a greater US role in protecting the Syrian population in a vicious civil war that he has always said the US should avoid.SOURCES: BBC, Reuters, AFPWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

ISIS has been finally defeated, and is now reduced to the role of a marginal if not irrelevant Middle Eastern player.But that will count for little when it comes to restoring any stability in the region. The victors in Raqqa are a mixed force of Arabs and ethnic Kurds dominated by the YPG, the disciplined and experienced Syrian Kurdish fighters' organisation linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party in neighbouring Turkey, a movement which is itself regarded as a terrorist organisation.Turkey will not tolerate for long the YPG's success, mainly because it fears this would lead to trouble within Turkey itself. Turkey's armed forces already operate inside Syrian territory, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is threatening a full-scale invasion unless the Kurds are pushed back.And Syria's own Sunni Arabs are also not happy with the presence of Kurdish fighters inside Raqqa, the heartland of Sunni Syria. Kicking out ISIS kept all these disputes in abeyance. Now that this task is over, the real fight between Kurds, Arabs and Turks will intensify. And the United States, which provided logistical and intelligence help to the siege of Raqqa, faces an even bigger quandary.US security planners would dearly like Syria's Kurds to turn now against the militias inside Syria that owe their allegiance to Iran, in order to reduce Iran's baleful influence. But quite apart from the fact that this may be too late as Iran is well ensconced in Syria, there is also the question of Turkey's opposition to any such move.One conclusion is, sadly, certain: Raqqa's fall only means Syria's civil war changes tack and intensifies.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

It recommended that the UN Security Council refer the findings to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecutions.Karen AbuZayd, an American commissioner on the panel, said the documented cases represented the \"tip of the iceberg\".Government forces raped civilians during house searches and ground operations in the early stages of the conflict, and later at checkpoints and detention facilities, the report said.The youngest known victim was a nine-year-old girl.\"Rape of women and girls was documented in 20 government political and military intelligence branches, and rape of men and boys was documented in 15 branches,\" the UN war crimes investigators said.The independent experts - who have compiled confidential lists of suspects since 2011 - did not name individual perpetrators but said they had documented \"numerous\" cases of rapes by high-level officers.\"Sexual violence against females and males is used to force confessions, to extract information, as punishment as well as to terrorise opposition communities,\" the report said.Victims suffered shame, depression, incontinence, impotence and miscarriages, and rejection by their families, it said.\"Some interviewees have indicated it is worse for a girl to be raped than to be killed,\" AbuZayd said. \"A number of women and girls sometimes commit suicide due to the verbal abuse they suffered in their homes or communities.\"AbuZayd said that rape of men and boys was often overlooked but also devastating.\"It's an exceedingly ugly crime. We know it's awful for women, but it's pretty bad for men as well.\"They were forced to have intercourse with one another and with other relatives. They tell you about losing their masculinity, becoming impotent. They were gang-raped or with objects and things, having some really serious consequences of illness and incontinence,\" AbuZayd said.The investigators found \"no evidence of a systematic practice\" by armed groups to use sexual violence, but some incidents had occurred in sectarian or revenge attacks.They received allegations of extremist and terrorist groups imposing \"mediaeval punishments on men accused of homosexuality\", including throwing them off tall buildings.\"On Islamic State, we recorded women being stoned for adultery, frequently for violations of the dress code, detention and beatings of women including pregnant women for minor violations, and forced physical examination to determine virginity,\" said Hanny Megally, a UN commissioner.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

And it could create another dangerous moment with the potential to escalate the seven-year civil war into a wider conflict.Already, multiple global and regional powers have been sucked in. Last week saw the tensest standoff in decades between nuclear rivals Russia and the US. On the ground, American and Turkish soldiers occupy separate chunks of the country's north, while Iranians and Russians fight alongside Mr Assad's army.In the skies, Israel has for the most part enjoyed freedom of manoeuvre, thanks to its air superiority - and an implicit green light from Moscow. Both conditions may now change.Mr Amos Yadlin has firsthand experience of how Israel responds to such threats - and no doubts about how it would handle this one.A former military intelligence chief, Mr Yadlin was also one of the Israeli pilots who destroyed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. The deployment of S-300s in Syria has been a concern for two decades, and \"at the end of the day, it will happen\", he said.\"If I know the air force well, we have already made proper plans to deal with this threat. After you remove the threat, which is basically what will be done, we're back to square one.\"Russia already has sold S-300 systems to Iran over American and Israeli objections. Syria was on track to get them too - until 2013, when Russian President Vladimir Putin froze the contract in response to pleas from Israel.But Mr Putin said at the time that if the US attacked, Moscow would \"think how we should act in the future\".That moment arrived with last week's missile strikes by the US, Britain and France, in response to an alleged chemical attack by Mr Assad's army.Hours afterwards, Russia's first deputy chief of staff, Mr Sergei Rudskoi, said his government would reconsider whether to supply the air defences to Mr Assad. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hammered home the message in a BBC interview two days later, saying the plan might be revived because Russia feels it must do \"whatever is required to help the Syrian army deter aggression\".Israel has carried out at least 150 bombing raids in Syria since the civil war began in 2011, according to Mr Zvi Magen, a former Israeli ambassador in Moscow. The latest, on April 9, hit an air base used by the Iranian military; other targets have included arms convoys bound for Hezbollah, the Iranian-armed Shiite group in Lebanon that has repeatedly fought with Israel.S-300s can fire missiles at six targets simultaneously, and have a range of 200km. That would extend into the airspace of Lebanon, sometimes used by Israeli planes to strike Syria - and even into Israel itself.\"It's an exceptionally advanced system that can cover large swaths of territory,\" said r Michael Oren, Israel's deputy minister for public diplomacy and an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Given Israel's likely response, some analysts in Moscow say it makes more sense to use the threatened deployment as a bargaining chip.Actually delivering the weapons \"would fuel tensions in the region and cause major friction with Israel\", said Ms Elena Suponina, a Middle East expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, which advises the Kremlin.\"It's enough to provide Syria with other air-defence systems that won't provoke such a response.\"Even Syria's current Soviet-designed systems, which have been upgraded over the last 18 months, have inflicted some damage. In February, an F-16 was shot down, said to be the first Israeli aircraft lost in action since the early 1980s.And while the Pentagon says that all of the more than 100 missiles fired in last week's strike reached their targets, Russia says that two-thirds of them were intercepted. A pro-opposition Syrian monitoring group, citing aerial defence officers, made a similar estimate.\"Syria already has some good short- and medium-range systems,\" said Mr Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor at Jane's Defence Weekly. Add the S-300s, and \"they would be able to form a fairly comprehensive, multi-layered air defence umbrella over their country\".In any attempt to destroy the new weapons, Israel would probably use US-built F-35 stealth aircraft and electronic warfare, he said.Russian military experts say that while the S-300 is very powerful, it is not foolproof.\"There's no invincible air-defence system,\" said Mr Viktor Murakhovsky, a former army colonel who is now a government adviser. \"Just like there are no invincible aircraft.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Russia and Iran played a major part in that outcome - but they cannot afford a bill estimated at a quarter-trillion dollars.Enter China?Mr Qin Yong, vice-president of the China-Arab Exchange Association, said he sees burgeoning interest among Chinese companies.\"We get phone queries every day,\" he said. \"They see huge business potential there because the entire country needs to be rebuilt.\"The enthusiasm is reciprocated on the Syrian side, said Mr Qin. \"They're like, don't come tomorrow, come tonight.\"As the 61/2-year war winds down, with President Bashar al-Assad still in power, the battle for influence in Syria has shifted to the diplomatic arena. Reconstruction, which the United Nations said could cost US$250 billion (S$336 billion), is a key part of it.Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared victory in his two-year military operation to shore up Mr Assad and is now appealing for international funds. At his annual press conference on Dec 14, Mr Putin showed signs of frustration.He said Syria, whose conflict sparked the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, will remain a breeding ground for extremist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria without improved living standards.\"All people of goodwill around the world should understand that if we do not resolve this together, it will be their problem as well,\" he said.The United States and its European and Gulf Arab allies, which backed the Syrian rebels, said that problem is largely of Mr Putin and Mr Assad's making. They have eased up on calls for the Syrian leader's immediate departure, but continue to insist that he cannot stabilise the country and has no long-term future.Withholding money for reconstruction is one of the few cards they have left. Syria has little ability to generate cash internally to pay for its own rebuilding.Diplomats in Moscow said Russia has repeatedly pressed EU governments to help foot the bill. At the same time, Russia has rebuffed calls for Mr Assad to step down eventually, and his government has shown few signs of willingness to share power.The European Union, Arab nations and the US put aside US$9.7 billion in April for humanitarian aid and rebuilding Syria. But Mr Assad insists nations which supported the Syrian opposition in the civil war will not get a role in reconstruction, even if they want one.Mr Abd al-Kader Azouz, a consultant to Mr Assad's government, said money can be found from wealthy Syrians, the Brics group of emerging economies and multilateral lenders not controlled by the West.A few deals have been reached. Last year, Syria said it had agreed on €850 million (S$1.4 billion) worth of contracts for Russia to rebuild infrastructure. Iran signed accords worth \"several hundred million euros\" to repair power grids, Press TV reported in September.Mr Qin's association estimated there could be US$2 billion worth of investment at this stage.He said the companies he has been escorting to Damascus, Homs and Tartus, including China National Heavy Duty Truck Company, are eyeing projects to build roads, bridges, airports and hospitals and restore electricity and communications.That may just be the beginning because Syria fits into Chinese strategy. The country was a key link on the ancient Silk Road, and President Xi Jinping's most ambitious plan involves building a new one - the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to weave a Chinese web of trade and transportation links across Eurasia and Africa.For all those grand visions, there is an immediate obstacle for Chinese business in Syria, according to Mr Qin: Settlements in dollars and euros are banned because of US and EU sanctions aimed at cutting Mr Assad's regime off from the world economy.That is one indicator that, without a compromise on Mr Assad's future, Syria is likely to remain partially destroyed for years to come. Professor Robert Ford, who was US ambassador to Damascus during the early years of the war and is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington and a Yale professor, said the deals mooted so far are a drop in the ocean.\"We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars,\" he said. \"Syria needs billions. It's going to fall well short of what's needed to rebuild the country, which means that the country won't be rebuilt very quickly.\"WASHINGTON POSTWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

There is also a likelihood that militants trained by ISIS in Syria will commit attacks in Russia.And the ISIS threat has already hit Russia, with Moscow admitting last week that an ISIS-claimed bomb blew up a plane of Russian tourists that took off from Egypt.The former Soviet Union, which Russia was the biggest state of, used to be the dominant power in the Middle East, but had in recent decades seen its influence diminish. Syria is Russia's sole remaining ally and the only place in the region where the once-mighty Russian navy still has a base.Western powers had been intervening in Syria's civil war for years, and have actively called for Mr Assad's removal, but they have failed to unseat him.Mr Putin's sudden move to send troops to support Mr Assad can be seen as him not wanting to lose Russia's last ally in the Middle East, and also wanting to have a say in Mr Assad's successor when he eventually departs.It is also part of the wider effort to counter what Russia sees as the United States' influence globally in instilling democratic revolutions in countries like Ukraine after the Soviet era.As Russia's influence diminished not only in the Middle East but globally, Mr Putin has been on a crusade to restore national pride.His decisive and muscular intervention in the Syrian conflict - coming soon after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and the involvement in Ukraine's own civil war - has allowed him to project an aggressive image, and renewed Russia's standing, for better or for worse, in the eyes of the world.The fact that it took Western powers, especially the United States, by surprise in its intervention, leaving them floundering for a response, is another important point. It shows that Russia can act unilaterally and in total secret, which contrasts with the style of Western leaders who tend to talk first and act later, if at all.And after Russia has acted, there is little Western powers can do except issue condemnations, short of a direct confrontation, which no country has the appetite for.Mr Putin remains popular among the Russian people precisely for this rapacious image, despite the faltering Russian economy.Observers have suggested that the Russian intervention is about energy supplies.The Middle East is crucial to the global supply price of oil and gas, which are also Russia's chief trading commodities.Saudi Arabia's decision to hold down prices in an effort to regain market share against shale oil producers has damaged the Russian economy.By intervening in Syria, it is sending a message to the Saudis that it is a player in the politics of oil.Another benefit of the Syria campaign is that it diverts attention from the war in Ukraine, which Russia had a hand in after taking over Crimea. Pro-Russia rebels also started a revolt in east Ukraine. The crisis went so far as to be responsible for the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane, reports claim.Russia was slapped with sanctions over the saga, but now the West has something else to fill its Russia roster with besides Ukraine.Bonus trivia: The rate of sorties being flown by Russian jets over Syria has been described as impressive, as they seem to be generating close to a theoretical maximum number possible for 32 fixed-wing combat aircraft - if the information provided by Russia about their operations is accurate.As many as 96 fixed-wing combat aircraft sorties per day can be carried out, assuming maximally efficient logistics and maintenance.Most military officials predicted a rate of 20 sorties per day.In the latest report, Russia's air force flew 141 sorties and hit 472 terrorist targets in Syria over the Nov 21 and 22, the RIA news agency quoted the Russian Defence Ministry as saying on Monday (Nov 23).Sources: Reuters, Time.com, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The National Interest, Straits Times archivesWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria crisis, said in Beirut.Syria is the worst place in modern history in terms of attacks on healthcare workers and facilities, accounting for 70 percent of all such attacks worldwide, he said.U.N. data shows 89 healthcare workers died in 92 confirmed military attacks on healthcare facilities between Jan 1 and May 4, compared to 73 killed in 112 attacks in the whole of 2017, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria crisis.The two areas which saw the most healthcare attacks in 2018 were Eastern Ghouta and Idlib.Eastern Ghouta had been the largest rebel-held pocket near the capital Damascus, but came back under government control in mid-April after a fierce offensive.Idlib, in northwest Syria, is the largest remaining area under opposition control, containing around 2.5 million people.Idlib's population has ballooned over the course of the conflict, with people there from fighting inn other areas. The government has also transferred a large number of rebel fighters and their families to Idlib as part of surrender deals elsewhere in Syria.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to take back every inch of Syria.Moumtzis said the U.N. does not want to see a repeat of what happened in Ghouta happen in Idlib. He urged the warring sides to come to a peaceful solution.Moumtzis also said he was concerned about poor aid access in Syria.In 2017, 27 percent of requests made by the U.N. to Syrian authorities for permission to deliver aid were granted. In the first four months of 2018 only seven percent were granted, Moumtzis said.The number of people designated by the U.N. as living in besieged areas has fallen dramatically this year to stand at 11,100, after the Syrian government took back control of almost all rebel-held pockets around the capital Damascus.But 2.05 million people in need of humanitarian assistance still live in hard-to-reach areas, the U.N. said.(Reporting by Lisa Barrington; editing by Andrew Roche)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/2018-worst-year-in-syria-s-humanitarian-crisis---un-official-10248630","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:36:25.920Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Six others had died while receiving treatment.Footage posted online by the White Helmets, which was not possible to verify, showed victims with yellowed skin crumpled on the ground and foaming at the mouth.Douma is the last remaining opposition-held town in Eastern Ghouta, once the rebels' main bastion outside Damascus but now ravaged by a seven-week regime assault.Since Feb 18, Syrian and Russian forces have waged a fierce military onslaught.WHO WAS BEHIND IT?While no one has yet provided evidence of its involvement, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country's seven-year civil war.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the regime carried out a wave of air strikes on Douma on Friday and Saturday that killed nearly 100 people, including many who suffered breathing difficulties.Syria and its Russian ally denounced the claims as \"fabrications\", with Russia warning of potential \"dire consequences\" if they were used as a pretext for military action.HOW HAS THE WORLD REACTED?US President Donald Trump warned there would be a \"big price to pay\".\"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"President (Vladimir) Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay.\"The EU said signs suggested the Syrian regime carried out the Douma attack and urged Russia and Iran to help prevent another one.\"The evidence points towards yet another chemical attack by the regime,\" the European Union's diplomatic arm said, calling for \"an immediate response\" from the international community.United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was \"particularly alarmed\" by the attack, adding that if confirmed, the use of chemical weapons would be \"abhorrent\".Britain called for an investigation into what it said were the \"deeply disturbing\" reports, and Turkey, which has backed rebels against Assad, said it had a \"strong suspicion\" the Syrian president was to blame.France has repeatedly said that evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria could prompt military action and said Sunday it would \"do its duty\" following the latest allegations. It called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting.Pope Francis described the allegations as \"terrible news\", saying: \"Nothing, nothing can justify the use of such devices of extermination against defenceless people and populations.\"WILL MILITARY ACTION BE TAKEN?White House security adviser Tom Bossert refused to rule out US military action in response to the alleged chemical strike. \"I wouldn't take anything off the table,\" he said.US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the reports, if confirmed, \"are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community.\"Prominent Republican senator Lindsey Graham warned Trump that a failure to act now could leave him in a weakened posture internationally.\"It's a defining moment in his presidency,\" Graham said.WHAT OTHER MAJOR CHEMICAL ATTACKS?A chemical attack with the nerve agent sarin in the Eastern Ghouta enclave in August 2013 killed 1,429 people, including children, the US says.Sarin was also detected in an April 2017 attack on the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhun that killed more than 80 people.

Security Council, including President Bashar al-Assad's strongest ally Russia, passed a resolution on Saturday calling for a 30-day countrywide ceasefire. But the measure has not taken effect, with Moscow and Damascus saying they are battling members of terrorist groups excluded from the truce.Russia has instead called for daily five-hour local ceasefires to establish what it calls a humanitarian corridor so aid can enter the enclave and civilians and wounded can leave.The first such truce took place on Tuesday but quickly collapsed when bombing and shelling resumed after a short lull.There were no air strikes during Wednesday's five-hour ceasefire, but heavy bombardment resumed in the afternoon, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported.There has been no sign of aid deliveries to the besieged area.President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had managed to evacuate \"quite a big group\" of civilians and that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had helped broker the evacuation. He did not say when the civilians had managed to leave.The Observatory said it could not confirm the evacuation.Moscow and Damascus have accused rebels of shelling the corridor to prevent people leaving. Rebels deny this, and say people will not depart eastern Ghouta because they fear the government.Wednesday's ground assault targeted the Hawsh al-Dawahra area at the eastern edge of the enclave.The Observatory reported advances by the government forces in the area, describing it as the resumption of an assault that first began on Feb. 25. It said rebels had inflicted heavy losses on government forces.An official with one of the rebel groups in eastern Ghouta said fighters were battling to repel an attempted incursion, and characterised the battle as \"back and forth\".A commander in the military alliance that backs Assad said an elite unit of the Syrian army, the Tiger Force, was taking part in the assault and advances had been made.France's foreign ministry called on Russia and Iran, Assad's other military ally, to exert \"maximum pressure\" on the Syrian government to implement the 30-day ceasefire.But with no sign of decisive international pressure to stop the attack, eastern Ghouta appears on course to eventually meet the same fate as other areas won back by the government in lengthy, punishing assaults, where rebels and civilians who oppose Assad were finally evacuated in negotiated withdrawals.Damascus appears to be applying tried and tested military means, combining air strikes and bombardment with ground assaults, as it did to recapture eastern Aleppo in 2016.A senior Western diplomat said Russia appeared intent on a repeat of Aleppo in eastern Ghouta by evacuating the area and then killing \"the terrorists even if it's not just Nusra\", a reference to a jihadist group with al Qaeda links.A senior U.S. general on Tuesday accused Moscow of acting as \"both arsonist and firefighter\" by failing to rein in Assad.U.S., RUSSIA CLASH OVER CHEMICAL WEAPONSDiplomatic sources have said the chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, opened an investigation into attacks in eastern Ghouta to determine whether banned munitions were used.The United States says it has evidence Syrian forces have used chlorine, which is permitted for civilian purposes but banned as a weapon, in attacks in eastern Ghouta and elsewhere.U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said on Wednesday that Russia has violated its duty to guarantee the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile and prevent the Assad government from using poison gas.Syria agreed to give up its stockpile of poison gas and join the international chemical weapons ban in 2013 under a Russian-brokered deal that averted U.S. retaliatory air strikes after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Ghouta.Washington accused Damascus last year of again using nerve gas and carried out a round of air strikes as punishment.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Syria had eliminated its poison gas stockpiles, and described allegations it was still using chemical weapons as \"absurd\".U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman told the Security Council on Wednesday the scale of attacks by the Syrian government against eastern Ghouta “cannot be justified on the basis of targeting Jabhat al Nusra fighters.”“The air strikes, shelling, and ground offensives continue. There are even reports of yet another chlorine gas attack. What we need is implementation of 2401, and that is not happening,” Feltman said.Lavrov said militants entrenched in eastern Ghouta were blocking aid and the evacuation of people who want to leave. Moscow would continue to support the Syrian army in totally defeating the \"terrorist threat\", Lavrov told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.Rebels have intensified shelling of nearby government-held Damascus. A medical official in the capital said on Monday 36 people had been killed in four days. Damascus and Moscow say the campaign in eastern Ghouta is needed to halt such shelling.The multi-sided Syrian war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven half of the pre-war population of 23 million from their homes. Fighting has escalated on several fronts this year, with the collapse of Islamic State giving rise to conflict between other Syrian and foreign parties.As Assad has pressed the offensive against eastern Ghouta, Turkey has launched an incursion against Kurdish fighters in the northwestern Afrin region.(Reporting by Tom Perry, Laila Bassam and Dahlia Nehme in Beirut and Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles in Geneva, John Irish in Paris, Denis Pinchuk in Moscow, Michelle Nicols at the United Nations; writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Mark Heinrich)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/syrian-government-gains-ground-on-second-day-of-russian-truce-9999582","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:37:01.996Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77ccb34719c85521657379"},"header":"Fresh violence mars first day of Syria enclave 'truce'","time":null,"content":"DOUMA, Syria: A \"humanitarian pause\" announced by Russia in Syria's deadly bombardment of Eastern Ghouta failed to end violence on Tuesday (Feb 27), with fresh bloodshed and no sign of aid deliveries or residents leaving the besieged enclave.Nine days after Russian-backed regime forces intensified their campaign against the rebel-held enclave, the deal offered some respite to civilians who had been hiding in their basements.But the first day of a five-hour daily \"pause\" that was ordered by President Vladimir Putin on Sunday and kicked off at 9.00am (3.00pm Singapore time) was marred by violence that saw six people killed.Moscow's plan falls short of a broader 30-day ceasefire it agreed to at the United Nations Security Council but which has yet to take effect, and has inspired little trust from among the besieged enclave's 400,000 residents.The regime deployed buses at the Al-Wafideen checkpoint to transport residents wanting to use a humanitarian corridor to flee what UN chief Antonio Guterres last called \"hell on earth\".But no civilians were seen venturing towards the regime forces guarding the checkpoint, where large portraits of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Putin could be seen side-by-side.The \"humanitarian pause\" ordered by Putin echoed a similar tactic employed by Russia and Syrian regime during the ferocious battle to force rebels out of Aleppo in 2016.Russia's defence ministry accused armed groups in Eastern Ghouta of shelling the corridor, and said rebel fighters had \"continued attacking the positions of the government forces\" and \"went on the offensive in other directions too\".Syrian state news agency SANA said a former Al-Qaeda affiliate present in the enclave was blocking civilians \"to use them as human shields\".'TRUCE A FARCE'Some residents left the basements they had been cowering in for days to check on their property and buy food.But many in the enclave, which lies on the eastern outskirts of the Syrian capital, appeared distrustful of a \"pause\" announced by Damascus's main ally.\"This Russian truce is a farce. Russia is killing us and bombing us every day,\" said Samer al-Buaidhani, a 25-year-old from Douma, Eastern Ghouta's main hub.\"I don't believe it's safe for me or my family to leave by this system,\" he told AFP.International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said any evacuation needed deeper coordination.\"Under international humanitarian law, humanitarian corridors are things which need to be well planned and must be implemented with the consent of parties on all sides, not only with one side,\" she told AFP.Violence levels were significantly lower on Tuesday as the \"humanitarian pause\" kicked in but six civilians were killed by regime bombardment, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.The bombardment intensified again after 2.00pm (8.00pm Singapore time), the Britain-based group said.Since Feb 18, 582 civilians, almost a quarter of them children, have been killed in the Syrian and Russian bombardment of Eastern Ghouta, making it one of the bloodiest episodes of the country's seven-year-old conflict.Fourteen of the dead, including five children, were pulled from the rubble on Tuesday after being killed in the past two days, said the Observatory.In Damascus, the state news agency said, a civilian was killed and five others wounded by shelling from \"terrorist organisations\".ALEPPO SCENARIOIn Hammuriyeh, another town in the sprawling semi-rural enclave, Mohammed Abdullah said the pause left civilians with a choice between two evils.\"The truce is not in the people's interest, we have two options: death or displacement,\" said the 30-year-old.\"The campaign we were targeted with was an extermination campaign, not a simple bombardment. What we want is a full and permanent ceasefire for all of Ghouta,\" he said.That sentiment was echoed by the dominant rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta, who sent a letter to the United Nations stating their willingness to expel militants as soon as a full ceasefire takes effect.The main rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam, Faylaq al-Rahman and Ahrar al-Sham - declared their \"complete commitment to deport\" militant fighters.Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group made up mostly of fighters from Al-Qaeda's ex-affiliate Al-Nusra Front, is present in some parts of the enclave.The letter said such an evacuation, which has been discussed previously but never yielded any result, would take 15 days and start when a UN truce takes effect.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reacted cautiously to the statement and said after meeting French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian that the ball was in the rebel groups' court.\"We shall see in practice whether the pleas by the three illegal armed groups ... to carry out the UNSC resolution correspond with their intentions,\" he said.A top US general accused Moscow of playing an \"incredibly destabilising\" role in Syria by claiming it wants to settle the civil war while at the same time stoking the conflict.The Syrian government lost control of Eastern Ghouta in 2012 and has besieged it almost ever since.The latest scenario put in place by the regime and its Russian ally was reminiscent of the deal that ended the battle of Aleppo in 2016.Few civilians back then initially used the Aleppo corridors unilaterally announced by Russia.Some started fleeing after renewed bombardment and the rest eventually evacuated when a multilateral deal was reached with Turkey.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/fresh-violence-mars-first-day-of-syria-enclave-truce-9997608","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:37:21.630Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The world has been shocked by stories of incredible hardship faced by migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea, and images of those who do not make it, like the toddler whose body was found floating in the surf. Such heartbreaking stories also make their way back to Syria adding to the anxiety of those still planning to leave.But that anxiety is still better than coping with the constant fear of day-to-day life in war-torn Syria. Nearly five years of civil war has left the country devastated – and its people, hopeless and homeless.  Those who have not yet left, are struggling to survive. Like Rami Nader, a 32-year-old father of two, who works 16 hours a day as patisserie chef and is planning to emigrate to Germany.\"I was living in Yarmouk – the Palestinian camp south of Damascus - when the rebels entered, we had to flee,” he said. “We had to spend the night in a public garden in Damascus for a few days until I found an apartment for rent. It’s expensive – around 30,000 Syrian pounds (US$159) - so I had to work two shifts to feed my children.\"Most Syrians wish to go to Germany after the country’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel, so clearly stated that they would be welcome there. Rami’s wife is already there living with his relatives. His dearest wish is to join them.\"Before the crisis, the situation was good, nobody wanted to emigrate, but now, because of the conditions and the high cost of living, it's too much,” he said. “We can easily die on our way to work from one of the many mortar bombs launched by the rebels – we are living in a constant state of fear and horror all the time.\"Sam Barjak, 13, cannot wait to leave. He dreams of becoming a doctor – and he knows he will have a much better chance realising his ambition in Hamburg where his uncle lives.\"I want to become a doctor in Germany and to make visits to Syria and treat people for free, so I will help Syria and also help Germany,” he said. Sam's family have prepared the necessary documentation and are ready to leave their war ravaged country.His older brother, Ajam, wants to play football in Germany, but Syria is his home and he does have some misgivings about leaving.\"For sure, our homeland is like our mother, one will certainly miss his homeland,” said Ajam. I'm going to develop myself and become successful, and when I succeed, I will come back to Syria to build something here, to do something for my homeland.\"About a million refugees are expected to have arrived in Germany by the end of 2015. Despite the cold autumn weather, thousands are still trekking across the Balkans and entering Germany via the Austrian border. Asser Khattab is a talented 21-year-old blogger and media student at Damascus University. Most of his friends have left and are already in Europe.\"The European culture is loved here in Syria,” said Asser. “They like Germany; they like the way that Germans think and work, and they like their attitudes.\"But the German authorities are increasingly overwhelmed after having processed so many refugees. And even those who initially supported Angela Merkel’s decision to welcome the refugees are now voicing concern that the numbers are simply too high.From the European perspective, the refugee crisis is really only affecting them now. But in \"ground zero\" in Syria, the exodus has been tearing families apart for almost five years. Today, not a single Syrian has been left unaffected by this war.

The mission had been a success, she said.\"This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change,\" May said in a statement made from her country residence at Chequers just minutes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the strikes from the White House.May later told reporters in her Downing Street office that the Western missiles struck a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks.By launching strikes without prior approval from parliament, May dispensed with a non-binding constitutional convention dating back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She said speed was essential and that military action was in the national interest.\"It was both right and legal to take military action,\" May said, adding that she would update parliament on Monday.The Western missile strikes demonstrate the volatile nature of the Syrian civil war, which started in March 2011 as an anti-Assad uprising but is now a proxy conflict involving a number of world and regional powers and a myriad of insurgent groups.Assad, May said, should not doubt the resolve of Britain, France and the United States but made clear that the strike was a specific response to the Douma attack which killed up to 75 people, including children.May dismissed as \"grotesque and absurd\" a claim by Russia, which intervened in the war in 2015 to back Assad, that the Douma attack was staged by Britain. But she declined to give any signal about the future of Assad.\"RIGHT AND LEGAL\"May referred specifically to last month's nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English cathedral city of Salisbury that she has blamed on Russia. Moscow has denied any involvement.\"We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere,\" May told reporters in Downing Street.She said almost a century of global acceptance about not using chemical weapons had been eroded in Douma and Salisbury.May said Britain and its allies had sought to use every diplomatic means to stop the use of chemical weapons, but had been repeatedly thwarted, citing a Russian veto of an independent investigation into the Douma attack at the U.N. Security Council this week.\"So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,\" she said.BOMBS DON'T BRING PEACEThe small Northern Irish political party that props up her government said May was justified in taking such action though it said wider intervention in Syria would be counter-productive.However, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a fervent anti-war campaigner, called the strikes \"legally questionable\" and said May should have recalled parliament from a holiday and \"not trailed after Donald Trump\".\"Bombs won’t save lives or bring about peace,\" he said. \"Britain should be playing a leadership role to bring about a ceasefire in the conflict, not taking instructions from Washington and putting British military personnel in harm's way.\"Many politicians in Britain, including some in May's own Conservative Party, had backed his call for parliament to give the authority for any military strike.A YouGov poll for The Times newspaper this week indicated that only a fifth of voters believed that Britain should launch attacks on Syrian military targets and 43 percent opposed action.Former Prime Minister David Cameron lost a parliamentary vote on air strikes against Assad's forces in 2013 when 30 Conservative lawmakers voted against action, with many Britons wary of entering another conflict after intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region.Cameron, though, gave his support of May on Saturday.\"As we have seen in the past, inaction has its consequences,\" he said.(Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill and William James; Writing by Michael Holden and Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Angus MacSwan and Peter Graff)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/britain-attacks-syria-with-cruise-missiles-to-deter-more-chemical-attacks-10138474","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:38:16.672Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Western states say recovery and reconstruction support for Syria depends on \"a credible political process leading to a genuine political transition that can be supported by a majority of the Syrian people\".Wang told Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior aide to Assad visiting China, that engagement over the future of Syria's political arrangements had intensified, and that he believed it would contribute to a formal peace process talks in Geneva.\"China hopes the Syrian side can seize the opportunity, display flexibility, and promote dialogue and negotiation to achieve substantive results,\" Wang said, according to a statement from China's foreign ministry.\"The international community should emphasize and actively support Syria's reconstruction. China will put forth its own effort for this,\" Wang said, without elaborating on what those efforts would be.Shaaban welcomed China playing a greater role in Syria's political resolution process, the ministry said.While relying on the Middle East for oil supplies, China tends to leave the region's diplomacy to the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, namely the United States, Britain, France and Russia.But China has been trying to get more involved, including sending envoys to help push for a diplomatic solution to the violence there and hosting Syrian government and opposition figures.China hopes a peaceful Middle East will also help end the involvement of ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim people from the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang, with militant groups in Syria and Iraq.(Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Robert Birsel and WIlliam Maclean)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-says-it-will-make-efforts-on-syria-reconstruction-9438096","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:38:37.222Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The Syrian army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces fought the Islamic State separately in Raqqa province this year, driving out IS from its main stronghold in Syria. (Xinhua/Ammar Safarjalani)by Hummam Sheikh AliDAMASCUS, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- The major achievement for Syria in 2017 was perhaps the defeat of the Islamic State (IS), a development that nourishes hopes and paves the way for a possible political solution to the nearly seven-year-old civil war in 2018, after several setbacks in the course of negotiations.FALL OF ISOn Oct. 17, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by the U.S., fully captured the northern city of Raqqa, almost three years after the terrorist group declared the city as the capital of its self-styled caliphate in Syria.It took the SDF four months to defeat the IS in Raqqa, with the heavy backing of the U.S.-led anti-terror coalition.According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor group, 3,250 people, including 1,130 civilians, were killed during the four-month intense battles in Raqqa.The London-based watchdog also said 80 percent of Raqqa was destroyed owing to the heavy bombing by both the SDF and the U.S.-led coalition.In tandem with the SDF's attacks on Raqqa, the Russian-backed Syrian army was making strides in the battles against IS militants in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour, which boasts key oil and gas fields and was thus deemed as the economic capital of the IS.On Nov. 3, the Syrian army declared the liberation of the entire city of Deir al-Zour from the IS, after months of battles in the capital city that bears the same name with the province.The army later defeated the IS in two key strongholds in the countryside of Deir al-Zour Province, namely the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal along the Iraqi border.To reach Deir al-Zour, the Syrian government forces with the backing of pro-government fighters, and the Lebanese group of Hezbollah launched a wide-scale military offensive in the Syrian Desert in the remote eastern countryside of Homs Province in central Syria.The campaign started in May and initially focused on eliminating rebel threats along the highway from the capital Damascus to the border with Iraq.Its first goal was to capture both the highway and the al-Tanf border crossing, thus securing the Damascus countryside from a potential rebel attack.Later, multiple other fronts were opened throughout the desert, in addition to the anti-IS operation \"Grand Dawn\" which aimed to reopen the Damascus-Palmyra highway and prepare for an offensive toward Deir al-Zour.Along the way in the desert toward Deir al-Zour, the army recaptured Palmyra and other key IS strongholds.During the offensive in the desert, key gas and oil plants, including the Hayyan gas fields, the largest production facility of gas feeding electricity stations in central and southern Syria, were recaptured from the IS.The series of operations stripped the IS of its political and economic strongholds, so that the eradication of its remnants in the countryside of Deir al-Zour is just a matter of time.TENSION BETWEEN GOV'T AND KURDSIn the meantime, the Kurdish-led SDF was also attacking the IS in the northern countryside of Deir al-Zour, yet with different aims.The Syrian army's aim was to get all the areas captured by the IS back to the government control, while the U.S.-backed SDF was to consolidate its presence to realize its old dream of establishing an autonomy in Syria.There was no military or political confrontation between them at first.The Kurdish-led groups, however, repeatedly accused the government forces of targeting their areas, while the Syrian government refused to acknowledge the liberation of Raqqa, saying the city was occupied by the U.S. and Kurdish forces.Syrian officials repeatedly said the government will regain all lost areas, including those under the Kurdish control, while Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said Kurdish autonomy was not non-negotiable.On Dec. 20, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad described the SDF as \"new Daesh (IS),\" saying the SDF should be a part of Syria.The sharp comments came as the government perceives the Kurdish activities as separatist, despite the repeated remarks from the Kurds that they were not seeking independence.PROSPECT OF POLITICAL SETTLEMENTWhile the war on terror was successful in 2017, the wheels of political solution were moving slowly, as no concrete ground has been agreed on despite rounds of intra-Syrian talks in Geneva.The latest round of talks ended earlier this month, where the opposition renewed its stance that President Bashar al-Assad should leave as a prelude to the political solution, while the government maintained that no preconditions should be set ahead of the talks, and tried to give priority to counter-terrorism.On Dec. 14, UN envoy Staffan de Mistura warned against the repercussion of the failure of the eighth round of the Geneva talks.He said two weeks of talks failed to yield the intended results despite great efforts, which he described as a \"missed golden opportunity.\"In parallel with the Geneva talks were several rounds of talks in Astana, which were supported by Russia, Turkey and Iran. The Astana talks achieved the de-escalation zones deal for the cease-fire in four major hotspots in Syria.The first zone includes parts of the northwestern province of Idlib, as well as parts of the countryside of Latakia Province in northwestern Syria, western areas of Aleppo Province in northern Syria and northern areas of Hama Province in central Syria.The second zone includes Eastern Ghouta countryside of the capital Damascus, while the third one includes the towns of Rastan and Talbiseh in the northern countryside of Homs Province in central Syria.The fourth zone includes areas in the southern provinces of Daraa and Qunaitera.Eyes are now shifted toward the upcoming talks in Sochi brokered by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, particularly after the visit of Assad to Sochi last month and the visit of Putin to Syria this month.These visits were seen by analysts as paving a strong way for the Sochi talks, which are scheduled for early next year.On Dec. 18, Assad said his administration welcomes any role of the UN in possible Syrian elections as long as it respects the Syrian sovereignty, according to the Syrian presidential media office.The elections and constitution in Syria are expected to be discussed in the upcoming talks in Sochi.Assad said if there is a constitutional amendment, there will be elections based on it.After the most dangerous terror group Syria has ever known is collapsing in 2017, the best hope in 2018 should be that a better agreement could be reached to pave a stronger way for the final political solution.

Dusts were wiped off their images, while the face of the 65-year-old man was filled with sorrow, revealing his everlasting innermost grief.Deeb's house was in the rebel-held part during the battles. A rocket shell that slammed his three-storey house killed his wife and son, yet he survived with wounds in his head.\"Me, my wife and kids were still asleep when something slammed our building. I didn't know what it was at the time, but I lost my wife and son,\" he told Xinhua at the shattered entrance of his house.Despite the great loss and misfortune, Deeb said his faith was strong and he would never leave his home, which needs to be rebuilt from scratch. The house is like a shattered box filled with memories of his beloved ones that he would never be able to get over.\"I will not leave, where should I go? I will clean it and even if I had to stay in it like this, I will stay. This is my house, the fruit of my entire life and hard work,\" he said, choking back the tears.Houses in other neighborhoods in eastern Aleppo were all under the same condition. Zakariah Akeed, a man in his 60s, lived right next door.Akeed also lost two floors of his apartment building, but he was fortunate enough that none of his family members got hurt since they fled the neighborhood when the rebels took over in 2012. Now the man has returned and started fixing his house with two of his sons.\"I was happy that I came back, but when I saw the amount of destruction my brain was boiling. We started fixing what could be fixed but the restoration costs lots of money. That's why we put the reparation on hold,\" Akeed said he would still stay even though with no electricity and shortage of water.One of his son, Muhammad, said he goes to sleep every day after praying that the house would not collapse over their heads, as the cracks in the wall and the sinking parts of the house all indicate that it could fall down at any minute.\"I left here before the rebels took over and returned to find it badly damaged, and frankly I don't know how to fix this home. I hope I can get some help to rebuild it,\" he said.This is just one of the cases of all the families who started to return. Children were playing in the streets with innocent laughters, men in white garments were walking to pray in a half-destroyed mosque, and both the old and the young were trying to bring life back into this doomed area.Following intense battles, the rebels evacuated eastern Aleppo in December 2016. Now it is like a life-versus-death area, where young people's reverberating giggles are starting to cover the broken hearts.

However, the three nations carried out the strike on the day the mission just arrived in Damascus.The United Nations Security Council on the same day held an emergency meeting over the missile attacks at Russia's request, but failed to approve a resolution condemning the bombardment.On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Ruhani condemned the airstrikes over phone, agreeing that the \"illegal action seriously damages the prospects for a political settlement\" in the war-torn country, according to a Kremlin statement.\"Putin in particular stressed that if such actions, carried out in violation of the UN Charter, continue, it will inevitably lead to chaos in international relations,\" the statement said.Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said he was ready to talk to all, including Russia and Iran, to pave the way for inclusive political transition in the war-torn Syria.\"I say it from the beginning, to build lasting peace, one needs to dialogue with Iran, Russia and Turkey. France's policy is to talk with everyone. It's the condition to have peace,\" Macron told French news outlets on Sunday.The just-concluded yearly Arab League (AL) Summit on Sunday reiterated that political solution is the only path for Syria to realize peace. Only eliminating terrorist groups and cutting off world powers' meddling could create chance for Syrian people to build an independent Syria.The AL, at the summit held in eastern Saudi city of Dhahran, also denounced the use of chemical weapons in any place, requiring an international investigation in accordance with international regulations into any such case.At the meeting, Jordanian King Abdullah II said the Syrian crisis should be resolved through political negotiation other than any military action which could escalate regional conflicts.In this regard, the Astana talks only involving Russia, Iran and Turkey, which was brokered last year for a political settlement of the Syrian conflict, cannot replace the UN-backed Geneva talks which have more global parties, he added.Also at the meeting, the Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah regretted that double standard was applied in the Syrian issue, saying Kuwait will not hesitate to offer humanitarian aid to east the agony of Syrian people.The African Union (AU) Commission on Sunday called on world powers to undertake international efforts to find lasting solutions to the Syrian civil war that respect the country's territorial integrity and serves the interests of Syrian people.In a press statement, it said \"Africa expects the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members, especially those that are permanent, to put aside their differences and spare no efforts in the pursuit of global peace and humanity's common good, in line with the responsibilities conferred upon them by the United Nations Charter.\"It further said \"any response\" to the alleged poison gas attack \"ought to be based on incontrovertible evidence gathered by a competent, independent and credible entity and comply strictly with international law, including the primacy of the UNSC for any recourse to force.\" China Focus: Hainan to take on bigger roles in reform, opening-upXi underscores reform, opening-up, environmental protection in \nHainan\n\"Chinese Bridge\" language competition for Swedish students held in StockholmPeople take part in anti-war protest in New YorkTea fields in C China's Wufeng enter into spring harvest seasonTourists go sightseeing on cantilever bridge in Chongqing, SW ChinaWater-sprinkling festival held in Yunnan to pray for good fortuneTourists enjoy azalea flowers in east China","url":"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/16/c_137114715.htm","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:40:14.464Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Accusing al-Assad of carrying out state terrorism in the war, Erdogan said the Syrian leader should not be allowed to remain in power.\"The deeper problem is that the Turkish government still lacks a consistent, steady Syria policy of its own,\" said Logoglu. \"It vacillates between Russia and the U.S., between its commitment to Syria's territorial integrity and its wish to exercise long-term control through proxies over parts of Syria.\"Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem accused Ankara last month of having designs on Syria's territory, while Damascus sees the presence of Turkish troops on Syrian soil as occupation.The \"al-Assad must go\" attitude assumed by the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey is in line with the U.S. position, though Ankara says \"no\" to Washington's military support to the Kurdish militia in Syria.Arguing Turkey's vacillating policy in Syria has worked to its detriment, Logoglu said, \"Turkey's policy should be to support a single Syria, with one flag, one army. Otherwise, Turkey is likely to face further isolation regarding Syria.\" Xi stresses real combat trainingSnowfall seen in parts of ChinaNew York City to install 1,500 security barriersAt least 9 injured in storm Eleanor in ParisPLA takes over flag-raising duty at Tian'anmen Square on New Year's DayMajor work of world's longest sea bridge completedIntangible cultural heritage exhibition held in Puyuan, east ChinaInternational ice sculpture competition held in NE China's Harbin","url":"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/04/c_136871970.htm","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:40:23.420Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Yahya Suleiman, an expert in the strategic military fields, told Xinhua that as early as the second half of 2017, a strategic decision was made that any Israeli attacks will be retaliated instantly.\"The Israelis have only admitted the targeting of one warplane but the truth is that many warplanes were hit during today's confrontation,\" he said.Suleiman, however, said he doesn't think the situation will escalate toward a full-fledged war, citing the internal crisis of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who could face trial on corruption charges.Additionally, Israel knows that Syria or Hezbollah will not be alone in any confrontation because the \"Axis of Resistance,\" which includes Iran, Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah, will unite in facing any Israeli threat to any part of the axis, the Syrian general noted.Israel itself doesn't seem ready to escalate the situation.An Israeli military spokesman said on Saturday that his country does not seek an escalation in the region.\"We are willing, prepared and capable to exact a heavy price from anyone that attacks us.

Discover the Spectacular Labuan BajoAYANA Komodo Resort","content":"The shadow of war that has fallen over Syria is darkening with US President Donald Trump raising his pitch with each passing day and threatening “missiles will be coming” in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack on Saturday.At least 60 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in the suspected chemical weapons attack on Syria’s last rebel-controlled area on Saturday, but before there is even an international investigation into the attack to determine what happened and who is to blame, a knee-jerk reaction like the one Trump is threatening will only further complicate the situation and create a greater humanitarian disaster in the war-torn country.That the United Nations Security Council failed to approve three draft resolutions on setting up an international investigation into the attack on Tuesday shows Washington and Moscow, the two belligerent parties over the issue, need to narrow their differences.After all, paralyzing the world body does not help international efforts to diagnose and address the grave situation in Syria.The Syrian people have surely suffered enough after seven years of conflict. Yet even after the Islamic State extremists were defeated in the country, the fighting between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russia, and the rebels, supported by the US, has continued.A hasty military strike against the Assad regime would increase the possibility of what has been a shadow clash between Washington and Moscow turning into a head-on confrontation.The two countries should try harder to avoid such a scenario from coming true because it will further aggravate the situation in Syria and only create fertile ground for extremist organizations. And combating terrorists was the professed reason the two countries became involved in the Syrian civil war.The US leader should, in particular, restrain his penchant for warmongering rhetoric, especially since his country’s military action in neighboring Iraq is responsible for having sparked the current chaos in the Middle East. And in recent years, other countries in the region besides Syria have become mired in conflict and social instability because of the US’ interventionist policy.Experience shows diplomacy is still the best option for defusing a crisis such as the one in Syria. The United States should think twice before plunging the region deeper into bloodshed and conflict, and take a step back to reappraise its policy toward the Middle East.\nEnglish|中文\n","url":"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201804/12/WS5acf537da3105cdcf6517ecd.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:40:51.631Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Why did the US and its allies not wait until the investigation yields a result?It reminds us of what happened to Iraq in 2003 when the United States invaded the country claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were found, and the war led to the protracted turmoil in Iraq and the rise of the Islamic State group. For that war, the United States and its allies owe the Iraqi people and the world an apology.It is Syria this time, a country that entered its eighth year of war in March. Nothing is more urgent than political stability and national reconciliation for this country. At the time when the Syrian government forces have gained the upper hand in the civil war, there seems no reason for it to use chemical weapons to provoke the United States and its allies, which have long been considering the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.Given the complexity of the situation in Syria, the military strikes will only make it even more difficult for the parties involved to work out a peaceful solution and for the country to emerge from war.The arbitrary and abrupt military action by the United States and its allies will likely complicate the possibility of political solutions to the settlement of other hotspot issues. Its spillover effects will have an impact on the denuclearization process on the Korean Peninsula, in which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will have reason to consider the possession of nuclear weapons as the sole guarantee for it to avert such military strikes by the United States and its allies.It is a pity that the Security Council of the United Nations on Saturday failed to adopt a resolution to condemn the airstrikes. But history may prove them as wrong just as it has the US' military impulsiveness in Iraq.\nEnglish|中文\n","url":"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201804/16/WS5ad3d578a3105cdcf651858e.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:41:09.120Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

A cold calculation seems to be taking hold: that little can be done except to arm the parties and watch the conflict rage. The international community must not abandon the people of Syria and the region to never-ending waves of cruelty and crisis.The death toll may now be well over 150,000. Prisons and makeshift detention facilities are swelling with men, women and even children. Deaths by summary executions and unspeakable torture are widespread. People are also dying from hunger and once rare infectious diseases. Whole urban centers and some of humankind's great architectural and cultural heritage lie in ruins. Syria today is increasingly a failed state.The United Nations has tried hard to address the conflict's deep roots and devastating impact. Our humanitarian and other efforts are saving lives and reducing suffering. But our fundamental objective - an end to the conflict - remains unmet. The bleak prospects for peace have darkened further with the flare-up of violence and sectarian tensions in Iraq. The cohesion and integrity of two major countries, not just one, is in question.The following six points can chart a principled and integrated way forward.First, ending the violence. It is irresponsible for foreign powers to give continued military support to parties in Syria that are committing atrocities and flagrantly violating fundamental principles of human rights and international law. I have urged the Security Council to impose an arms embargo. The sides will have to sit across from each other again at the negotiating table. How many more people must die before they get there?Second, protecting people. The UN continues to manage a huge humanitarian relief effort. But the government continues to impose unconscionable access restrictions; it has removed medical supplies from aid convoys and deliberately starved and collectively punished communities it regards as sympathetic to the opposition. Some rebel groups have acted similarly. Moreover, the international community has provided barely a third of the funding needed for the relief effort. I continue to appeal for an end to the sieges and for unfettered humanitarian access across internal frontlines and international borders.Third, starting a serious political process. The warring parties systematically blocked the relentless initiatives of two of the world's leading diplomats, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and former UN and Arab League special envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi. The presidential election earlier this month was a further blow, and failed to meet even minimal standards for credible voting. I will soon name a new special envoy to Syria to pursue a political solution and a transition to a new Syria. Regional countries have a special responsibility to help end this war. I welcome recent contacts between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hope that they will build confidence and reverse a destructive competition in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere. Syrian civil society groups are making courageous efforts to maintain the fabric of society and keep open channels of solidarity and communication.\nI've been thinking about writing an article to summarize my life in the past year, 2014, and I saw the topic popping out yesterday.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss closed-door deliberations.\nA Jordanian soldier gives food and water to Syrian children refugees after they crossed the border from Syria, near Mafraq Feb 18, 2013. [Photo/Agencies]That view was bolstered by a new report on Monday by a UN-appointed panel that said Syria's civil war is becoming increasingly sectarian and the behavior of both sides is growing more and more radicalized. The report urged the international community to curb the supply of weapons, and anti-government forces to part with foreign fighters.Several foreign ministers said they were placing their hopes on the mediation efforts of Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint UN-Arab League envoy to Syria.\"There is no shortage of arms in Syria,\" Luxembourgish Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said. \"With more arms, there are more killed, more atrocities.\"The UN says nearly 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict since March 2011.\"We are convinced that a lifting of the weapons embargo would not be reasonable,\" said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. \"This would only lead to a new arms race in Syria. This would mean a further escalation of violence with many, many more victims.\"The British Foreign and Commonwealth office said in a statement that its objective remains a diplomatic solution. But the statement did not explicitly confirm or deny that the UK wanted the embargo altered to get arms to the rebels.\"The UK believes international action so far has fallen short,\" it said. \"In the absence of a diplomatic breakthrough, it is right that we continue to consider all options to protect civilians and to assist the National Coalition and other opposition groups opposed to extremism.\"Despite the violence, diplomatic efforts continue. Mouaz al-Khatib, the president of the opposition coalition, has said he would negotiate with representatives of Syria's governing party - though not with Assad or members of his security services. Brahimi, the international envoy, says that offer \"challenges the Syrian government to fulfill its often repeated assertion that it is ready for dialogue and a peaceful settlement\". The report released in Geneva on Monday by the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria made for alarming reading.The commission, set up by the UN Human Rights Council, hasn't been able to enter the country and said that \"significantly limited\" its ability to investigate all alleged abuses - particularly those committed by armed anti-government groups. The report was based on 445 interviews with victims and witnesses.\"The war has become colored by sectarianism, permeated by opportunistic criminality and aggravated by the presence of foreign fighters and extremist groups,\" the panel said.It said the number of foreigners fighting in the conflict has increased but still accounts for \"a small proportion\" of anti-government groups - though it remains hard to assess with accuracy their numbers.It added that foreign fighters appear to come from countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, \"many from Libya, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt\". It urged anti-Assad groups to \"detach themselves from the foreign fighters, particularly extreme elements that fail to comply with international human rights and humanitarian law\".The commission also found that the civil war \"is becoming more militarized because of the proliferation of weapons and types of weapons used\", with arms and ammunition smuggled across Syria's borders to anti-government groups on an increasingly regular basis.It said government forces have increasingly used cluster munitions, but there was \"no credible evidence\" of either side using chemical weapons.The panel also said it will submit a new, confidential list of Syrians suspected of committing crimes against humanity in the country's civil war to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, next month. ","url":"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2013-02/19/content_16235353.htm","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:41:36.677Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Alptekin Hocaoglu arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a four-day visit.He was quoted in a Foreign Ministry press statement saying that his coalition is ready to participate in the UN-led dialogue without any precondition, and advocate that the Syria government and oppositions should take measures to build trust gradually, and solve all problems through dialogue and negotiation.He said he hopes China will play a bigger role in pushing for the political solution of the Syrian issue.China has actively participated in international mediations to draw opposition parties in Syria to the negotiating table ever since the civil war broke out five years ago.China announced that it would extend an additional 40 million yuan ($6.06 million) in humanitarian aid to Syria while hosting visiting Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, who arrived in December.Wang Mingming, a researcher of the Institute of World Economics and Politics under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the efforts China has been making to bring a negotiation shows the country is playing a more constructive role in addressing Middle East Issues than before. Both the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition parties believe that China has a \"relatively equitable\" stance in the Syrian issue due to its \"detached\" position. Wang said, adding that he is optimistic that China will help address the issue.Former Chinese special envoy on the Middle East issues Wu Sike said the willingness to negotiate between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition parties shows that the international community has realized military measures cannot solve problems, and the most urgent issue now is to work together to fight terrorism.\"China has long been expressing its stance of addressing the Syrian issue through political solutions, and its effort to talk it through to both the Syrian government and opposition parties has paid off,\" Wu said.

The US, British and French air strikes on three Syrian sites on April 14, claiming they are associated with the Syrian government forces' alleged chemical attack in Douma in eastern Ghouta, was without any justification of international law or authorization of the UN Security Council. The West has done it before, in Iraq and Libya for instance, and may do it again.In the case of Iraq, the West's claim that Saddam Hussein possessed \"weapons of mass destruction\" was at best, totally false or at worst, beautifully fabricated. In Libya's case, the West managed to convince Russia and China that its mission was to supply \"humanitarian aid\" to the people of Libya so the two countries abstained from a Security Council resolution on a \"no fly zone\".But Moscow and Beijing were soon shocked to see the West launch a NATO mission to overthrow the Muammar Gadhafi regime.In the latest attack on Syria, the Western powers were cautious enough not to hit any Russian or Iranian military sites there to avoid a direct retaliation by Moscow. But by carrying the attack in the first place, the West ignored prior warnings by Russia that it would respond in kind if its military sites were attacked.This signifies a disturbing Western strategic trend which, if allowed to continue, could spark what many fear could be \"World War III\".In fact, with US President Donald Trump now insisting on \"renegotiating\" the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987 to eliminate all nuclear and conventional missiles with ranges of 500-1,000 kilometers and 1,000-5,500 km, and Moscow saying it will abide by the treaty as long as Washington continues do the same, fears of a post-Cold War nuclear arms race seem increasingly real, in which a political clash or an accidental targeting error, as Richard Falk, professor emeritus of International Law at Princeton University, put it, could cause a catastrophic humanitarian and geopolitical crisis.Or, did the three Western powers launch the strikes on Syria to turn the attention of their people from more important and immediate domestic issues? Trump's presidential approval rating is at one of its lowest, he is locked in a difficult trade dispute with China and his popularity among even US allies is very low. Britain is facing problems on many fronts, the foremost being Brexit. And France has been tackling one domestic crisis after another, from terrorist attacks to labor reforms and farmers' subsidies.That the West carried out the strikes without any evidence that Bashar al-Assad had indeed ordered the so-called chemical attacks, and that too at a time when he seems to be winning the civil war against the rebels, tells another story. Some even claim the rushed attack was, in fact, launched to eliminate any evidence that the rebels or other terrorist outfits, not the Syrian government, was involved in the chemical attack especially because the Organization for the Protection of Chemical Weapons is yet to start its fact-finding mission into the Douma incident.Given its apparent attempt to prevent the Assad government from eliminating the remaining Islamic terrorists in Syria, the West's tall claims of fighting global terrorism for the global common good ring hollow. Western powers have not learned any lesson from the destruction of Iraq, or their failure in Afghanistan to root out terrorists.Perhaps they believe they stand to gain more economically and politically if the civil wars continue in the Middle East countries. Call it the politics of \"creative destruction\", if you will. It's comforting to know therefore that there are still some countries that do not say one thing, and do exactly the opposite.But as the world continues to play its political and strategic games, more sufferings pile up on the Syrian people.The author is a senior editor with China Daily.\nEnglish|中文\n","url":"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201804/19/WS5ad7db3ca3105cdcf6519242.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T15:43:52.261Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

[Photo/Agencies]\nRussia, China veto draft UN resolution on Syrian civil warThe unadopted draft resolution, proposed by France, received 13 votes in favor and two against.\"The draft resolution has not been adopted owing to the negative votes of permanent members of the council,\" said Oh Joon, the South Korean permanent representative to the United Nations, who holds the rotating council presidency for the month of May.The Thursday vote at the 15-nation UN body made it a fourth double veto by Russia and China on a West-drafted resolution on Syria.Syria is not a state party to the Rome Statute which established the ICC, so the only way the Middle East country can be referred to The Hague-based tribunal is by the Security Council.Under the UN Charter, the adoption of a draft resolution requires nine votes in favor and the absence of a negative vote by any of the five permanent members of the Security Council.France, another permanent council member, circulated the draft resolution among the council members on May 12 in a bid to refer the Syrian civil war, current in its fourth year, to the ICC for review of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\"The Security Council reaffirms its strong condemnation of the widespread violations of human rights law by the Syrian authorities and pro-government militias, as well as the human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by non-State armed groups, all committed in the course of the ongoing conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011,\" said the draft resolution.After the council vote, Vitaly Churkin, the Russian UN ambassador, said at the Security Council that the vetoed draft resolution, if adopted, would \"lay the ground for the eventual outside military intervention\" in Syria.Churkin blamed France, which initiated the draft resolution, for trying once again to \"create a pretext for armed intervention in the Syrian conflict,\" while \"fully aware of the failure it will meet\" in the wake of the council vote.\"It is striking that there is not a single word on the political settlement and the negotiation process among the Syrians \" mentioned in a communique at the end of the May 15 meeting on Syria in London, he said.Citing the case of Libya, Churkin said the referral to the ICC would not help resolve the crisis.The Security Council has previously referred Libya and Sudan's Darfur to the ICC.\"We call on our Western colleagues to abandon the futile, dead-end policy on Syria,\" he said.\"We share their emotions caused by the crisis in Syria, which has been dragging on for far too long,\" Churkin said, referring to the countries sponsoring the draft resolutions.Russia has already voiced its opposition to the referral of Syria to the ICC. On Wednesday, Churkin called a \"public stunt\" the planned council vote.The Geneva communique, issued in June 2012 on the principles of accountability and national reconciliation in Syria, will continue to serve as the basis for \"the core efforts\" to strive for the political solution to the Syrian crisis, he said. \"We are convinced that the justice in Syria will eventually prevail.\"\"Those guilty of perpetrating grave crimes will be punished,\" he said. \"But in order for this to happen, peace is first needed, first and foremost.\"\nThe quest to find, lure and keep talent goes on and onAfter 145 years, Chinese railroad workers honored at lastCipher this: Chinese novel explores cryptography's labyrinthLearning to warm up to and love China, with a claw-hammer banjo on her kneeTerritorial disputes in the South China SeaPremier Li visits African countriesRoyals who have visited ChinaCopyright 1995 - \n\n\n\u003c!--\nvar oTime = new Date();\ndocument.write(oTime.getFullYear());\n--\u003e\n2018\n\n .

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77ce794719c855216573ab"},"header":"Israel Lost in Syria, But It's Ready With Another War Crime: Yemen","time":"Tue, Jun 19, 2018","content":"\"Iran is too formidable a foe to move against just yet and especially after the humiliating defeat in Syria.\"For those of you unfamiliar with the Greater Israel project (Oded-Yinon plan), it aims to extend Israel’s borders from Egypt to Iran. How? By waging war? No, it is far more insidious.Take a look at the last 25 years and the wars that the USA has fought to \"bring democracy\" or \"regime change\", and a simple pattern emerges.The ruling party, if against Israel, is making progress in a country free from the influence of Jewish central banks. Israel convinces the US and it’s gullible allies that this prospering country is ruled by an evil government hell-bent on manufacturing chemical or nuclear weapons etc. Sanctions follow, after which the government of the targeted country agrees to destroy its defensive capabilities based on assurances that sanctions will be lifted and the government will be treated fairly.You can see where this is going... once the weapons are destroyed, Israel convinces its allies using Jewish owned media in the West, that the regime that trusted them is cruel and needs to be changed on \"humanitarian grounds\", thus an internal civil war is sparked or a false flag is staged attacking the US or its allies, orchestrated by Israel and blamed as the scapegoat of the day.Does this sound unbelievable? Let’s take a look at the regimes that have been changed under this pretext, Egypt, Libya, Iraq. All of them had a few things in common: the means to defend themselves against Israel, freedom from Jewish-owned banking, and stable governments making progress in their countries.All of them were disarmed with promises of support, after which they were overthrown by instigating and funding civil war, and where civil war was impossible, simply attacked.Those who trusted the US and its allies were deposed and sometimes executed in public (e.g. Moammar Gaddafi, who was making Libya an advanced state with free healthcare, education and warned of the current \"refugee crisis\" if Libya was destabilized).Once the government was disarmed and then deposed and it’s leaders executed, a Jewish controlled central bank was quickly established and the gold reserves flown out of them. Case in point, the Ukrainian civil war: the moment they got control of part of Ukraine that Russia did not reclaim, they established a central bank and flew out the gold reserves under cover of darkness (a quick google search will verify this).Now, if you look at the map of the Middle East you see the influence and borders of Israel growing, always following this same plan, Syria was the next target, demonize Assad, instigate civil war, frame it as a \"humanitarian emergency\" and fund the breakup of a stable country to strengthen Israel.BUT! never do it directly but through funding and arming \"freedom fighters\" and making your allies defend \"the poor children\" etc etc. Russia finally stepped in after seeing the debacle and brazen stupidity and repeat of the Iraq, Egypt strategy in Libya. With president Trump reluctant to fight Israeli wars, finally Israel had to (gasp!) come to the forefront and attack Syria under the guise of attacking Iran. At the time of writing this article Israel has bombed Syria 100+ times just in 2017. Next up is Iran. But their insidious warfare plans have been thwarted by a smart Russia. Itself having suffered under Jewish torture and extermination of some 50 million Christians by the Bolsheviks in the Holodomor.Now Israel is seething and planning all kinds of false flags to get the US and the UK and France to be good little lapdogs and save the \"poor Syrians\" while quietly exporting most of the internal Syrian terrorists to Sweden and Europe.But wait! there’s more! Just because Israel lost Syria doesn’t mean they'll back off. Israelis and Jews are not that simple.Israel has been funding a proxy war in Yemen as well. The typical Israeli strategy is straight out of the Communist Manifesto, constant war, forever, fought by others. So now in Yemen they have an image issue. The Yemeni government is fully under Israeli control and the \"rebels\" are the nationalists trying to take their nation back. In Syria, Israel argued that the rebels were good people totally not financed by Israel, the US and Mossad-Pentagon. The Syria debacle ended up costing the US about $1 trillion.No problem, says the think tank in Tel Aviv. We’ll just frame the Houthi rebel’s as \"terrorists\" and the Yemen government as under siege. No one will notice this flip-flop. Don’t believe it? Just go to google and type Yemen and see how they have framed this conflict.And, notice another thing, Israel is not in the picture, it’s making Saudi Arabia fight this war.If you want to see where the next flashpoint is, after Syria, look to Yemen. Iran is too formidable a foe to move against just yet and especially after the humiliating defeat in Syria.A million more words could be written about this, but this is just a primer to make you realize how Israel sets up its own empire not directly but by attacking its friends, blaming the attack on the countries Israel wants to destroy, making their friends fight Israeli wars and then helping things by instigating civil war inside these nations.Once you understand this simple formula, the next time you see a headline shrieking about \"humanitarian crisis in anti-Israel-land\" you will know exactly what is going on, who is funding it and most importantly, the question that answers all...cui bono? This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone. - Rod Serling The Twilight Zone is also where the president of Turkey lives, or at least one would think so.In an absolutely outrageous scene, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan actually blamed Russia - publicly - for the deaths of up to 400,000 people in Syria over the course of the last five years.This amazing statement comes from a man who more than any other party on earth is directly responsible for the ISIS horror show that has tormented, defiled, and butchered a once-peaceful nation to further his own insidious 'Neo-Ottoman' objectives.While visiting his counterpart in Senegal this week, and ostensibly with a straight face, the Turkish tyrant stated that, ' Russia must be held accountable for the people it has killed within Syria's borders. By cooperatiing with the regime, the number of people they have killed has reached 400,000.'Erdogan for some reason forgot to mention that he was directly responsible for facilitating the flow of ISIS terrorists into Syria from countries all over the world and arming them to the teeth in order to wage an unholy war on a peaceful neighbor whose greatest crime against him was a desire to be his friend.He also forgot to mention that he was directly responsible for committing the heinous war crime of gassing Syrian civilians in order to manipulate Obama's idiotic 'red line' remarks about the use of chemical weapons.  He also forgot to mention how his son was directly responsible for running a smuggling operation that transported hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars of stolen Syrian oil that he sold to the Israelis and which served as the main source of funding for the greatest terror group in world history.He also forgot to mention how his daughter was directly responsible for operating a secret ISIS hospital on the Turkish side of the border where terrorists would go to heal their wounds, rest up, and return back to resume their slaughter of the Syrian people.Erdogan was also directly responsible for providing shelter and a free zone of operation on his territory for the 'Free Syrian Army' back in 2011. And it was Istanbul where he hosted the 'opposition' in order to plan its war against the Syrian people and its legitimate government. Erdogan also offered his territory to serve as the conduit through which a large portion of Gaddafi's arsenal (after he was lynched) was funneled into Syria eventually ending up in the hands of the al-Qaeda-linked terrorists in Syria - the so-called 'rat line' (which incidentally led to the murder of US ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi).All of this is to say nothing of the mass exodus of 'refugees' which he is directly responsible for (God only knows how many of whom are sadistic terrorists fleeing a lost cause) who are currently assaulting and raping their way around Europe, and of whom a cell has already perpetrated a mass killing in France.But President Erdogan - a man absolutely and indisputably guilty of mass murder, rape, pillage, plunder, torture, and enslavement on an epic scale - stands as shameless as ever. Worse still, he somehow manages to muster enough temerity to get in front of the cameras and tell the world that not only are his crimes not his fault; but rather, they are the fault of the very man who intervened to stop them.What can one say about such madness? What can one say about, or even to, a man who lies in such a nakedly-offensive and sickening manner? I myself can think of only one thing.President Erdogan:  This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Answer: Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama spearheaded this push.Hillary Clinton in particular displayed sociopathic and murderous intent as she spoke about threatening Assads family with death.Check out some of these amazing excerpts from her official emails:The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad. Negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear program will not solve Israel's security dilemma. Nor will they stop Iran from improving the crucial part of any nuclear weapons program — the capability to enrich uranium. At best, the talks between the world's major powers and Iran that began in Istanbul this April and will continue in Baghdad in May will enable Israel to postpone by a few months a decision whether to launch an attack on Iran that could provoke a major Mideast war.What does politics in Syria have to do with nuclear weapons?Iran's nuclear program and Syria's civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. For Israeli leaders, the real threat from a nuclear-armed Iran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader launching an unprovoked Iranian nuclear attack on Israel that would lead to the annihilation of both countries. What Israeli military leaders really worry about -- but cannot talk about -- is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.When have similar American actions interfered with political sovereignty in the Near-East and similar countries? What makes Syria different?The Obama administration has been understandably wary of engaging in an air operation in Syria like the one conducted in Libya for three main reasons. Unlike the Libyan opposition forces, the Syrian rebels are not unified and do not hold territory. The Arab League has not called for outside military intervention as it did in Libya. And the Russians are opposed. Libya was an easier case. But other than the laudable purpose of saving Libyan civilians from likely attacks by Qaddafi's regime, the Libyan operation had no long-lasting consequences for the region. Syria is harder. But success in Syria would be a transformative event for the Middle East. Not only would another ruthless dictator succumb to mass opposition on the streets, but the region would be changed for the better as Iran would no longer have a foothold in the Middle East from which to threaten Israel and undermine stability in the region. Unlike in Libya, a successful intervention in Syria would require substantial diplomatic and military leadership from the United States. Washington should start by expressing its willingness to work with regional allies like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar to organize, train and arm Syrian rebel forces. The announcement of such a decision would, by itself, likely cause substantial defections from the Syrian military. Then, using territory in Turkey and possibly Jordan, U.S. diplomats and Pentagon officials can start strengthening the opposition. It will take time. But the rebellion is going to go on for a long time, with or without U.S. involvement. The second step is to develop international support for a coalition air operation.What were the American leaders view of Russia and the possibility of conflict with Russia?Russia will never support such a mission, so there is no point operating through the UN Security Council. Some argue that U.S. involvement risks a wider war with Russia. But the Kosovo example shows otherwise. In that case, Russia had genuine ethnic and political ties to the Serbs, which don't exist between Russia and Syria, and even then Russia did little more than complain. Russian officials have already acknowledged they won't stand in the way if intervention comes.Where are Syria's connections geopolitically with Iran, and why are these connections this viewed as a problem? Back to Syria. It is the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's security — not through a direct attack, which in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel has never occurred, but through its proxies in Lebanon, like Hezbollah, that are sustained, armed and trained by Iran via Syria.Why would the fall of the Assad regime benefit Israel? Why is Syria so significant?The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel's leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Speaking on CNN's Amanpour show last week, Defense Minister Ehud Barak argued that \"the toppling down of Assad will be a major blow to the radical axis, major blow to Iran.... It's the only kind of outpost of the Iranian influence in the Arab world...and it will weaken dramatically both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.\" Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel's security, it would also ease Israel's understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.These emails effectively prove that the American government intentionally supported the \"moderate rebels\" (such as ISIS) in the disastrous Syrian civil war because they viewed it as the best way to protect Israeli interests. Hundreds of thousands were killed by the conflict, and millions were displaced, all of this fueled by American imperialists serving Israeli interests.Wikileaks sourceThis post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Of course they don't really know that, they're making it up.\"This is a big deal and a strong signal aimed at Trump as he mulls an attack on Syria. If he does it, he will face devastating criticism from his base.Interesting that Carlson doesn't mention the most obvious reason not to attack Syria, - the fact that Russia has said that it will definitely respond, i.e., attack US forces in response, starting a hot war between them that could very likely turn into WW3 very quickly.Full Transcript:Tonight leaders on both sides of the aisle in Congress, in the media, in our intelligence services, and in virtually every over-funded think tank in Washington, have suddenly aligned tonight on a single point of agreement: America must go to war in Syria, immediately! Bashar al Assad cannot continue to lead that country, he must be overthrown!Assad is an evil man they tell us. His latest crime is a chlorine gas attack carried out over the weekend by his forces against a rebel-held suburb of Damascus. Assad's poison gas suffocated children. Pictures of the aftermath of that are all over the internet and they are horrifying. Assad is a monster - that's the official story. Almost everyone in power claims to believe it.The push to war in Syria, by the way, has united politicians from both sides. Lindsey Graham and Howard Dean typically agree on very little, but today they are both calling for war in Syria. Graham is demanding massive attacks on the Syrian military. Dean is going even further than that. On Twitter he called the president \"a wimp\" for merely sending thousands of troops and launching tons of bombs at Syria. That's not enough for Howard Dean, who was you may remember once ran for president as the peace candidate. Tonight he wants total war in Syria.Television pundits of course strongly agree. This morning the foreign policy team over at MSNBC explained that it's far more important for American troops to fight in Syria than it is to secure our own border here in America. Watch: (Clip of Andrea Mitchell, Mika Brzezinski, and Joe Scarborough calling for war). Trump has to take action in Syria everyone nods sagely.That ought to make you nervous.Universal bipartisan agreement on anything is usually the first sign that something deeply unwise is about to happen if only because there is nobody left to ask skeptical questions. And we should be skeptical of this, starting with the poison gas attack itself.All the geniuses tell us that Assad killed those children, but do they really know that? Of course they don't really know that, they're making it up. They have no real idea what happened.Actually both sides in the Syrian civil war possess chemical weapons. How would it benefit Assad using chlorine gas last weekend? Well it wouldn't. Assad's forces had been winning the war in Syria. The administration just announced its plans to pull American troops out of Syria having vanquished ISIS. That's good news for Assad. About the only thing he could do to reverse it and to hurt himself would be to use poison gas against children. Well he did it anyway they tell us. He's that evil!Please keep in mind this is the same story they told us last April. Do you remember that it was almost exactly a year ago that the new administration announced it was no longer seeking to depose Assad from power? Regime change was no longer our policy.The usual War chorus in Washington started yelping and went berserk and days later Assad supposedly used sarin gas against civilians in Syria! There was video!  We bombed a Syrian air base in response.At the time, this show asked what seemed like the obvious question: are we really sure that Assad did that? It seems weirdly timed and counterproductive to him.  - Shut up, they explained, of course we're sure! What an unpatriotic question! But of course they were lying.Two months ago the Secretary of Defense admitted that actually we still have no proof that Assad used sarin gas last year. The story, it turns out, was propaganda, designed to manipulate Americans, just like so much of what they say. We've seen this movie before and we know how it ends.Just for the sake of argument let's assume they're not lying this time. Let's assume Assad did just use chlorine gas against kids. He's perfectly capable of that, by the way, I'm not defending his moral character. Let's say he did do it. Would that be worth starting a new war?Overthrowing Assad's regime in Syria would result in chaos. Many thousands would die. In fact we might likely see the genocide of one of the last remaining Christian communities in the Middle East and we ought to care about that. Some of the dead of course would be American servicemen. A new war would cost us tens of billions of dollars, maybe hundreds of billions. Would it make America safer? Would it make the region more stable? Let's see, how exactly did regime change work in Iraq and Libya?That doesn't matter!, say our moral leaders on CNN and everywhere else. Atrocities like this cannot be tolerated!OK, but let's be real - we do tolerate atrocities like this all the time, for example, there's a devastating famine killing children in Yemen right now. The Saudis are causing that famine. Should we drop tomahawks on Riyadh in response?Not until it's on YouTube apparently.When you conduct foreign policy by viral video, pictures are essential, but in real life, Syria is a highly complicated place. With Assad gone who would run it exactly? Do we have another strongman in place to install or is it our hope that a stable democracy will magically appear in the wake of this protracted civil war?And who exactly are these moderate rebels you're always hearing about?, the ones that we're supporting with your tax dollars? Well a lot of them turn out to be Islamist crazies. For example the city where the chemical attack just occurred is mostly controlled by the Army of Islam, a radical group that has called for establishing an Islamic state under Sharia law in Syria. That group's founder called for exterminating all Shia Muslims and Alawites from the country but we're supposed to wage a new war on this groups behalf! Why is it that exactly?Back in 2013 when the Syrian civil war was still in its early days one onlooker weighed-in on Twitter. Here's part of what he wrote:\"we should stay the hell out of Syria,  the rebels are just as bad as the current regime, what will we get for our lives and billions of dollars?: Zero!\"In another tweet he said this:\"Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?\"And in yet another tweet he said this:\"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long-term conflict?!\"Of course you know who wrote that. It was Donald Trump, and he was right, and that's one of the reasons he got elected president.Now the same people who brought you a dying American middle class, un-defended American borders and endless pointless wars in countries you could not find out a map, are telling the president he's got to depose Assad for reasons that are both unclear and demonstrably dishonest.  And by the way - it may happen.Before it does Congress ought to consider a brand-new constitutional amendment.  Let's call it the Lindsey Graham Amendment. Here's what it would say:\"Congress shall topple no government until it finishes re-building the last government it toppled and furthermore talk show generals shall be required to personally visit the battlefield of every war they advocate for.\"That would have an immediate and positive effect!Let's hope it passes.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Syrians seeking refuge in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are also looking for ways to travel to the West. They lose their lives, their families, all their material assets on the road to West. During the Syrian civil war, Armenia, one of the poorest countries in the world with 3 million inhabitants, opened its doors to Syrian refugees without any hesitation.Compared to its own population, Armenia has the third largest number of Syrian refugees. In Armenia, where 17 thousand Syrian refugees live, there are 6 refugees in 1000 persons. The Syrians, who remind the Armenian people of their tragic history, are welcomed with sincerity in Armenia.With limited financial resources, the Armenian government has provided extensive assistance to refugees. In addition to free medical services, children of Syrian refugees can continue their educational life in Armenian schools. Within the \"Adopt a Family\" project, every Syrian family is trying to adapt to the social and cultural life of Armenia with the help of an Armenian family. Micro-scale initial loans are provided to help refugees adjust to Armenia by starting a new life.With a GDP of 1% of the EU countries and a unemployment rate of 17%, Armenia has received no support from foreign countries and international organizations for the efforts it has made to assist refugees. The Armenian diaspora NGOs in the United States have been able to raise $ 1.2 million so far with aid campaigns they have organized this year. Armenia continues to make efforts to ease the lives of Syrian refugees despite all the difficulties.Serhan Kayir is Editor in Chief of Levant Times news website and an Ileri Haber Op-Ed columnist, expert in Middle East and Eurasia politics.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77cf024719c855216573b5"},"header":"How the West's Folly Brought Humiliation in Syria","time":"Sun, Oct 4, 2015","content":"The West's obsession with regime change triggered a civil war and the rise of the Islamic State, provoking a Russian reaction which threatens to leave the West sidelined and humiliatedThe West’s fury at the Russian air campaign in Syria is like the tantrum of a spoilt child denied its sweet.The sweet is the head of President Assad.US President Obama gave the game away in his first public comments following the Russian air strikes.Amidst many bitter words, he let the truth slip out:“The moderate opposition in Syria is one that, if we ever going to have a political transition, we need. And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are decapacitated and it is only strengthening ISIL.”Translated into plain English, Obama is complaining the Russian air campaign is destroying the people the US wants to take over Syria.This comment tells us something else.  This is that the US expects the Russian air campaign to succeed, and the opposition to Assad to be defeated.This very revealing article in the Daily Beast describes the hand-wringing in Washington as its bluff in Syria is being called.Behind the bluster, there is no intention to interfere in the Russian air campaign, and rather than face off against the Russian air force, plans for US bombing raids on Syria and for no-fly zones have been called off.Moreover there is a bipartisan support for this, with war hawks like Hillary Clinton and Senator McCain isolated.This is consistent with scattered reports that despite its public show of defiance the US has actually heeded the Russian warning to stay out of Syrian air space whilst the Russian air campaign is underway.That warning was made in an intentionally humiliating way, giving the US just an hour to comply, to rub in the point that the days when the US and its allies could roam freely in the skies of Syria are well and truly over.  Future overflights and bombing raids will henceforth have to be coordinated with the Russians, at least whilst the Russian air campaign is underway.Obama of course also complains in his comments that the Russian air campaign, by defeating the so-called “moderate” opposition to President Assad, is helping the Islamic State.This has become the main theme of Western media commentary over the last few days.The argument is - to quote Obama again - that“Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are decapacitated and it is only strengthening ISIL”.The people Obama is referring to - the \"folks\" who may be \"driven underground\" or \"decapacitated\" - are the people the US is supporting in the fight against President Assad.It is now universally admitted these people are overwhelmingly Sunni militants - in other words armed jihadis - violently opposed to what they see as an apostate secular Alawite led government in Syria. The idea that there can be a “moderate jihadi” opposition to President Assad - any more than there was a “moderate jihadi” opposition in Libya to  Muammar Gaddafi - is one that would strike most people as bizarre.  It is in fact an acknowledged fact that many of the “moderate jihadis” fighting President Assad - who the US is supporting - are affiliated to Al-Qaeda.To say this however is to underestimate the obsessive character of the US's Syrian policy.US policy is to overthrow President Assad.  The fact most of those fighing President Assad are militant jihadis is neither here nor there.  If “moderate” “liberal” “secular” Syrians cannot overthrow President Assad - and the lesson of the last four years is they cannot - then militant jihadis will have to do.The result is the absurd situation where the US is now running two covert programmes in Syria at the same time - one to create a jihadi army to fight President Assad; the other to create an army to fight the Islamic State, which also opposes President Assad, but which the US also says it opposes.The first programme - run by the CIA - has been a relative success.The second programme - run by the Pentagon - has despite the commitment of $500 million been a total failure.The reason the US has to have two programmes to create two different armies is because its first army - the jihadi army set up by the CIA to fight President Assad - won't fight the Islamic State.  As militant jihadis they have far too much in common with the Islamic State to be  prepared to fight it.This is why the Islamic State has managed to win so much territory at their expense in so short a time.  Since the US backed jihadis are only motivated to fight President Assad, and will not fight the Islamic State in any meaningful way, when the two come into conflict the US backed jihadis tend to defect to the Islamic State .The distinction the US therefore makes between a “moderate” armed opposition to President Assad and the Islamic State, has no meaningful ideological - and therefore political - reality.The only difference between the two groups is that the first - a militant jihadi group supported by the US - is focused on overthrowing President Assad, whilst the second - a militant jihadi group opposed by the US - is focused on expanding its territory.The victory of either group following the defeat of the Syrian government would however have the same result: the establishment of a violent sectarian jihadi state in Syria.  In practice, since the Islamic State is by far the better organised of the two groups attracting regular defections from the other group, its eventual victory would be all but certain.The key point - as Putin said in his UN speech - is that the only force in Syria that can be reliably trusted to fight the Islamic State is the Syrian army, together with its allies the Kurds and Hezbollah.To pretend otherwise is fantasy, denying the reality of the situation.What of repeated Western claims that the Syrian government is in some sort of implicit alliance with the Islamic State to weaken the anti-Assad opposition, and is not really fighting it?Putin has called this anti-Syrian propaganda and he is right.The problem is not that the Syrian army does not want to fight the Islamic State.  The problem is that the jihadi army the US has created insists on fighting the Syrian army rather than the Islamic State.Since the Syrian army has its hands full fighting the jihadi army the US has created, it cannot fight the Islamic State, especially since the Islamic State, taking advantage of the situation, has - quite deliberately - focused on expanding its territory at the expense of other jihadi groups, instead of fighting the Syrian army.If the objective is to defeat the Islamic State, then the Russian policy is the only one that makes sense. This is to help the Syrian army fight and defeat the Islamic State.  If that means destroying the US backed jihadis who are fighting the Syrian army, preventing the Syrian army from fighting the Islamic State, then the Russians have shown they will not balk from doing it.  They are right.  In the situation that exists in Syria now any other approach is not serious, and will end in failure. The only alternative is to do what the Russians have been calling for since the first protests in Syria began in 2011: arrange negotiations without preconditions between President Assad and his opponents.President Assad agreed to this in 2011, and a road map for such negotiations was agreed at a conference in Geneva in 2012.  The negotiations never got underway because the Syrian opposition backed by the US refused to negotiate with President Assad, demanding he resign instead.This is a demand that the Syrian government concede to the Syrian opposition the victory the Syrian opposition has failed to win on the battlefield, whilst making a precondition for the negotiations a possible outcome of the negotiations.That is ridiculous, and both the Russians and the Syrian government have repeatedly made clear they will never agree to it.Whenever the Russians and the Syrian government say no to this demand, which they always do, the Syrian opposition and the US invariably escalate, with a disastrous decision taken in the autumn of 2011 to go to war.It was that decision to go to war that set the scene for the present disaster.  That a decision to go to war was made at that time was clear to anyone who was following the situation closely.  Here is what I wrote in October 2011:“Notwithstanding the defeat the western powers on this occasion (have) suffered on the Security Council it would be naive to think that they have abandoned their plans.In the days just before the vote the western press suddenly filled up with stories about how the protesters having supposedly despaired of peaceful protest were now turning to violent insurrection.  I take this as a clear sign that arms shipments to the protesters (or perhaps we should now call them rebels) are being stepped up.  There are stories of a rebel army being formed in Turkey and of a rebel Council obviously patterned on the Libyan Transitional Council being set up there.  Apparently the French government will be the first to recognise this Council just as it was the first to recognise the Libyan Council in the spring.  One way or the other the war clouds are gathering.”The logic of war is that the most violent and ruthless people generally come out on top, and that is what has happened in Syria with the rise of the Islamic State.That in turn has provoked the Russians to act by starting their air campaign.  In doing so the Russians have the support of China, the Eurasian states, and the key regional powers, Iran and Iraq.  By contrast, as Obama’s plaintive comments and the article in the Daily Beast show, the US has been sidelined.If the US and West want to save some tatters of credibility out of this debacle, then now is probably their last chance to do what they should have done in 2011, which is get their Syrian proteges to sit down and talk with the Syrian government without preconditions.If they do that, then there is still a chance a settlement of the Syrian conflict can be agreed, allowing the focus to shift to where it should be, which is fighting the Islamic State.It has to be said however that with the US backed opposition now dominated by violent jihadists, the chances of successfully doing that now look remote.  Certainly they are far worse than they were back in 2011 or 2012.If the diplomatic route is to be followed - even at this very late stage - then the US and its allies will have to abandon their insane demand that President Assad go as a precondition for negotiations, and their equally insane demand that the Russians force him to go .There are some people in the West, like the writer of the article in the Daily Telegraph I attach below (since it is behind a paywall) who appear to understand this.It is far from clear however that US and Western leaders do.  Despite some optimistic claims to the contrary, the most Western leaders for the moment seem prepared to concede is that President Assad might remain in power for a few months until power is handed over to those the US has groomed to take over.  This is something to which the Russians will never agree, as Putin made clear in his recent interview with Charlie Rose, when he said“At no time in the past, now or in the future has or will Russia take any part in actions aimed at overthrowing (a) legitimate government.”The idea the Russians will shift from this position - or can be bullied or bribed with threats or offers of Syrian bases to do so - is fantastic.  It is an idea that has been repeatedly tested over the last four years, and which has repeatedly been proved to be wrong.  It is incredible that - judging from the ceaseless Western media refrain that Russia \"push\" Assad into \"negotiations\" (ie. force him to go) - so many people in the West still don't grasp this.What the events of the last few weeks show is that the West now has a choice.  Either it revises its strategy, and engages meaningfully with the Russians - and President Assad - to find a way out of the Syrian crisis and to defeat the Islamic State, or the Russians will simply follow through the logic of their position and of their recent actions, and press on with their campaign together with their allies until the the Islamic State has been destroyed.  That is the objective Putin has declared, and there is no reason to think the Russians will not pursue it until it has been achieved.  The forces that are gathering, not just from Russia but also from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, from within Syria itself, and possibly even from China, are almost certainly enough to achieve it.The US and the West will in that case find themselves sidelined, becoming bystanders with none of their objectives in Syria achieved.  If that is the result, then the blame for the humiliation they will suffer will lie in their own intransigence and folly.  The \"exceptional country\", it will turn out, is not so exceptional after all.-----------------------------------The following article was first published in the Daily TelegraphFear of the peace: Why Assad is not the main obstacle to a deal on SyriaBig Question: Disagreement on Assad's fate in Syria is not the main obstacle to a peace deal – the real issue is addressing fears of what may followBy Tom HillRussia has upped the ante in the Syrian war, initiating its first military campaign in the Middle East since 1941. Everyone is afraid of the Syrian crisis and where it might lead. Everyone says they want a resolution, most of all to enable unity against the abominable Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). Yet no international deal is in sight. Why?The current and long-standing consensus is that this is because of disagreements over Assad’s fate. But this belief is a major error that is hindering a solution to the Syrian crisis – and a cause of the escalation just unleashed by Russia.Observers of civil wars almost always forget one crucial impediment to peacemaking. In even the most terrible of civil wars, for some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself – the wrong peace.Fear of the peaceThis is a lesson pertinent to Syria. The divisions over the “Assad question” are not the cause of the international and regional impasse on Syria; they are instead a manifestation of it – most of all relating to the peace that is expected to follow the war.For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself – the wrong peace.For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself – the For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself – the wrong peace peace. some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself – the wrong peace.For some there is always a more terrifying threat than the war itself – the wrong peaceWhat are those fears? There are too many to list here, but begin by. For Iran the conflict is not about Assad, or even Syria. It is about Lebanon.What are those fears? There are too many to list here, but begin by considering Iran’s interestsDue to the historical linkages between Syria and Lebanon, it is impossible for Iran to imagine that Hizbollah, its proxy in southern Lebanon, will survive if neighbouring Syria is ruled by a government actively hostile to Iranian interests. This is an existential issue for Iran because Hizbollah is Iran’s deterrent against Israel. And without safeguards, Iran believes that removing Assad will surely mean the emergence of a sectarian, Sunni-dominated state – which will certainly be hostile to Iran.This is Iran’s fear of the peace. Without agreements on safeguards that will prevent a sectarian political system and convince Iran there will not be a “tyranny of the majority” in Syria, the Assad question will continue to dominate.But Assad is secondary, rather than the issue itself, and this indicates a way around the Assad conundrum.The Russian questionRussia has been more explicit, repeatedly demanding an answer from the West on the question: “if Assad goes, who will replace him?”Few Western analysts trust President Putin’s statements, but he is being honest in his expressions of concern for what will follow.For Russia this relates to keeping Syria within their sphere of influence, retaining their Tartus naval base and airbase in Latakia, keeping their privileged relationship with Syria’s military – including lucrative arms deals – and having a sure platform for fighting terrorists that might threaten Russia.Many Syrians too are afraid of what the end of the war will bring. Non-Sunnis and Kurds are deeply fearful of the prospect of a sectarian, Sunni Arab-dominated political system. They are unable to imagine how such a scenario will include full citizenship, equal rights and protections for minorities. They won’t say it explicitly, as they too yearn for peace, but in their eyes the war is preferable to a peace on those terms.And without agreed safeguards on the character of the post-conflict political system – agreements that currently do not exist – they will remain convinced that this is what Assad’s departure will mean.This fear is perhaps the primary driver of loyalty to the Syrian regime.What does this suggest for negotiations?Lord Soames, reflecting on the end of the civil war in Zimbabwe in 1980, wrote that the British mediators learnt “to decide first whether the Sunday school treat was going to Bognor or Bournemouth … and discuss later whether it should go by train or coach.” What Lord Soames meant was that before Britain could successfully mediate an agreement on a transitional government and a ceasefire, the parties had to agree first, in broad terms, to the end state that the peace process would deliver.There needs to be agreement on what they are buying before they are asked to pay the priceThe mediators had to neutralise the belligerents’ fear of the peace before they could get them to agree on how to end the war.In Syria this means that the fear of the peace also needs to be neutralised, as a first step towards effective negotiations – both among Syrians and among the international stakeholders. There are viable constitutional and institutional mechanisms and international agreements that could be negotiated that would reassure Syrians that the post-conflict political system will not become a sectarian tyranny of the Sunni majority.And there are constitutional and international guarantees that could be negotiated to ensure a democratic Syria will not become, in the eyes of Iran, a threat to Hizbollah in Lebanon. And there are agreements that could be negotiated that reassure Russia that its place in Syria will remain.These will not end the challenge of the Assad question, but they could remove the fears that make it so difficult to handle.Four wasted yearsBut these kinds of agreements take time – time that may have just run out. Four years have been hopelessly wasted in negotiations that always began and ended with the Western demand that Assad must go or, at the most, go after a little while.It is absurd to think – as Assad’s foes seemed to believe through their latest offers – that conceding that Assad might remain for a few weeks or months could somehow reassure Russia and Iran of their long-term interests in Syria.It is the long-term character of the Syrian state, its political system and what this means for its foreign relations that has been the primary obstacle to successful negotiations on Syria.It all comes down to a simple principle of commerce. If Assad is to go, then no one will have to do more to make this happen than Russia, Iran and Syrians themselves. There needs to be agreement on what they are buying before they are asked to pay the price.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77cf194719c855216573b7"},"header":"Ukraine and Syria Made NATO More Useless Than Ever","time":"Sat, May 14, 2016","content":"Russia shouldn’t help the alliance to restore its influenceThe author is a professor of the Higher School of EconomicsThe relationship between Moscow and NATO, that was deteriorating since long before the ‘Crimean pivot’, continues to be the crucial element in a broader relationship between the West and Russia. Media statements by leaders makes them even worse. Recently, the newly appointed Commander, Curtis Scaparrotti, declared the alliance is ready to fight Russia. However, his predecessor, Philip Breedlove, was also verbally aggressive, and the Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg, shows no restraint when it comes to propaganda.   Recent statements by NATO leaders sound not only hysterical but also rather helpless. We aren’t claiming  that the alliance has nothing to oppose Russia with. NATO is the largest military and political organization of modern times, and it would be useless and even harmful to deny it.But the fact is that NATO is now at the margins of global policy. Over the last couple of years, there have been many situations when the alliance could have played a key part, either positive or destabilizing – but didn’t. The civil war in the Ukraine, the aggravation of the situation in Iraq, Syria, the spread of ISIS in Libya, only a few hundred kilometers from Europe, renewed civil war in Afghanistan. Finally, there was a win-win situation for NATO: instability in the Mediterranean Area, cross-border criminality, illegal migration and refugees. It could have countered those low-level threats it talked so much about in 1990’s. However, it failed again, and as a result, the omnipresent Frau Merkel planted in European heads the idea of a European army that, were it to be implemented, would make NATO meaningless. Why did this happen? On the one hand, US influence in NATO is shamelessly huge even with respect to Europe. On the other hand, alliance activity is so bureaucratized and politicized that it can only solve small problems, and only if the US is directly involved. Apart from that, NATO is becoming a political and information entity trying hard to keep its place in the system of European security. That’s why Baltic and Ukrainian politicians are warmly welcomed in NATO: they talk incessantly about the alliance, since it is a major proof of their existence. It seems that without these recurrent hysterics, NATO would actually drop off the global agenda. They keep it going, at least in terms of propaganda. There is nothing good about that. NATO is the largest political/bureaucratic/media system that has ever existed. And it is a large community of people whose high salaries ensure that they personally value it. It’s naïve to think that they would agree to abandon the European military and political process without making a last stand. Although the alliance is now only marginal, its members have become accustomed to ‘downshifting’ from the ‘Major League’ of world policy, and their style and political orientation are changing accordingly. So when we talk about ‘a dialogue with NATO’, we should keep in mind that the only way to have a meaningful dialogue with the current alliance is to be aware that it is no longer headed by the biggest names in Atlantic policy to whom secret and obvious political threads led. Russia should reject the idea it has had since the 1990’s, that it was better to have security in Europe with NATO than without it. Maybe that was actually the case for a while. But we’ve been living in a new world for a long time, a world of ‘quantum instability’ and hybrid wars, in which the alliance failed to prove itself and is unlikely to do so. The reality is that the situation in Europe will be defined by two contradictory factors: on the one hand, returning to security issues as the main basis for relations between the majority of European states and Russia. Sad, but true. On the other hand, the fragmentation of the current security space and the creation of a new space in a ‘Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals’. This idea is still likely to be studied, but the most interesting thing is that a relatively high security level and political stability appears in the areas controlled by Russia, including by force. For example, in the Crimea, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia did its best to maintain the ‘indivisibility of security’ in Europe. It’s not Russia’s fault that this security (partly thanks to NATO ) turned out to be divisible, not only politically but geographically. Russia cannot and should not take on the burden of restoring this ‘indivisibility’, promoting NATO’s returning to the ‘Major League’. This is what the alliance wants, at the cost of engaging a direct military confrontation with Russia, even if it means transforming some of its territories into ‘near-frontline zones’ (which is profitable for the bankrupted elites of a number of states). We should be ready to accept a new regime of security in Europe and take an active part in creating new institutions, which will not be long in coming. We should get ready to  recognize that NATO can suddenly cease to be the only partner for discussing these issues. This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

It had no record of human rights violations or mass beheadings every year like our good ally Saudi Arabia.2) Assad is the recognized legitimate leader of Syria by the whole world.3) There was no unrest in Syria untill a country 8,000 miles away decided they didn't like Assad - who the hell knows why. Just a guess: Assad wasn't going to let said country steal Syrian resources for pennies on the dollar. Said country was not Russia but the USA. No little non-nuclear armed country can refuse these type of American \"requests\" - there will be consequences. The consequence for Syria was the funding of a rebel insurgency.4) That actions like this violate international law means nothing to the USA, especially when their \"request\" (demand) for access to cheap resources is turned down.5)  If the funded mercenary revolution is not succeeding, that's when the aircraft carrier shows up to assist the mercenary forces. US aircraft start flying in Syrian airspace without permission, (violation of International Law) and then with no declaration of war, nor attack on US assets by Syria. We start bombing the Syrian military and infrastructure, like bridges, highways, oil facilities - you know, trying to wreck their economy. This is a gross violation of international law. As for bombing cities, let's put it this way. If something of real importance is in downtown Damascus it will be hit. We don't follow international law unless it's favorable to us. The only rule we like is \"might makes right\" or \"because we can, and they can't strike back.\" The fact is, all the Syrians killed by our bombing, or even by the mercenary forces we fund, the US is totally responsible for because every move we make on the sea, in the air or on the ground in Syria is illegal, because everyone of them breaks international law!6) Russia is operating legally in Syria under international law, because the legitimate recognized Syrian Government asked for help to get rid of the scum the US had illegally funded and armed on Syrian territory. The Syrian Government is fighting a Civil War started by US funded and armed insurgents, who have taken the city of Aleppo which they have held a long time. Anyone with a brain bigger then a pea, knows street to street, house to house fighting is the bloodiest, most difficult of all combat. And when the insurgents are dug in and well armed within fortifications you need to bomb the buildings to make it possible to win. And yes civilians are going to die, that's what happens in inner-city warfare. It comes with the situation. But even these deaths are the responsibility of the USA and NeoCons like Bush, Obama and Hillary Clinton.Check how bloody and deadly the USA's own civil war was. That was the last real war the US has fought were there were real battles fought on US soil.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

We know it's a radical conceptThe meltdown continues. We knew that the Israeli media would go bananas over Syria's decision to defend itself against Israeli airstrikes. But who could have foreseen this level of bananas? Complements of a Times of Israel \"partner\", we learn: \"Israelis Now Forced To Consider The Putin Factor: Is Russia no longer Israel’s security blanket in the Syrian civil war?\"Strange. We remember when Putin announced Russia's air operations in Syria. But we don't remember him mentioning anything about Russian forces intervening in order to be \"Israel's security blanket\".Let's allow the author to clarify. Perhaps we're misreading this brain-dead question:What was said about Israeli activities over the Syrian border a week ago only during private meetings is now discussed openly by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “When we detect attempts to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah and we have the intelligence and feasibility to carry out an operation, we will work to prevent it,” he said.But if Israelis are internalizing this reality, they’re still mostly failing to grasp the new and unsettling questions about the Russian regime. Russia is Israel’s security blanket in the Syrian civil war, with its presence there helping to keep the Syrian regime from acting against Israel, isn’t it? Perhaps not, seeing that Russia didn’t prevent the firing of anti-aircraft missiles towards Israeli targets.We see. So Russia isn't in Syria to fight the \"moderate\" rebels and Islamic State (which Israel prefers to Iran); no, Putin's primary objective in Syria is to \"help keep the Syrian regime from acting against Israel\". And if Russia isn't \"protecting\" Israel from Syria, this clearly raises \"new and unsettling questions about the Russian regime\".Here's an idea: What about just \"not bombing Syria\"? Isn't that a good first step towards security and friendly relations with your neighbor? Please just stop. But alas, it doesn't stop:The situation is baffling, even to Syria experts like Hebrew University’s Moshe Maoz. “There are so many enigmas, and it’s very difficult to know what is going on,” Maoz told me this week. Was the Syrian regime prepared to act against Israel in defiance of Russia, which would be worrying, or did Russia give it the go-ahead to fire, which would be deeply concerning?It's certainly baffling that Israel thinks it can bomb a sovereign nation with impunity — and then goes crying to Putin when it can't. We do not believe that Russia is interested in any kind of confrontation with Israel. But this idea that Russia was Israel's mall cop in Syria is a bit extreme. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has made it clear that Russia thinks Hezbollah has played an important role in defeating ISIS in Syria. A bit of a diplomatic pickle for the Israelis, no?It's clear that Russia and Israel have some sort of understanding in Syria. What's also clear is that last week's airstrikes near Palmyra (the Israelis insist they were targeting weapon shipments for Hezbollah) violated this understanding. We reported earlier this week that Syria's U.N. envoy Bashar Jaafari said that Syria's use of anti-aircraft missiles against Israeli fighter jets was a \"message\" from Putin.Israel's ambassador was summoned by Moscow after Friday's airstrikes, and reports have emerged that Russian military advisors were operating just a few kilometers from the area that was targeted by Israeli strikes; so there's certainly circumstantial evidence to back up Jaafari's claim. But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists the exact opposite — that Putin understands that \"if there is a feasibility from an intelligence and military standpoint - [Israel will] attack [targets in Syria]\".If Israel seeks \"security\", maybe it should compromise and cooperate with its neighbors, instead of rooting for ISIS to win in Syria? It's a radical proposition — but it just might work.P.S. — a final blockquote from this media metldown, because we can't resist:Two weeks ago Netanyahu stood at the Kremlin, talking to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin about Purim and the concern of Israelis of modern Haman-like plans to destroy the Jews.Yeah, that wasn't very compelling. Next time Netanyahu should try citing current events, instead of Bible stories from 2,000 years ago: This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

We have to more clearly define what our position is,\" he said.- New powers -Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to quickly defeat IS, ordered his generals to come up with a revised plan to defeat the jihadist group.The review resulted in an \"annihilation campaign\" aimed at killing all IS fighters, and saw commanders gain greater autonomy to make battlefield decisions and approve strikes.Thomas said the new powers would not have played any role in the recent decisions to attack pro-regime forces, as these were all ordered in self-defense.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group","url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4618860/Americas-widening-role-Syrias-civil-war.html","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:17:39.800Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77d7764719c866a1b70899"},"header":"America’s True Role in Syria","time":"Sep 5, 2016","content":"A Member of Kurdish People Defence Units (YPG) sits on a truck after coming from the Syrian town of al-Raqqa, in Tel Abyad, Syria, 23 June 2015.NEW YORK – Syria’s civil war is the most dangerous and destructive crisis on the planet. Since early 2011, hundreds of thousands have died; around ten million Syrians have been displaced; Europe has been convulsed with Islamic State (ISIS) terror and the political fallout of refugees; and the United States and its NATO allies have more than once come perilously close to direct confrontation with Russia.Unfortunately, President Barack Obama has greatly compounded the dangers by hiding the US role in Syria from the American people and from world opinion. An end to the Syrian war requires an honest accounting by the US of its ongoing, often secretive role in the Syrian conflict since 2011, including who is funding, arming, training, and abetting the various sides. Such exposure would help bring to an end many countries’ reckless actions.A widespread – and false – perception is that Obama has kept the US out of the Syrian war. Indeed, the US right wing routinely criticizes him for having drawn a line in the sand for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over chemical weapons, and then backing off when Assad allegedly crossed it (the issue remains murky and disputed, like so much else in Syria).  A leading columnist for the Financial Times, repeating the erroneous idea that the US has remained on the sidelines, recently implied that Obama had rejected the advice of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to arm the Syrian rebels fighting Assad.Yet the curtain gets lifted from time to time. In January, the New York Times finally reported on a secret 2013 Presidential order to the CIA to arm Syrian rebels. As the account explained, Saudi Arabia provides substantial financing of the armaments, while the CIA, under Obama’s orders, provides organizational support and training.Unfortunately, the story came and went without further elaboration by the US government or follow up by the New York Times. The public was left in the dark: How big are the ongoing CIA-Saudi operations? How much is the US spending on Syria per year? What kinds of arms are the US, Saudis, Turks, Qataris, and others supplying to the Syrian rebels? Which groups are receiving the arms? What is the role of US troops, air cover, and other personnel in the war? The US government isn’t answering these questions, and mainstream media aren’t pursuing them, either.On more than a dozen occasions, Obama has told the American people that there would be “no US boots on the ground.” Yet every few months, the public is also notified in a brief government statement that US special operations forces are being deployed to Syria. The Pentagon routinely denies that they are in the front lines. But when Russia and the Assad government recently carried out bombing runs and artillery fire against rebel strongholds in northern Syria, the US notified the Kremlin that the attacks were threatening American troops on the ground. The public has been given no explanation about their mission, its costs, or counterparties in Syria.Through occasional leaks, investigative reports, statements by other governments, and rare statements by US officials, we know that America is engaged in an active, ongoing, CIA-coordinated war both to overthrow Assad and to fight ISIS. America’s allies in the anti-Assad effort include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and other countries in the region. The US has spent billions of dollars on arms, training, special operations forces, air strikes, and logistical support for the rebel forces, including international mercenaries. American allies have spent billions of dollars more. The precise sums are not reported.The US public has had no say in these decisions. There has been no authorizing vote or budget approval by the US Congress. The CIA’s role has never been explained or justified. The domestic and international legality of US actions has never been defended to the American people or the world.To those at the center of the US military-industrial complex, this secrecy is as it should be. Their position is that a vote by Congress 15 years ago authorizing the use of armed force against those culpable for the 9/11 attack gives the president and military carte blanche to fight secret wars in the Middle East and Africa. Why should the US explain publicly what it is doing? That would only jeopardize the operations and strengthen the enemy. The public does not need to know.I subscribe to a different view: wars should be a last resort and should be constrained by democratic scrutiny. This view holds that America’s secret war in Syria is illegal both under the US Constitution (which gives Congress the sole power to declare war) and under the United Nations Charter, and that America’s two-sided war in Syria is a cynical and reckless gamble. The US-led efforts to topple Assad are not aimed at protecting the Syrian people, as Obama and Clinton have suggested from time to time, but are a US proxy war against Iran and Russia, in which Syria happens to be the battleground.The stakes of this war are much higher and much more dangerous than America’s proxy warriors imagine. As the US has prosecuted its war against Assad, Russia has stepped up its military support to his government. In the US mainstream media, Russia’s behavior is an affront: how dare the Kremlin block the US from overthrowing the Syrian government? The result is a widening diplomatic clash with Russia, one that could escalate and lead – perhaps inadvertently – to the point of military conflict.These are issues that should be subject to legal scrutiny and democratic control. I am confident that the American people would respond with a resounding “no” to the ongoing US-led war of regime change in Syria. The American people want security – including the defeat of ISIS – but they also recognize the long and disastrous history of US-led regime-change efforts, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.This is the main reason why the US security state refuses to tell the truth. The American people would call for peace rather than perpetual war. Obama has a few months left in office to repair his broken legacy. He should start by leveling with the American people. © Project Syndicate 1995–2016\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","url":"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/americas-true-role-syria/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:23:16.881Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Assad, who trained in London as an ophthalmologist, came to power through a twist of fate: his oldest brother Basil who had been groomed to succeed their father was killed in car crash in 1994, leaving Bashar as the next in line. He quickly showed promise as a young reformer after his father’s autocratic government, but those hopes faded before being almost forgotten entirely in the carnage of the civil war.— AHMAD AL-JARBA: The leader of the main Western-backed opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition. Elected to the post in July, al-Jarba hails from Syria’s northeastern province of Hassakeh and is a member of the powerful Shammar tribe that extends into neighboring Iraq. He was a little-known anti-Assad figure before Syria’s civil war though he was detained in March 2011 — days after the uprising against Assad began. It was his second arrest, following one in 1996 when he was held for two years because of anti-government activities. After his release, al-Jarba left Syria in August 2011 and became active in the opposition. He is widely viewed as being close to Saudi Arabia, and his election as coalition chief was seen as a sign that Riyadh had taken over the mantle as the rebellion’s main patron from Qatar.— GEN. SALIM IDRIS: The commander of the coalition’s military wing, the Supreme Military Council, which brings together a collection of loosely-knit rebel brigades under the emblem of the Free Syrian Army. His group serves as the main conduit for Western military aid to moderate rebel groups, although Idris says that support has been meager and slow to arrive. The general, a former lecturer at Syria’s main military college, took up his post in December. He says he travels to rebel-held areas in Syria frequently, and also stays in touch with his officers by Skype. He defected from the Syrian military after 35 years, and is seen as a secular-minded moderate.— JABHAT AL-NUSRA: An Islamist extremist group affiliated with al-Qaida. Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Nusra Front, has emerged as one of the most powerful rebel factions on the battlefield. The U.S. has designated the group a terrorist organization. Jabhat al-Nusra has claimed responsibility for many of the deadliest suicide bombings targeting regime and military facilities. The presence of Islamic extremists among the rebels is one reason the West has not equipped the Syrian opposition with sophisticated weapons, such as anti-aircraft missiles. In recent months, Jabhat al-Nusra has been eclipsed to a degree by the rising power of another al-Qaida-affiliated group — the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.— ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND THE LEVANT: Al-Qaida’s longtime affiliate in Iraq. The Islamic State has moved aggressively in recent months into Syria, and has established a major presence particularly in the north. It has not limited its efforts to fighting the government alone, but has opened fronts against more moderate rebel groups, as well as Syria’s Kurdish minority. The group also is known to cooperate with other rebel factions for specific operations. Syrian activists say the Islamic State is largely composed of foreign fighters and has shown a degree of ruthlessness beyond that of Jabhat al-Nusra.— HEZBOLLAH: The Lebanese Shiite militant group. Hezbollah has sent its gunmen to fight alongside Assad’s forces, providing a significant boost to the government’s overstretched military. Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah has suggested he would do everything it takes to save Assad’s government, which has been a patron and ally of the militant group for decades. Hezbollah’s deep involvement in the conflict underlines the regional sectarian aspect of the conflict, in which an Iranian-backed Shiite axis faces off against Sunnis supported by Gulf Arabs in a proxy war extending into neighboring Lebanon and Iraq. \nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77d7ac4719c866a1b708a1"},"header":"Ending America’s  Disastrous Role in Syria","time":"Feb 26, 2018","content":"Much of the carnage that has ravaged Syria during the past seven years is due to the actions of the United States and its allies in the Middle East. Now, faced with an alarming risk of a renewed escalation of fighting, it’s time for the United Nations Security Council to step in to end the bloodshed, based on a new framework agreed by the Council’s permanent members.Here are the basics. In 2011, in the context of the Arab Spring, the US government, in conjunction with the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and Israel, decided to bring down Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, even though overthrowing another country’s government amounts to a blatant violation of international law. We know that in 2012, if not earlier, President Barack Obama authorized the CIA to work with America’s allies in providing support to rebel forces composed of disaffected Syrians as well as non-Syrian fighters. US policymakers evidently expected Assad to fall quickly, as had occurred with the governments of Tunisia and Egypt in the early months of the Arab Spring.The Assad regime is led by the minority Alawi Shia sect in a country where Alawites account for just 10% of the population, Sunni Muslims account for 75%, Christians make up 10%, and 5% are others, including Druze. The regional powers behind Assad’s regime include Iran and Russia, which has a naval base on Syria’s Mediterranean coastline.Whereas America’s goal in seeking to topple Assad was mainly to undercut Iranian and Russian influence, Turkey’s motive was to expand its influence in former Ottoman lands and, more recently, to counter Kurdish ambitions for territorial autonomy, if not statehood, in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia wanted to undermine Iran’s influence in Syria while expanding its own, while Israel, too, aimed to counter Iran, which threatens Israel through Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria near the Golan Heights, and Hamas in Gaza. Qatar, meanwhile, wanted to bring a Sunni Islamist regime to power.The armed groups supported by the US and allies since 2011 were assembled under the banner of the Free Syrian Army. In fact, there was no single army, but rather competing armed groups with distinct backers, ideologies, and goals. The fighters ranged from dissident Syrians and autonomy-seeking Kurds to Sunni jihadists backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.While vast resources were devoted to overthrowing Assad, the effort ultimately failed, but not before causing massive bloodshed and displacing millions of Syrians. Many fled to Europe, fomenting Europe’s refugee crisis and a surge in political support for Europe’s anti-immigrant extreme right.There were four main reasons for the failure to overthrow Assad. First, Assad’s regime had backing among not only Alawites, but also Syrian Christians and other minorities who feared a repressive Sunni Islamist regime. Second, the US-led coalition was countered by Iran and Russia. Third, when a splinter group of jihadists split away to form the Islamic State (ISIS), the US diverted significant resources to defeating it, rather than to toppling Assad. Finally, the anti-Assad forces have been deeply and chronically divided; for example, Turkey is in open conflict with the Kurdish fighters backed by the US.All of these reasons for failure remain valid today. The war is at a stalemate. Only the bloodshed continues.America’s official narrative has sought to conceal the scale and calamitous consequences of US efforts – in defiance of international law and the UN Charter – to overthrow Assad. While the US vehemently complains about Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, America and its allies have repeatedly violated Syrian sovereignty. The US government mischaracterizes the war as a civil war among Syrians, rather than a proxy war involving the US, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Qatar.In July 2017, US President Donald Trump announced the end of CIA support for the Syrian rebels. In practice, though, US engagement continues, though now it is apparently aimed more at weakening Assad than overthrowing him. As part of America’s continued war-making, the Pentagon announced in December that US forces would remain indefinitely in Syria, ostensibly to support anti-Assad rebel forces in areas captured from ISIS, and of course without the assent of the Syrian government.The war is in fact at risk of a new round of escalation. When Assad’s regime recently attacked anti-Assad rebels, the US coalition launched airstrikes that killed around 100 Syrian troops and an unknown number of Russian fighters. Following this show of force, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis disingenuously stated that, “Obviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war.” In addition, Israel recently attacked Iranian positions in Syria.The US and its allies should face reality and accept the persistence of Assad’s regime, despicable as it may be. The UN Security Council, backed by the US, Russia, and the other major powers, should step in with peacekeepers to restore Syrian sovereignty and urgent public services, while blocking attempts at vengeance by the Assad regime against former rebels or their civilian supporters.Yes, the Assad regime would remain in power, and Iran and Russia would maintain their influence in Syria. But the US official delusion that America can call the shots in Syria by choosing who rules, and with which allies, would end. It’s long past time for a far more realistic approach, in which the Security Council pushes Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, and Israel into a pragmatic peace that ends the bloodshed and allows the Syrian people to resume their lives and livelihoods.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","url":"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/ending-americas-disastrous-role-syria/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:24:10.171Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The draft resolution was vetoed by Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s Ambassador to the United Nations. \u0008EPA-EFE/JUSTIN LANEThe die, it seems, is cast for a rapid end to the United States mission in Syria – and, with it, the chances of a peaceful and sustainable resolution to that country’s brutal seven-year civil war. The chemical attack allegedly carried out last week by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces in Douma, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region, shows just how dangerous that prospect is for Syria and the world.US President Donald Trump’s bluster in the wake of the chemical attack exposes the incoherence and contradictions of his approach, as well as his lack of any real strategy in Syria. Ordering an attack or two against Assad’s forces, as he might do, would neither alter the balance of power there, nor improve Trump’s position in the war-torn country, let alone the Middle East in general.To be sure, Trump’s top military advisers have persuaded him to keep in place the 2,000 military personnel currently stationed in Syria. But he has already limited America’s objectives there to eliminating the small remaining Islamic State (ISIS) presence – an effort that should take about six months.In constraining America’s commitment, Trump has forfeited the opportunity to help shape Syria’s future, reinforcing the widespread perception – which has taken hold among friends and foes alike – that US global leadership is in retreat. He has also disregarded the country’s ongoing humanitarian crisis, the worst since World War II.Ironically, this narrow approach also undermines the effort to achieve Trump’s sole objective, as a lasting defeat of ISIS and other jihadists will demand a credible political transition that permanently ends the civil war. Such a transition will be possible only through diplomatic engagement by actors with stakes in Syria.With Trump’s withdrawal implying that the US and its allies have lost the war, Assad already feels emboldened to forge ahead – with Russian and Iranian support – with his plan to recapture the remaining rebel-held territories at all costs. After establishing “facts on the ground,” Assad and his allies would be able to present the world with a fait accompli: Assad remains in power, without making any real concessions to the opposition.Local and regional actors that placed their faith in America’s commitments will pay a bloody price. In particular, the Kurds – America’s most reliable and effective ally in the fight against ISIS – are likely to be left out in the cold, despite official US assurances about security arrangements after the US withdrawal.Already, Kurds have criticized the Trump administration for sacrificing them at the altar of America’s strategic relations with Turkey. The US turned a blind eye to Turkey’s recent invasion and occupation of the Kurdish-held city of Afrin in northwest Syria, which led to the slaughter of more than 1,000 Kurds, including scores of civilians.With a US withdrawal, the Kurds may feel compelled to ally with Assad for protection. Hundreds of Kurdish fighters have already deserted the fight against ISIS in northeast Syria, journeying to Afrin to resist the joint assault by Turkey and a splinter group of Syrian rebels. Some young Kurds have begun to join Assad’s paramilitary units to avenge the loss of Afrin.But it will be a difficult battle, as America’s departure is likely to strengthen Turkey’s hand further. After all, without the US, the other main foreign powers in the Syrian conflict – Turkey, Russia, and Iran – will be able to consolidate their spheres of influence and divide the spoils of the post-war reconstruction among themselves. While their specific interests may differ, all three countries share a vision of a “soft” partition of Syria that reduces Assad and the rebels to mere proxies.Russia and Iran will be the two biggest winners. Russian President Vladimir Putin is the kingmaker whose timely military intervention saved Assad’s regime from defeat and turned the war’s tide in his favor. Whereas the US is almost nowhere to be seen in Syria, Russia is everywhere, constantly rearranging the pieces on the conflict’s chessboard.Russia’s coordination with all major regional powers – including Turkey, a NATO member – attests to the dynamism (and cynicism) of the Kremlin’s foreign policy. As the US pulls up stakes in Syria, Turkey’s military and economic ties to Russia will only deepen.Like Russia, Iran has invested plenty of blood and treasure to save Assad’s regime – and reaped handsome returns. Iran is now the most influential regional power in Syria, as it is in Iraq and Lebanon. But the rush to fill the vacuum left by the US might provide the spark that ignites a region-wide war. There are legitimate concerns that Israel might use the withdrawal of US troops as a pretext to intensify its attacks on Iran and Hezbollah in Syria – a decision that could escalate into all-out regional conflict, one that draws in the US, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main rival for regional hegemony.Even leaving aside Trump’s hostility to the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement – which adds yet another source of risk to an already perilous situation – there is now a real and present danger that Syria will become the site of a conflagration even more destructive than the one raging there since 2011.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018. www.project-syndicate.org\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","url":"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/trump-syria-threat-region-wide-war/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:24:51.021Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, says Riyadh is discussing the possibility of sending troops to Syria amid US draw down. Saudi Arabia is holding talks with the US about sending troops into northeast Syria as part of an international coalition that would replace US forces , said Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir.The statement was made in the wake of US President Donald J. Trump’s surprise announcement that he plans to pull out American military personnel from Syria and hand over the responsibility to Arab nations from the Gulf and surrounding Levant.Speaking at a press conference alongside UN Head Antonio Guterres on April 17, al-Jubeir said Riyadh had considered deploying an expeditionary force into Syria early as 2011, when the ongoing conflict first began.“We made a proposal to the Obama administration that if the US were to send forces…then Saudi Arabia would consider doing so, along with other countries, as part of a joint contingent,” said al-Jubeir.The Saudi Defence Ministry had in 2016 already offered to send ground troops to Syria to participate in operations carried out by the US-led coalition against ISIS. The Saudis, however stopped short of committing to a full deployment of ground troops to fight ISIS after having already become bogged down in the ongoing Yemeni Civil War. At the time, Riyadh offered to take part in a limited capacity, saying they were ready to launch air strikes against the Islamic State.Al-Jubeir’s latest statement likely indicates the determination of the Saudis to continue their campaign of countering the influence of Iran, Riyadh’s traditional archenemy in the Middle East.Saudi Arabia’s State Minister for Arab Gulf Affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, visited the then-recently liberated Syrian city of Raqqa in September 2017, the self-declared capital of ISIS, to offer Saudi financial assistance for the city’s reconstruction.According to Samir Seifan, an economist and researcher from the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, the US’ approach to Syria following ISIS’ defeat is similar to the military strategy employed in Iraq before the Americans’ formal withdrawal in 2011.“On the one hand, Trump wants to pull American troops out of Syria. But on the other hand, Washington wants to keep control of the developments in the region. The same thing happened to the American policy in Iraq…we are well aware how it ended up,” Seifan said.The Syrian War began after the country’s Sunni population was swept up by the Arab Spring protests the spread from the Maghreb in North Africa to the Persian Gulf over the course of the last weeks of 2011 and early 2012.The initials stages of the fighting saw a bloody civil war break out between the majority Sunnis and forces loyal to the government of Bashar al-Assad, a member of the minority Alawite community, a sect of Shia Islam.The war later expanded into a proxy war between Assad’s main backers –Russia, Iran, and Lebanon’s radical Shiite party, Hezbollah – against a US-led coalition that supported the Syrian rebels. Since the involvement of the outside players in the conflict, as well as the rise of ISIS in early 2014, and the battlefield success of Syria’s Kurds and Turkey’s subsequent invasion of the north of country to crush their advances, the war has become a morass of multi-sided conflicts with few prospects of forging a lasting peace agreement that is acceptable to all sides.According to the UN, over 5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict and 6 million more are internally displaced, while an estimated 13 million people are in need of urgent assistance.      \nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","url":"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/saudi-arabia-considers-deployment-troops-syria/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:25:03.888Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

It has proposed the establishment of a new alternative international investigative body to carry out the work. The US says this is an attempt to shield the Assad regime by means of distraction.On two previous occasions, Russia has used its UN veto to block the extension of the previous inquiry.Speaking at the UN, Nikki Haley, US Ambassador, said:\"Simply put when Russia doesn't like the facts they try and distract the conversation.

As a result, thousands of leaked photos mean prosecutors have far stronger evidence of war crimes than what existed to convict the Nazis at Nuremberg, said Rapp, the former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues under President Barack Obama.The documents amassed so far form a \"paper trail of war crimes\" noteworthy for their specificity, according to Engels, who requested NBC News not reveal the location of the group's office out of concern for investigators' safety and the security of the evidence. The documents are stored in a vault.The group's 140-person staff is made up of lawyers, investigators, and translators. That includes more than 40 \"document hunters\" in Syria whose mission is to extract material produced by the regime, authorizing the detention, torture, and execution of people for suspected anti-government activity.More on MSNBC's \"On Assignment with Richard Engel\" Friday at 9 p.m. ETDocuments identify who in the regime signed off on what, who was targeted, and why. In some cases where the documents indicate that a prisoner admitted to participating in anti-regime activity, CIJA tracked down the accused, who later said their confessions were extracted through torture.The organization was founded by Bill Wiley, a Canadian former war crimes investigator, as news reports began surfacing of widespread abuses by the Assad regime in 2011. It receives funding from Western countries, including the British and Canadian governments, to carry out its work.Added to the trove of documents is vital visual evidence: roughly 50,000 photos shot between the start of the war in 2011 and 2013, cataloging more than 6,700 victims of torture by pro-regime forces. They were taken by a forensic photographer known by the pseudonym Caesar who worked for the Syrian military and smuggled them out of the country on hard drives in 2013.Assad has disputed the veracity of the photos, but Human Rights Watch called the images authentic. The New York-based group confirmed the identity of 27 victims in the photos through interview with relatives, while former prisoners and defectors have corroborated the widespread torture in government prisons. In a separate analysis, the FBI confirmed a portion of the photo trove as authentic. So did a U.N. report.Caesar's photos show emaciated corpses, many stripped naked, arrayed on the ground — some with gouged-out eyes, bloodied genitals, and severed fingers. Many show signs of bruises, burn marks, and gashes covering discolored skin. While most of the images are too graphic to air or publish, NBC News has included three below to illustrate the treatment thought to have been meted out to Syrian detainees.Other investigators and activists have also collected testimony, images and videos documenting atrocities committed by all sides during Syria's war, a U.N. quasi-prosecutorial body has said. The team announced Monday that it is preparing case files and has engaged with war crimes investigative units of different countries including in Europe, whose courts can exercise universal jurisdiction to prosecute.CIJA's goal is to prove government officials' individual criminal culpability, from the highest echelons in Damascus down to the provincial level. The Syrian government's formalized command-and-control structure, as well as its careful record-keeping, make that work easier.The Syrian government is \"process driven,\" Engels said. Directives — even those authorizing torture — were documented \"to make sure that everyone does what they're supposed to be doing.\"CIJA's work is logistically difficult and comes with significant risks. Over the course of the war, where rebels seized regime territory, CIJA's document hunters entered abandoned government facilities and extracted material — USBs, computer hard drives, reams of paper — that might contain evidence of war crimes.“They are dead-set against justice.”Next they had to safely store the material, and when possible, smuggle it through checkpoints and out of Syria. Engels says no one directly employed by CIJA was ever killed in the process, but people who worked closely with the team were.Once the documents are ferried out of Syria, the rest of the CIJA team sifts through them to build cases for future criminal prosecutions.Despite what CIJA and other investigators consider to be clear and overwhelming evidence of war crimes by Assad's government, the regime remains more firmly entrenched than at any other point in the war due in large part to the support of Russia, Iran and Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah.Now a concern among human rights lawyers pursuing a case against Assad's government is that victims of the regime will never see officials held to account.Criminal prosecutions within an international tribunal seem increasingly unlikely. For a case to come before the International Criminal Court, it has to be referred there by the United Nations Security Council. Russia and China, two of five veto-wielding members on the council, quashed such a move in 2014.\"They are dead-set against justice,\" Rapp said. \"They are dead set against any kind of investigation that's independent.\"So in place of an international tribunal, Engels and Rapp have been focusing on lower level domestic prosecutions, and are helping authorities issue arrest warrants and build cases against Syrian government functionaries who have since left the country for the West. Last year alone, Rapp says he fielded 400 requests from law enforcement officials in 12 different countries, including the FBI.In September, prosecutors in Sweden issued the first war crimes conviction of a Syrian army soldier who had sought asylum in the country: eight months in prison for violating personal dignity by posing with his foot on five corpses in a photo.Rapp and Engels admit that such small fare is an unsatisfactory answer to the millions displaced, wounded or left grieving loved ones killed in the war and who want to see Assad held accountable.\"It won't be as good as in an international court, but that's the only alternative we have right now,\" Rapp said.","url":"http://www.euronews.com/2018/03/29/investigators-quietly-probe-allegations-syrian-war-crimes-n858641","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:26:37.779Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Syria's civil war destroyed it.BEIRUT — Noura Ghazi Safadi fell for Bassel Khartabil at a pro-democracy protest in the Syrian town of Douma, near Damascus, in April 2011.\"He had this kindness and smartness,\" Safadi said. \"I felt like my heart started beating so strong!\"Three months later, in July, they got engaged.It was in the middle of the Arab Spring, and thousands of Syrians had taken to the streets demanding democratic reforms. The optimistic protests had yet to descend into a vicious civil war. The Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta — where Douma is — had not become \"hell on Earth,\" and hundreds of thousands had yet to die in violence that has driven millions from their homes.\"I just want my love to be with me even if he's dead. Is it an impossible dream?\"It was a giddy time. She, a human rights lawyer, and he, a self-taught software engineer, became inseparable and they attended demonstrations together, desperately hoping for change from the government of President Bashar al-Assad.But the relationship fell victim to the war, which is now in its eighth year. Khartabil was arrested in March 2012 — two weeks before his wedding — and, as Safadi learned in August, he was executed in 2015. She has yet to receive official notice from the regime that Khartabil is dead.Instead, Safadi waits, and hurts.For more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News\" tonight\"I want to go there and to talk to him like I used to do,\" she said.Safadi, a small, soft-spoken woman with a steely resolve, has made it her mission to bury her beloved and mourn his loss at a gravesite, but she has been told nothing about the return of his body.Khartabil, whose computer skills were widely known among programmers outside Syria, had long wanted to make the internet more accessible in his own country. Active as an open-source software developer, he was known to translate Wikipedia entries from English into Arabic. When anti-government protests erupted in Syria, he used his tech savvy to get around strict government censorship and posted hundreds of videos of demonstrations online so the world would learn what was happening inside the country.A video recorded just months after Khartabil and Safadi met shows them beaming, playfully describing the beginning of their relationship.\"We expected everything was going to be solved, and we would win,\" Safadi said as she watched the video alongside NBC News, referring to the changes they desperately hoped for.But beneath the optimism ran an undercurrent of foreboding. Shortly after the demonstrations began, Assad responded with a bloody crackdown. Unarmed protesters were mowed down by bullets and tank shells. Still more were detained and tortured.As the euphoria of the protests dissipated and darkness descended, Khartabil realized he had now something to lose.\"I never had a problem with them arresting me before we got engaged, but now I'm worried about her,\" he said of Safadi in the same video.\"I am always worried about him,\" Safadi said in the same video. \"I have fears.\"Khartabil's best friend, Jon Phillips, was also concerned about his safety. A decade earlier, while still a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, Philips had met Khartabil online. The pair bonded over a mutual love of computers, collaborating on projects and meeting regularly at conferences around the world.Phillips remembered their last meeting at a conference in Poland in early 2012, where he implored Khartabil not to return to Syria. His response was \"it's OK, it's OK,\" Phillips recalled.On March 12, 2012, Khartabil disappeared.Safadi embarked on a desperate search for him. Nearly 10 months later, she found him in an overcrowded prison in a Damascus suburb.Khartabil told Safadi that he had been kept in solitary confinement in a military prison for nearly nine months and been tortured daily and starved. A military prosecutor charged him with \"spying for an enemy state.\" There was no trial.He was later transferred to civilian detention where he met a journalist, Wael Saad al-Deen. The two talked every day, kept each other going with discussions of love, poetry and their revolution.Al-Deen fled Syria after being released on bail and is now seeking asylum in Canada.The horrors of Syria's prisons, including torture and deprivation, have been documented. An estimated 60,000 people died while in government detention from 2011 to 2016, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.The Syrian regime has called charges of torture and extrajudicial killings in its prisons \"baseless.\"Although Khartabil was imprisoned, with no prospect of being released, the couple proceeded with the wedding. Safadi's parents came to witness the vows, which the two exchanged through prison bars.With the hashtag #FreeBassel, Phillips launched an international campaign to raise awareness of Khartabil's detention. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales recorded an online video in support. Then-Secretary of State John Kerry called Khartabil a prisoner of conscience.In 2015, almost three years into his arrest, Khartabil disappeared again. He phoned Safadi before the guards took him away. She began searching.Last August, Safadi finally learned the truth: Khartabil had been executed just a few days after he was taken from prison, according to her sources who have seen official documents authorizing the execution.

Why Trump's empty threats don't scare Bashar al-Assad | View","time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  10/04/2018\n","content":"What red line? Why Trump's empty threats don't scare Bashar al-Assad | ViewThere is a dynamic tension in every organization, and even a well-led White House has its flashes of conflict and even chaos. For example, although it was focused intensely on the single objective of winning the Civil War, the Abraham Lincoln presidency was riven with rivalries, jealousies and disorganization. Still, the Trump White House seems to be the textbook example of dysfunction.Fulfilling President Donald Trump's hyperbolic campaign promises has proved to be a very difficult task indeed. Most recently, his pledge to build a border wall funded by Mexico has resulted in essentially the same decision that has been made by previous administrations: sending a few National Guard troops to provide aviation, administration, logistical and intelligence support.But perhaps this administration's most striking inconsistency has been regarding America's role and attitude towards Syria. On March 29, Trump stated unequivocally that he wanted our troops out of Syria \"very soon.\" Meanwhile, several senior officers, including Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who is responsible for the region, noted that in fact \"the hard part, I think, is in front of us, and that is stabilizing these areas, consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes.\"This is not the first time that an extemporaneous pronouncement from Trump has seemed to be at odds with the opinions of senior officials. But never has an administration been so consistently inconsistent on matters of national security.Soon after Trump's comment about leaving Syria, President Bashar al-Assadallegedly gassed to death dozens of Syrians%20with%20what%20is%20generally%20believed%20to%20be%20chlorine) (again). Trump responded by tacitly reneging on his pledge to disengage from Syria and announcing that he was meeting with his generals to discuss \"making some major decisions in the next 24 to 48 hours.\"If history is any guide, it is likely Trump will launch missile strikes against a few Syrian airfields and perhaps at Syrian command-and-control headquarters. After all, this week marks almost exactly one year since Trump launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria in response to another chemical weapons attack. But it is just as likely that Assad will shrug such actions off and carry on with his atrocities, much the same as he has since the insurrection began seven years ago. Assad, Russia and Iran are in it for the long haul, and we are not.So what, if anything, is to be made of the Syrian mess and our role in it? Perhaps it is worthwhile to examine briefly how the United States got to this point in the first place.The U.S. was originally vociferous about its opposition to the Assad regime and publicly supportive of the multifarious forces in rebellion to it. President Barack Obama argued that Assad must resign, and announced that Assad's further use of chemical weapons would not be tolerated. With perhaps a better understanding of American political will than Obama had, however, Assad promptly used chemical weapons again — and America did nothing but complain.Whether or not you agree with an isolationist — at least hands off — foreign policy, it seems clear that nations should not make threats about punishment without the will to follow through.As Russia and Iran became more and more involved in the fray between 2013 and 2015, America became even more skittish. Wanting to keep its hands as clean as possible, the Pentagon's brain trust shifted its objective to eliminating ISIS, which had taken up residence in a country only partially controlled from Damascus.America sent troops to train indigenous Syrian rebel forces, but the greatest battlefield successes were spearheaded by Kurdish allies. Their determination, and America's devastating airpower, proved to be a lethal combination. The dreams of ISIS leaders to occupy territory and create a \"caliphate\" eventually made the organization easier to locate and destroy, and it is now nearly eliminated as a military force in Syria.Now Kurds themselves are being targeted, by Syrian allies Russia and Iran but and also by Turkey — an American NATO ally, in theory at least — which views the Kurds as a terrorist organization. This means that when America does leave Syria, the Kurds will be on their own. Without American forward air controllers and air support, they will have a very unpleasant time.More troubling, ISIS could become a resurgent force in the large swaths of Syria that Assad can't dominate and the U.S. has vacated. In this worst-case scenario, all of our efforts will have been in vain.And Russia and Iran? They have different, but complimentary, objectives. Russia wants influence in the region, but what it really loves is warm-water ports in the Mediterranean. Access via the Black Sea is controlled by the Turks at the Bosphorus, making control of Syrian coastline a tantalizing prospect. America and Turkey are on the outs at the moment, but in a pinch Russia can't trust the Turks to let it through the strait.The perception that America can project its power at will remains a pervasive one stateside — including in Washington. And occasionally it has, for good and ill. But the world has changed dramatically since the war in Vietnam, the Soviet Union dissolved and the U.S. became complacent about its technology and the purity of our democracy.Syria may seem like an underdeveloped country whose fate is not the least bit connected to ours. Perhaps the same is true of Afghanistan or Africa.But don't bet on it._Retired Colonel Jack Jacobs earned the Medal of Honor for exceptional heroism on the battlefields of Vietnam. He also holds three Bronze Stars and two Silver Stars. Jacobs is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a military analyst for NBC/MSNBC.

About 5.5 million Syrians have fled abroad — 95% of them in just five countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt), according to humanitarian groups.Assad's latest offensive is aimed at securing the region around the capital Damascus. The gas attack was in a region just outside the city. Thousands of civilians remained trapped in opposition-held suburbs of Syria's capital Damascus as Assad's government wages a relentless bombing campaign to retake the area.About a third of Syria's housing and half of its educational and medical facilities have been destroyed, according to a 2017 World Bank report. Of Syria's estimated 10 million children, 8.6 million are in dire need of assistance, up from about a half-million after the first year of war. Nearly 6 million children are displaced or living as refugees, and about 2.5 million are out of school. The United States has about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria, based mostly in northeast Syria. Their mission is straightforward: to support local militias fighting the Islamic State. The troops are serving as advisers and providing other support, including air power. The U.S. troops are not in conflict with Assad's armed forces or their Iranian and Russian backers. The U.S. is backing diplomatic efforts to end the conflict but is attempting to fight the Islamic State without taking sides in the civil war.The biggest risk is an attack on Assad's forces that ends up drawing world powers into a global conflict. A year ago the Trump administration authorized a strike on Assad's regime in retaliation for a similar nerve agent attack. The U.S. strike was calibrated so that it would punish the Assad regime without collapsing Assad's government or drawing Russia and Iran into the conflict. The Trump administration may be contemplating a more severe strike this time, but it will need to do so carefully to avoid unintended consequences.The conflict has turned into a proxy war. The United States started arming and providing military air cover in 2014 for anti-Assad rebel groups who were also waging war against ISIS.

The ongoing conflict has already drawn in several other nations, including the United States, Russia and Turkey. Here's a look at competing interests in war-torn Syria:  Israel said it intercepted an Iranian drone that entered its airspace from Syria on Saturday. An Israeli F-16 fighter jet retaliated by attacking targets in Syria, before it was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft fire, injuring the two pilots. It was the first time in more than a decade that an Israeli jet was lost during combat, according to The Jerusalem Post. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the attack Sunday, saying his country delivered \"severe blows to the Iranian and Syrian forces.\"\"We will continue to strike at every attempt to strike at us,\" he told his Cabinet. The powder keg was lit in March 2011, amid the Arab Spring uprisings against autocratic regimes throughout the Arab World. A group in Syria showing their support were arrested and tortured by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, prompting thousands to protest.Assad's forces responded by killing dozens, igniting a full-blown civil war to overthrow the regime. The growing chaos attracted terrorists throughout the region, including remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq and an offshoot that became the Islamic State, or ISIS. By 2014, ISIS militants began seizing large swaths of territory in Syria, including Raqqa as its de facto capital and the oil region Deir ez-Zor, as well as territory in Iraq. A handout photo from the Syrian Arab news agency SANA shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad speaking at a conference in Damascus, Syria, on Nov. 14, 2017. (Photo: SANA handout via EPA-EFE)One by one, foreign countries started getting involved.•The United States wants to root out ISIS.

Iran is Israel’s arch-enemy and has sworn to destroy Israel.

Assad's forces have retaken the cities of Raqqa and Aleppo from ISIS control, although small pockets of fighters still exist in parts of the country.The Pentagon has said ISIS fighters have been cleared from more than 98% of the territory they held at their peak in 2014 and 2015. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in January that the U.S. is committed to keeping a military presence in Syria to make sure ISIS does not regain a foothold. The civil war has killed nearly a half-million people and forced 5 million Syrians to flee, the majority to neighboring Lebanon and Jordan. More than 1 million refugees landed in Europe, contributing to biggest migration crisis since World War II.According to the United Nations, nearly 3 million Syrian children have lived their entire lives gripped by civil war.The civil war has destroyed historic cities such as Palmyra, which ISIS blew up in 2015.Russia is still bombing areas outside Damascus not controlled by the regime.

A collapse of the Assad regime could lead to a political vacuum in Syria and a resurgence of the Islamic State.The terror organization has been driven from most of the territory it held in Iraq and Syria, but pockets of militants remain, and the organization has proved resilient.Asked about concerns in planning a strike on Assad's regime, Mattis cited worry over inadvertently causing civilian casualties and avoiding anything that would trigger a wider war.“On a strategic level, it’s how do we keep this from escalating out of control,” he said.Russia on Thursday warned the U.S. to avoid any steps that could destabilize the situation there. “It’s necessary to avoid any steps that may fuel tensions in Syria,\" said Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added it would have an “utterly destructive impact on the Syrian settlement.” The United States launched cruise missiles at Assad’s armed forces last year after a similar gas attack. The attack destroyed Syrian aircraft but left Assad in power.Mattis sought to assure lawmakers that any attack on Assad would not distract from the administration’s key policy in Syria: the destruction of the Islamic State, or ISIS.“Our role in Syria is the defeat of ISIS,” he said. “We are not going to engage in the civil war itself.”The Trump White House, like the Obama administration it replaced, supports peace efforts to resolve the civil war at the same time it backs local fighters battling the Islamic State. About 2,000 U.S. military personnel are in Syria.“Our strategy remains the same as a year ago: to drive this to a U.N.-brokered peace, but at the same time keep our foot on the neck of ISIS until we suffocate it,” Mattis said.Contributing: David Jackson","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/12/syria-conflict-missile-strike-concerns-islamic-state/511390002/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:30:19.808Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

(Feb. 21)\n    APAirstrikes and shelling by Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces on Damascus suburbs killed nearly 130 people in two days, marking one of the deadliest bombings of the region in three years.  At least 98 people, including 20 children, died Monday in the opposition-held area of eastern Ghouta, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday. More: Syria explained: Why other countries poked their noses in a tiny nation’s civil warWhile the deaths could not be independently verified by USA TODAY, Syrian Civil Defense, a civilian-led emergency response group known as White Helmets,  said some people were still trapped under the rubble.

That wasn’t life,” Barad said.When he was caught criticizing the Syrian government, Barad was arrested, tortured and jailed for two months. When he was released, fighting between rebels and government forces began to escalate.  Again, he packed up his children and fled north, this time just over the Turkish border.Now the war has again encroached on their place of refuge. This time, it’s two allies of the United States — a Kurdish-Syrian rebel group and the Turkish government — slugging it out on the Turkish border.“We don’t want that again, if we have to leave here, we will leave,” Barad said.The latest front in Syria's nearly seven year civil war has not only rattled Turkish border towns hit by rockets and crossfire. It has also further strained relations between Turkey and the U.S. and raised questions about the effectiveness of the U.S. strategy to root out Islamic State militants in Syria. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson laid out a new strategy Jan. 17 in a speech at Stanford University. He committed the U.S. to an open-ended troop presence in northeast Syria. The goals: To fight Islamic State and groups linked to al-Qaeda, counter Iranian influence in the region and get Syria’s President Bashar Assad out of power.The U.S. plan includes further cooperation with Syrian Kurdish militants, something that has infuriated Turkey and sparked its operation against Syrian-Kurdish militants in Afrin.Analysts such as Faysal Itani, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East, doubt whether such an objective is possible.Troops and aid committed to by the Trump administration to Syria are not nearly enough to achieve such lofty goals, Itani said.  Refugee returns would require expensive, large-scale reconstruction and diplomacy will not get Assad to step aside, he said. If the U.S. does not resolve its differences with Turkey over Syria's Kurdish militias, basic stability is even more difficult. The U.S. has not committed enough troops or money to stabilize the country and pave the way for a peaceful democratic transition, Itani said. In addition, the U.S. must navigate the demands of countries on Syria’s borders, such as Turkey, to get regional stability.On Friday, after a two day visit to Ankara by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the two countries agreed to open dialogue in an effort to mend ties damaged by their difference over Kurdish militants in Syria.Tillerson said at a press conference with foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, that Turkey and the U.S. had hit a \"bit of a crisis point in the relationship,\" but that the countries would \"act together from this point forward.\"More: Rex Tillerson says U.S. and Turkey have 'same goals' in Syria. Here's why it mattersStill, no agreement was made to solve the differences between the two countries and Tillerson and Cavusoglu reiterated their conflicting stances.\"Our worries were in direct relation to direct threats that we were receiving about the YPG attacking our citizens, because our people are dying,\" said Cavusoglu, He said around 100 Turkish citizens and Syrians were killed by missiles or by arms coming from Afrin.The battle raging in the northern Syrian region of Afrin pits Turkey, a NATO ally, against the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), a Kurdish-Syrian group supported by the U.S. that has seized control of large swaths of land in Syria from Assad's government.While the U.S. sees the YPG forces as a helpful ally and important part of the Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against Assad and the Islamic State, the Turkish government sees the YPG as part of a troublesome Kurdish separatist group that has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. The Turkish government blames the YPG for the deaths of seven civilians. Scores of others have been injured in more than 100 attacks on southern Turkey. The YPG denies targeting the civilians.An end to tensions between Turkey and the U.S. seems distant because the countries have different priorities, said Hassan Hassan, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. While the U.S. is most concerned with defeating the Islamic State, Turkey is most concern with the YPG, he said.At the same time, the Kurdish fighters of the YPG claim the U.S. isn’t doing enough to defend the YPG in Afrin from Turkish attacks, Itani noted. Recently, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Edogan threatened to attack Manbij, the U.S.-controlled territory in eastern Syria where American troops are stationed alongside Kurdish rebels.That instability in Afrin is creating more refugees. The United Nations says the most recent fighting has displaced between 15,000 and 30,000 people.Syrian refugees like the Barads now account for a third of Reyhanli’s population and they are running out of places to go. Hani Barad’s entire extended family — 12 people — spent two weeks hunkered down in a four-bedroom apartment.Barad’s brother-in-law Mohammed Rahhal stayed there with his mother, Khadija Gazal, 67, after fighting near his own apartment became too loud.“It sounded like explosions all the time and the house was shaking,” said Rahhal, who eventually plans to move to Slovenia to be with his wife. “My mom is scared and doesn’t want to stay there.”Rahhal’s sister Eatimad Rahhal, five months pregnant with her fourth child, missed her last medical appointment and her children were kept home from school. “When planes attack your village, you forget everything and move your children. You come here and hope it stops,” she said.The attacks on Reyhanli and other Turkish border towns have subsided over the past week, but families like the Rahhals remain in limbo — refugees of a war that has no end in sight.  Gazal’s 8 other children and their families are now scattered across the globe. She says she is exhausted. The mortar fire stoked her fears of more displacement and war.  “She wants all her children near her and back together again, she craves this,” her son said. “She wants to forget the hard days and go home.”","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/02/17/families-struggle-find-safety-turkish-border-towns-hit-rockets-and-crossfire/342307002/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:31:34.799Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

There were apparently no casualties and no mistaken hits on Russian forces, and the raid seems to have been a textbook example of a surgical strike. The justified and proportionate action had broad international support and bipartisan political backing inside the United States.The raid was punitive, punishing the Assad regime for conducting illegal and inhuman chemical attacks on civilians. More important, the raid was intended to have a deterrent effect, to convince Syrian decision-makers that it would be unwise to conduct any future such chemical attacks, in which case they would pay an escalating price.It is instructive to compare Friday night’s raid to the 2017 response to Syria’s chemical attack at Khan Sheikhoun. The latest raid used more and varied weaponry, involved more counties, and hit more targets than in 2017. Significantly, the targets were higher up the system — not just aimed at the units that conducted the attacks like in 2017, but at chemical weapons stockpiles, a research, development and testing facility, and a command post. Friday night’s raid even touched the center of the highly defended capital Damascus, telegraphing to the Syrians that they have nowhere to hide.The implicit message to the Assad regime is that if chemical weapons are used again, the response will involve even more weapons and potentially more countries, and hit targets even higher in the system. These could include senior military command and control nodes and government decision-makers. Ultimately, this chain of escalation leads to Bashar Assad himself. If he continues to use chemical weapons, he will have to wonder how many steps there are between the latest raid and one that could potentially put him in the crosshairs.More: Syria's Assad picked the wrong time to launch a chemical attack on civiliansOur View: Syria cries out for American clarity, not chaosThe Damascus regime should reflect on the fundamental disutility of chemical weapons. They are rightly abhorred by the international community. They are of questionable battlefield use, indiscriminate, unpredictable and contaminating, usually employed where fronts are relatively static such as in World War I or the Iran/Iraq War in the 1980s. They are also used as terror weapons, such as during the latter conflict when Iraqi official Ali Hassan al-Majid, aka “Chemical Ali,” used chemical weapons to punish, intimidate and slaughter Kurds who were suspected of disloyalty to Saddam Hussein’s regime. Chemical Ali was later tried by the post-Saddam government and found guilty for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He was executed in 2010.The Assad regime is following the Chemical Ali pattern, employing the weapons against civilians in rebel-held areas and whoever else is in the target zone. So a strong war crimes case can be made, both for the use of the weapons, which is illegal under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and also for the way they are being used, to murder non-combatants. Investigating and documenting these crimes will play an increasingly important role as the military phase of the Syrian civil war winds down and diplomatic efforts ramp up.The Trump administration is eager to restart the United Nations-sponsored Geneva process that will hopefully develop a framework for a more inclusive and democratic post-conflict Syria. In the long run, this is the most important aspect of American involvement in the Syria crisis, since the Trump administration rightly is not seeking to escalate direct U.S. military involvement on the ground. The strike was a limited response to a specific and illegal chemical attack. But the White House has also said that the United States would employ broader elements of national power, particularly economic and diplomatic measures. Friday night’s action should be viewed both as strategic messaging to deter future Syrian chemical attacks, and as part of a broader concept for quickly resolving the civil war on favorable terms. Meanwhile, the Assad regime and its allies have been given an instructive example of the vast capabilities of the multinational forces that were arrayed against them Friday, for one hour in their seven-year war.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77d9a74719c866a1b708cd"},"header":"5 takeaways on Donald Trump's Syria attack: The best choice in a land of lousy options","time":"3:10 AM","content":"\n    The guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey (CG 61) fires a Tomahawk land attack missile from the Arabian Sea.\n    USA TODAYFriday night’s U.S., British and French missile strikes against three sites associated with Syrian chemical weapons will not change the battlefield balance in Syria, bring us closer to ending Syria’s violence, or perhaps even deter Bashar Assad over time from using chemical weapons.What was the logic of the strikes then, particularly in view of the hype and buildup leading up to the attacks. What were they designed to accomplish? And are we now locked into a forever war in Syria?Here are our preliminary takeaways: Perhaps the most important takeaway was that in Trumpland, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis still dominates the decision-making process on the use of military force. If reports that some were pushing for more comprehensive strikes are accurate, then Mattis won this round. No doubt the military participation of the British and French — both of whom were looking for a tough but narrow response that would not trigger Russian and Iranian escalation or drag them into Syria’s civil war, helped strengthen Mattis’ hand. But the secretary was clearly worried about a set of targets that might have triggered Russian and Iranian retaliation. And despite tweets warning Russian leader Vladimir Putin about smart missiles headed his way, Trump took Mattis' counsel. The attack was designed to achieve two limited purposes: First, to punish Assad for his use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians and, second, to deter Assad from launching new chemical weapon attacks by degrading his capacity to conduct such operations. The president and his advisers likely considered a broad range of goals for U.S military response — everything from dealing a crippling blow to the Assad regime’s broader military capabilities, attacking Russian and Iranian forces to fundamentally alter the balance of forces on the ground to change the course of the Syrian civil war, and increasing U.S. leverage to negotiate a comprehensive peace settlement that would force Assad from power. In the end, these ambitious — and riskier — objectives, which would have more deeply enmeshed the United States in Syria’s civil war, were rejected in favor of a more prudent and restrained response that, while larger and more destructive than the U.S. strike a year ago, was focused exclusively on crippling Syria’s chemical weapons infrastructure.It remains to be seen whether the strike will deter Assad from future  chemical weapons use, but it is premature to declare, as the president tweeted this morning, “mission accomplished.” The U.S. military retaliation almost a year ago to Assad’s use of chemical weapons in the city of Khan Sheikhoun did not deter the regime from conducting multiple chlorine gas attacks over the past year. The damage from that attack against aircraft used to deliver such weapons, however, was limited and the targets that were successfully destroyed Friday night — research, development and storage facilities — were central to Assad’s chemical production capabilities. That said, Assad believes he is in an existential struggle for his survival and the survival of his regime, and he is determined to reassert the government’s control over all of Syrian territory. As Trump often says, “We’ll have to see what happens.” More: Donald Trump's textbook surgical strike sent the right message to Syria, Bashar AssadOur View: Syria cries out for American clarity, not chaosIt’s not clear from the Defense Department briefings whether additional U.S. strikes would be used only if Assad uses chemicals again; whether that applies only to the use of certain agents like sarin or to chlorine, which America has largely ignored; and whether the United States might strike pre-emptively if it discovers either preparation for a chemical weapons attack or if intelligence exists on new stockpiles of chemical agents. The logic appears to be that these strikes will set back the Syrian chemical program; that Assad won’t use them again; and that the Russians will pressure him not to do so. None of these assumptions can possibly be substantiated now. And there’s a strong possibility that America may need to “mow the grass” again if/when Assad deploys chemicals again. Critics of this administration and its predecessor have argued that the United States needs a comprehensive policy to end Syria’s civil war, and that Washington must play a leading role in this effort. The reality is that this administration has a policy, but it’s minimalist and is largely focused on two basic objectives: defeating the Islamic State terrorist organization, and deterring Assad from using chemical weapons. We pay lip service to a diplomatic settlement to remove Assad and rebuilding the country. But the inconvenient truths are Assad and his allies have won the war; America lacks the leverage to alter the dynamics of war and peace in Syria; our interest in Syria is not nearly as vital as Assad’s, Russia’s or Iran’s; and the United States is unwilling to take ownership of putting the broken land of Syria back together again. The bottom line, while far from perfect: The Trump administration's response is better than the alternatives in the land of lousy options. This administration, like the last one, has no intention of getting stuck with the check for Syria.Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former State Department adviser and Middle East negotiator, is the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can’t Have (and Doesn’t Want) Another Great President.

Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia had said repeatedly that an immediate cease-fire was unrealistic.The vote was delayed twice on Friday, and the Security Council eventually scheduled a vote for later Saturday. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who did not participate in the cease-fire negotiations, condemned Russia on Friday for \"stalling a vote on a ceasefire.\" Haley asked in the tweet, \"How many more people will die\" before a vote. \"The Syrian people can't wait.\"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Damascus needed guarantees that residential areas would not continue to be attacked by rebel fighters. \"For the resolution to be effective, and we are ready to negotiate such a text, we put forward a principle that will enable the ceasefire to become real and based on guarantees of all those inside Eastern Ghouta and beyond Eastern Ghouta,\" Lavrov said.The powder keg was lit in March 2011, amid the Arab Spring uprisings against autocratic regimes throughout the Arab World. A group in Syria showing their support were arrested and tortured by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, prompting thousands to protest.Assad's forces responded by killing dozens, igniting a full-blown civil war to overthrow the regime. The growing chaos attracted terrorists throughout the region, including remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq and an offshoot that became the Islamic State, or ISIS. By 2014, ISIS militants began seizing large swaths of territory in Syria, including Raqqa as its de facto capital and the oil region Deir ez-Zor, as well as territory in Iraq. The ongoing conflict has drawn in several other nations, including the United States, Russia and Turkey. The civil war has killed nearly a half-million people and forced 5 million Syrians to flee, the majority to neighboring Lebanon and Jordan. More than 1 million refugees landed in Europe, contributing to biggest migration crisis since World War II.According to the United Nations, nearly 3 million Syrian children have lived their entire lives gripped by civil war.The civil war has destroyed historic cities such as Palmyra, which ISIS blew up in 2015.Russia is still bombing areas outside Damascus not controlled by the regime.

He said most of the casualties were women and children.Witnesses told state-run TV that the mortar fell during rush hour in the popular market on the eve of Mother’s Day, celebrated in the Middle East with the start of spring. A child said he was out shopping with his family for Mother’s Day when they heard a huge explosion. “Everyone started running, and people were going into narrow streets to give first aid to others,” the child said.A woman speaking in the hospital said her niece, who was wounded by shrapnel, lost her four-year old son. “We just saw him in the morgue,” the woman told Al-Ikhbariya.

Videos from the White Helmets showed rescue workers surrounded by fires and ongoing shelling struggling to retrieve survivors from a building in Douma.The assault on eastern Ghouta has displaced 45,000 people, the United Nations said Tuesday. Before the latest offensive, it was estimated that 400,000 people were trapped in the besieged region. The rebels first seized the area in 2012,Government forces have made major gains in recent days, leaving just a small fraction of eastern Ghouta under rebel control. President Bashar Assad paid a rare visit to troops on the front lines over the weekend.Syrian and Russian forces have opened a third corridor in eastern Ghouta to allow civilians to leave the town of Harasta, which is home to an estimated 20,000 people. Russia’s Maj. Gen. Vladimir Zolotukhin said 300 civilians and 15 militants have exited through the corridor in the past 24 hours. He said the number of civilians fleeing rebel-held areas has been declining after tens of thousands left in recent days.As in other besieged parts of Syria, government forces have pressed the rebels to enter into local cease-fire agreements under which the militants and their families would relocate to other parts of the country. The Syrian opposition has criticized such agreements, saying they reward the government’s siege tactics and legitimize the forced displacement of civilians from their homes.The Observatory said the Ahrar al-Sham rebel group, which controls Harasta, has reached a cease-fire agreement with the government that will come into effect later Wednesday if there are no violations. Monther Fares, a spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham in eastern Ghouta, said the negotiations are still underway.","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/03/21/death-toll-damascus-market-attack-rises/444752002/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:33:48.993Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Rebels had no unified leadership, and their foreign backers – including the United States – cut support, while the government’s backers increased their support. The rebels have been pushed into a few remaining bastions, and no one remains who is willing and able to topple Mr. Assad.Yet government forces are depleted, leaving Mr. Assad without sufficient troops to clear and hold the entire country. Many pro-government forces are militias that can kill rebels but not reimpose governance. Even in areas nominally under Mr. Assad’s control, foreign backers like Iran and Russia often exercise greater control than the Syrian government.And Mr. Assad’s scorched-earth campaigns have killed hundreds of thousands of people and obliterated cities, destroying the social fabric that could help the country unify. Most recently, he unleashed airstrikes and rockets against a rebel enclave outside Damascus, East Ghouta, killing nearly 100 people.ManbijHasakaAzazAl BabKurdishcontrolAleppoRaqqaIsis controlAth ThawraLand seized from ISIS in Dec. 2017SyriaMayadinIraqPalmyraAbu KamalManbijHasakaKurdishcontrolRaqqaIsis controlAth ThawraLand seized from ISIS in Dec. 2017SyriaMayadinIraqPalmyraAbu KamalHasakaKurdishcontrolIsis controlLand seized from ISIS in Dec. 2017MayadinIraqSyriaAbu KamalThe jihadists of the Islamic State have lost nearly all of the territory that they controlled as a self-proclaimed caliphate. Kurdish-led forces, backed by the United States, pushed them out of their de facto capital, Raqqa, and, along with forces backed by Syria and Russia, have pinned them down to a narrowing band of territory on Syria’s eastern border.But Islamic State fighters have returned to their insurgent roots, hiding out in the desert and emerging to carry out attacks on Syrian government forces and other local forces backed by the United States. As the group’s territory recedes, some analysts believe the jihadists may turn to terrorist attacks and other insurgency tactics.And the Kurds who expelled the Islamic State will not be able to rule majority-Arab areas, opening up power vacuums that set up this part of the country up for the next conflict.TurkishmovementJan. 22TurkeyKobaniTurkishpositionsJan. 21AzazManbijAfrinKurdishcontrolAleppoRaqqaSyriaAth ThawraTurkishmovementJan. 22TurkeyKobaniTurkishpositionsJan. 21AzazManbijAfrinKurdishcontrolAleppoSyriaAth ThawraTurkeyTurkishmovementJan. 22TurkishpositionsJan. 21AzazKurdishcontrolAfrinAleppoSyriaThe array of international combatants has lately created new flare-ups. Turkey has felt threatened by the predominate fighting group to emerge from Syria’s Kurdish minority, which carved out a de facto ministate along the Turkish border amid the chaos of the civil war. In January, Turkey attacked the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, saying it was seeking to root out terrorists.Then, forces loyal to the Syrian government entered Afrin to join Kurdish militias fighting Turkish troops. The government’s move against the Turks and their allied militias threatened to unravel months of diplomatic efforts between Russia, Turkey and Iran to de-escalate the conflict.Kurdish control of territory in northern Syria further complicates a resolution. Mr. Assad will not accept Kurdish control over the long term, and Turkish leaders have talked about possibly striking the Kurds farther east who have been backed by Americans to fight the Islamic State, an action that could lead to conflict between allies.AdvertisementForgot password?Terms of Service Privacy PolicyDon’t have an account?

In the past two years, the government of President Bashar al-Assad, with Russia’s help, laid siege to residential areas of Aleppo, once the country’s second-largest city, and several other areas controlled by opposition groups, leveling entire neighborhoods. Last weekend, dozens of people died in a suspected chemical attack on a Damascus suburb, prompting the United States, Britain and France to launch retaliatory strikes against Syrian targets early Saturday.In addition, American-led forces have bombed the Islamic State in large patches of eastern Syria, in strikes believed to have left thousands dead. And dozens of armed groups, including fighters backed by Iran, have continued to clash, creating a humanitarian catastrophe that the world is struggling to measure.AdvertisementHistorically, these numbers matter, experts say, because they can have a direct impact on policy, accountability and a global sense of urgency. The legacy of the Holocaust has become inextricably linked with the figure of six million Jews killed in Europe. The staggering death toll of the Rwandan genocide — one million Tutsis killed in 100 days — is seared into the framework of that nation’s reconciliation process.Without a clear tally of the deaths, advocates worry that the conflict will simply grind on indefinitely, without a concerted international effort to end it.“We know from conflicts around the world that we can’t have any sustainable peace if we don’t have accountability,” said Anna Nolan, director of The Syria Campaign, a human rights advocacy group. “The most critical thing to understand in that situation is who is being killed and who is doing that killing, and without that information we can’t expect the people involved in resolving this conflict to come to the right decisions.”Until then, local monitoring groups keep the best estimates they can.Fadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said that there were “tens of incidents daily” that raise the death toll, and that monitoring was needed to one day hold perpetrators accountable for potential war crimes.Despite the challenges of access and verification, he sees value in the assessment his group makes, even though he knows they are not perfect.“This work, what we are doing, we are doing this mainly for our people, for our community, for history itself,” Mr. Ghany said. “So we are recording these reports in order to say, on this day, in 2018, these people have been killed and because of this, and in this area.”He believes figures will be vital if peace comes to his country in establishing transitional justice.“We don’t want to lose any one life,” he said.The last comprehensive number widely accepted internationally — 470,000 dead — was issued by the Syrian Center for Policy Research in 2016. The group, which was based in Damascus until that year, was long seen as one of the most reliable local sources because it was not affiliated with the government or aligned with any opposition group.AdvertisementBut now, just getting a death certificate is problematic in Syria, let alone a collective tally of the dead, said Panos Moumtzis, a United Nations assistant secretary general and regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syrian conflict. And civilians make up the largest portion of the death toll.Since there are 18 different authorities issuing documentation, in addition to the government in Syria, Mr. Moumtzis said, many civilians fear that having a death certificate issued by the “wrong authority” could jeopardize their relatives.“Even in death, they worry that one day if they go to declare it they will be in trouble for it,” Mr. Moumtzis said, further complicating tracking.Some monitoring groups are still keeping count from afar, but their numbers vary, are estimates at best, and have not been verified by international groups. These monitors work with networks of contacts in Syria and collect reports on social media and from the news to compile casualty estimates.The most prominent of these groups, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said last month that at least 511,000 people had been killed in the war since March 2011. Many organizations rely on this tally as the best current assessment. The group said in March that it had identified more than 350,000 of those killed by name; the remainder were cases in which it knew deaths had occurred but did not know the victims’ names.Another group, the Violations Documentation Center, which is linked to opposition groups, has a much lower estimate, tallying 188,026 conflict-related deaths from mid-March 2011 until March 2018. But the organization counts just civilian deaths and “takes a considerable amount of details before entering a name onto our database,” Mona Zeineddine, a member of the group, said by email.Mr. Ghany of the Syrian Network for Human Rights said he used tactics similar to those of the Syrian Observatory to track deaths, but his group counts only civilians. In late March, the network said 217,764 civilians had been killed since the beginning of the war.AdvertisementThe complexity of the conflict, the lack of direct access to conflict areas, and the ethnic and political divisions have made accurate counting an immensely challenging task, he said.Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.“In most of the incidents, we are unable to visit the places, and in Syria everyday we have tens of violations,” Mr. Ghany said. “Each year has its own challenges and difficulties, and when you overcome one challenge, we face another.”Members of his group have been detained, and many now live outside Syria. The biggest challenge he now faces is apathy from those on the ground, as the protracted conflict continues.“The people feel now that there is no hope and no need for all of this human rights work and this human rights documentation,” Mr. Ghany said. “Because no one is listening to what we are doing.”Most international experts monitoring the conflict use a general figure of over 500,000 deaths, but acknowledge that changing conditions and restricted access make it impossible to know. Many believe it could be higher.Based on that estimate, which takes into account both civilian and combatant deaths, around 2.33 percent of Syria’s prewar population of 22 million has been killed.At the start of the conflict, many journalists and diplomats had relied on the numbers from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which worked with partners on the ground to tally figures. But the United Nations stopped officially counting in 2014, as the war intensified and became more complex.“It was always a very difficult figure,” a spokesman, Rupert Colville, said at the time. “It was always very close to the edge in terms of how much we could guarantee the source material was accurate.”In early 2016, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said he believed an estimated 400,000 people had been killed. But Mr. de Mistura described it as an unrefined estimate based on earlier figures combined with recent reports of violence.AdvertisementNow, most official communications from the United Nations simply cite “hundreds of thousands killed.”While the numbers vary, all of the groups agree on two things: that the Syrian government is responsible for the majority of the civilian deaths, and that calculating the toll is challenging.“We often talk about these numbers, whether it’s 400,000 or 500,000, but it’s also about the trauma that is behind each of these numbers,” said Mr. Moumtzis of the United Nations. “It has become almost mechanical, the number.”He added: “It’s really just a cold figure, but behind it are lives.”A version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2018, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Officials Have Lost Count of How Many Thousands Have Died in Syria’s War.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77da9e4719c866a1b708e7"},"header":"How the West might strike Syria","time":"\nSaturday 18 August\n","content":"US President Donald Trump vowed Wednesday that missiles would be launched at Syria following a suspected chemical attack, virtually ensuring a military strike against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.The question now becomes what the United States, probably with France and Britain, will hit in war-torn Syria, and what are the risks of escalation and miscalculation with Assad allies Russia and Iran.– What will it target? –The United States and its allies France and Britain want to send a clear and definitive message to Assad that the future use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.One way to ensure Assad cannot use such weapons is to conduct strikes on his chemical infrastructure, including by targeting factories and weapons holding areas.However, such an action carries risks, including the possibility of unintentionally unleashing a cloud of toxic gas into the environment.The strike could also target what is left of Assad’s air force and air defenses, though the delay between Saturday’s attack and an eventual retaliatory strike means he likely will have moved his warplanes to safety.Jennifer Cafarella, a Syria analyst for the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, told AFP that one potential target would be Dumayr military airport northeast of Damascus, from where regime aircraft used in Saturday’s attack may have launched.– How big will the strike be? –Trump last year ordered a strike against Assad following a deadly sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun.The US Navy launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, targeting Shayrat air base, its aircraft, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems and radars.But the strike was limited and designed to not draw America into the chaos of Syria’s bloody civil war.Since then, the regime is alleged to have repeatedly used chlorine and other chemicals, forcing Pentagon planners to consider broader action.Cafarella said the United States must decide how far it wants to go in terms of hitting Iranian proxy forces near US positions in eastern Syria, or even targeting Russian-supported facilities.“The president has publicly stated that he intends to hold not just Assad but his backers accountable as well,” she noted. – How will it be launched? –A strike against Syria will likely come in the form of missiles, as was the case last year.The United States would not want to risk putting manned aircraft over Syrian air defenses — a shoot-down would send the conflict spiralling in unforeseeable new directions. The USS Donald Cook, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, is within easy striking range of Syria, as is a French frigate with its own cruise missiles. These two ships, possibly aided by a US submarine, are likely to play a role in a strike. – What are the risks? –The reaction from Assad backer Moscow is unpredictable and Russia has threatened retaliatory action against the United States if missiles are fired at Syria.The Russian army on Wednesday accused the White Helmets civil defense organization of staging a chemical weapons attack in Douma, where observers say more than 40 people died in a gas attack.NBC News reported Tuesday that Russia has learned how to use GPS jammers to limit the capabilities of US drones operating over Syria. “The US has to be very careful not to accidentally strike Russian targets or kill Russian advisors,” Ben Connable, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation, told AFP.“That significantly limits the number of options available to the United States, because the Russians are embedded in many cases with the Syrians.”Connable warned that if the US accidentally or purposefully kills uniformed Russian soldiers, there would potentially be a dangerous escalation between the two nuclear powers.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the ‘Operation Python Dance III’,... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe’s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

The gory images of alleged victims of the attack had gone viral.  On the eve of the meeting which was ostensibly to discuss the alleged attack and identify its perpetrators,  President Donald Trump found the Syrian Government guilty and threatened retaliatory actions.At  the Council, as usual, debates gave way to acrimony and threats of retaliatory measures even before any investigation. The United States, US, presented its resolution to the meeting pronouncing Syria guilty and seeking the establishment of  an independent agency to investigate the attack. It was vetoed by Russia. Then the verbal cannons were let loose. The U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said: “History will record that, on this day, Russia chose protecting a monster (Syrian President Bashar Assad)over the lives of the Syrian people.” To this, the Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, retorted: “You do not want to hear the fact that no traces of a chemical attack were found in Douma. You simply have been looking for a pretext to justify the use of force against Syria.”He also said:  “We are using the veto in order to protect international rule of law, peace and security, to make sure that you do not drag the Security Council into your adventures.” To which Haley shot back: “Russia has trashed the credibility of the Council. Whenever we propose anything meaningful on Syria, Russia vetoes it. It is a travesty.”After shooting down the American resolution,  the Russians presented their two resolutions which as expected, were defeated. So nothing concrete came out of the Security Council meeting.The basic questions; whether indeed there was such an attack or if the images are part of  ‘fake news,’  could not be answered. Also, no effective mechanism was put in place to determine this or who carried  out the attack and for what purpose. Such tragic matters with potentially  serious consequences, have been reduced to the drama of the absurd since 2014 when then President Barack Obama drew the invisible red line and threatened  to bomb the Assad government out of existence as it did the Libyan government headed by Muammar Ghadaffi in 2011. Such a blind attack might have handed  the terrorist organisations – ISIS and the al-Nusra Front, their first ‘Caliphate’ courtesy of the Americans and their North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, allies.If indeed there was  an attack, is there the remote possibility that it was carried out by a third force; possibly the terrorists or  the Israelis who stand to benefit from a Western attack on Syria? There is the issue of motive; what would be the motive of the Assad government when the war is going so well for it and it is uprooting the last strongholds of the rebels and terrorists especially around Damascus?My argument is not that the Syrian government is incapable of using such deadly chemicals, but there should be a chance of investigating such claims before  conclusions are reached. With the Security Council muddling up the waters, it would be difficult for a neutral body to make a conclusive investigation.Rolling from the drama of massive retaliatory expulsion of  diplomats by Russia and the West  over the use of  nerve gas  against Russian double spy, Sergei Skripal  and his daughter, Yulia in Britain, international diplomacy is being turned into a  dangerous circus where one side may make a false move and the other retaliates.Allegations on the use of deadly bombs have been largely discredited since the  2003 invasion of Iraq under the false pretense that the Saddam Hussein government  not only had weapons of mass destruction, but was about  using them.The Syrian Civil War is supposed to have been a  civil protest against the Assad government; overnight, it became a war in which sophisticated arms are used, giving  the impression that it was not  spontaneous after all. It was in that war that we saw the Western-created, Jordanian-trained and Saudi-funded ISIS in action before it took over vast territories especially in Iraq over which it declared a Caliphate. That was when the founders of the Frankenstein ISIS properly re-designated their monster ‘freedom fighters’ as  terrorists.The Syrian conflict has become a mini World War with the most powerful armies; the Russian and American forces involved as well as the Israeli and Turkish armies and  countless militia including the Lebanese Hezbollah. In the war, Christian minorities have been massacred and enslaved by the terrorists while at least 465,000 of Syrians have been killed, 6.1 million displaced and 5.5 million turned to refugees. The country itself, is one heap of ruins.Perhaps, the group that has proportionally  made the most losses, are the Kurds. They are a homogeneous people sliced into Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria as minorities. When the Iraqi forces which had been decimated by ISIS, was too paralysed, and perhaps, frightened to fight, and Turkey tucked itself into its own side of the borders supporting pockets of Syrian rebels,  it was the small but courageous Kurdish fighters, especially the Peshmerga (those who face death)   that filed out to take on the far superior ISIS forces. With American air support and military supplies, they halted the ISIS and began to push them back in Iraq, while the Syrian military relentlessly pounded them in Syria, forcing them to concede territories.  With the near defeat of ISIS, the war-weary Kurds were abandoned by the Americans, leaving them open to be pounded by Turkey.  America and the West do not want to annoy the Turks who  they are paying to keep illegal immigrants from European shores. They are also aware that the Turks   are being wooed by the Russians even after downing a Russian fighter jet. The Kurdish Question does not fit into the Western agenda; the Kurds were simply a sacrificial lamb.There are no concerted efforts to end the bloody Syrian Civil War because  the West knows that it will be a victory for the Syrian government; so, international  power brokers concentrate on negotiating territories, ‘humanitarian corridor’ ‘safe passage’ for  rebels and their families and ceasefire to allow evacuation of besieged cities.On March 29, Trump announced   he would be  withdrawing American troops from Syria: “We’ll be coming out of Syria like very soon. Let the other people take care of it now.” This has been replaced this week with the heightened rhetoric of further American military intervention in that country.  If  the Americans strike, and the Russians refuse to be bystanders,  Syria may provide the world with a highway to universal conflagration. Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the ‘Operation Python Dance III’,... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe’s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

A total of 2.7 million people lost their jobs, affecting 11 million who depended on them.Geographically, joblessness was said to be highest in the northeast, in Hasakeh and Raqa provinces, reaching 65 percent in the latter.Fourth quarter private consumption plunged 25.5 percent from a year earlier, with spending focused almost exclusively on food and, for the almost 45 percent of people who have fled their homes, on rent.And that has been made all the more difficult by an astronomical 178 percent rise in prices since 2011.GDP has fallen by 41 percent since the crisis began, equivalent to a loss of $70.9 billion (52.1 billion euros).At the same time, the structure has altered sharply, with most of GDP now represented by domestic trade and government services, while agriculture and industry have slumped.At the same time, military spending has soared from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 15.9 percent last year.The educational system was said to be on the verge of ruin, with 4,000 schools destroyed, damaged or being used to house the internally displaced.The report said that, nationwide, just over half (51.8 percent) of school age children were not going to school. But that figure reached 90 percent in Raqa and Aleppo provinces, and 68 percent in the Damascus provincial countryside.As for the healthcare infrastructure, the report said 61 out 91 public hospitals had been damaged, and 45 percent of them were out of service altogether.The sector has been further hit by health care personnel fleeing or being killed and by the collapse of the nation’s pharmaceutical industry.The report said the overall death toll at the end of 2013 was 130,000, a figure rising to 520,000 if the wounded and maimed were added.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the ‘Operation Python Dance III’,... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe’s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dadc4719c866a1b708ed"},"header":"Syria denies using chemical weapons in civil war","time":"\nSaturday 18 August\n","content":"Syria on Monday denied ever using chemical weapons in its four-year-old civil war, telling a global watchdog it was cooperating fully with the destruction of its toxic stockpile.Damascus’s rebuttal comes amid growing accusations it is not being transparent with the world’s chemical watchdog and as United Nations efforts are stepped up to track down the perpetrators of deadly chlorine gas attacks in the war-torn country last year.“We wish here to state categorically that we have never used chlorine or any other toxic chemicals during any incidents or any other operations in the Syrian Arab Republic since the beginning of the crisis and up to this very day,” Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Moqdad told the annual meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).Damascus rejected “the false accusations against Syria with respect to its supposed use of chlorine as a weapon in military operations,” he added, speaking in Arabic through an interpreter.The accusations “only serve political agendas, which also aim at diverting our successes in eliminating our chemical weapons,” Moqdad said.But Western countries including the United States and Canada, as well as the European Union, have lambasted Syria, raising doubts about whether President Bashar al-Assad’s regime is truly committed to ridding his country of all chemical arms.There are “many uncertainties regarding the dismantling of Syria’s chemical weapons programme, notably the gaps and contradictions contained in Syria’s declarations,” EU representative Jacek Bylica told the meeting in The Hague, attended by delegates from the OPCW’s 192 states.“These uncertainties lead to doubts as to compliance by Syria with its obligations under the Convention,” Bylica said at the opening of the five-day assembly.Last week the OPCW itself voiced “grave concern” at the continued use of toxic arms in Syria, despite the regime’s ratification of the UN Convention banning chemical weapons.The OPCW investigations did not directly blame any of the parties in the four-year civil war, aimed at ousting Assad and in which civil groups say more than 250,000 people have been killed.French ambassador Laurent Pic told delegates some reports indicated the presence of helicopters at the time of chemical attacks.“We all know what that means: the pursuit of relentless oppression by any means, including the most abominable, by a criminal regime against its own people.”The OPCW — which won the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize — confirmed earlier in November with “utmost confidence” that mustard gas was used in Syria in August during fighting between rebels and jihadists, and “likely” killed a child.OPCW experts also concluded that chlorine gas was likely used in an attack in Idlib province in March.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said a joint UN task team, approved by the Security Council in August to probe chlorine attacks in Syrian villages last year, was up and running in New York and in The Hague “with plans to set up in Damascus.”The panel, which comprises 24 experts, is expected to deliver its first report to the Security Council in February, Uzumcu said.The watchdog’s top official told Monday’s meeting “significant progress” had been made in destroying Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile.Under a deal hammered out in 2013 between Russia and the United States following a sarin gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in which hundreds died, the regime joined the UN Convention against chemical weapons and pledged to hand over all such arms to the OPCW for destruction.Some 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons were handed over by Syria, including mustard and sarin gas.The last of the stockpile will be destroyed in the United States by the end of the year, Uzumcu said.But Canadian ambassador Sabine Nolke said: “More than two years after acceding to this treaty, Syria has failed to demonstrate that it deserves treatment similar to that of any other ordinary member.”Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the ‘Operation Python Dance III’,... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe’s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

We hope to fulfil the dream of reaching the World Cup. It’s the dream of every Syrian, every member of our team, whether the players, coaches, officials.”Syria, ranked 75th, have never reached the World Cup before and they needed Soma’s injury-time equaliser against Iran last month to take them into the Asian play-offs.Soma’s breakaway goal to make it 2-2 in the 93rd minute in Tehran left an excited Syrian TV commentator sobbing with happiness as he shouted his celebrations for two minutes.– Assad T-shirts –But the team is not without controversy, backed as it is by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, who remains in power despite a conflict which has since killed more than 320,000 people and displaced millions.When Syria played in Singapore in the early stages of qualifying, former head coach Fajr Ibrahim and midfielder Osama Omari fronted a press conference wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the image of a smiling Assad.Al-Soma and al-Khatib had been absent since voicing their support for the rebels fighting Assad’s forces, but their return this year under al-Hakim has galvanised the Qasioun Eagles.Al-Soma is rated as one of Asia’s best strikers, while fellow marksman Omar Khribin bagged a hat-trick for his Saudi club, Al Hilal, in their 4-0 win over Iran’s Persepolis in the first leg of their AFC Champions League semi-final.“Everyone knows the scope of the tragedy that our country is enduring, and which is reflected in all aspects of life, including sports,” al-Hakim said. “It’s difficult for us to hold training camps abroad, or hold high-level friendly and warm-up matches. “Arab and foreign experts predicted that we will be the weakest team in our group… All of these factors have had a positive impact on us. It nourished a defiant spirit, and we worked on the players’ psyche to fill the gaps of proper preparations and other things.”Syria start as second-favourites against Australia, who have played the last three World Cups and reached the last 16 in 2006, losing controversially to eventual winners Italy.The Socceroos missed out on automatic qualification on goal difference alone but they will be without their midfield talisman Mile Jedinak and have shown enough defensive frailty to give Syria hope. “It’s a tough face-off with a strong Australian team known for its professional players and a style that differs from any team we have already faced,” al-Hakim said.“I’m studying all their details to figure out the way we have to deal with them… mistakes are not allowed here, and although the Australian team is strong, we are used to facing the big teams, and are no longer afraid of playing away matches. “There is no impossible in football and we have proven that… we have a chance to beat Australia.”Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the ‘Operation Python Dance III’,... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe’s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77db2b4719c866a1b708f5"},"header":"Trump warns Russia may pay for Syria attack on civilians","time":"\nSaturday 18 August\n","content":"President Donald Trump warned on Monday that Moscow, Tehran and Damascus may be forced to pay a “big price” after the latest alleged chemical weapons atrocity of the Syrian civil war.\nThe American leader met with his cabinet and promised that “major decisions” would be made within the next 24 to 48 hours, amid mounting speculation about a US military response.The United Nations Security Council, meanwhile, met in New York after Washington urged the international community to approve an investigation into the alleged attack on rebel-held Douma, which reportedly killed at least 40 people.Earlier, Trump had condemned what he said had been a “heinous attack on innocent” Syrians, after reports emerged of women and children choking to death in agony, adding: “This is about humanity — it can’t be allowed to happen.”Asked whether Russia’s President Vladimir Putin bore some of the responsibility for the latest attack to be blamed on his ally Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Trump said: “He may, and if he does it’s going to be very tough.“Everybody is going to pay a price. He will. Everybody will,” he said.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later made the warning even more explicit, saying: “The president has noted that Russia and Iran also bear responsibility for these acts since they would not be possible without their material support.”– Chemical watchdog –On April 7, 2017, almost exactly a year ago, Trump ordered the US Navy to target a Syrian airbase with cruise missiles in the wake of a similar attack that the UN chemical weapons watchdog OPCW later pinned on Assad’s regime.But the stakes in any similar punitive strike could now be higher, with Putin warning against any “provocation and speculation on this matter.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had earlier claimed that Russian specialists found no trace of a chemical attack in Douma, the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus.And Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested that rebels could have staged the attack themselves to pin the blame on Damascus.But Washington’s main European allies stood by reports blaming Assad. France’s President Emmanuel Macron has promised a “strong, joint response” and Britain has joined a growing chorus demanding action.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke by telephone with acting US secretary of state John Sullivan and, according to London, they agreed that “this attack bore hallmarks of previous chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime.”With Washington and Paris expected to respond, an apparent Israeli strike on a Syrian regime air base early Monday initially raised speculation that US punitive raids had begun.Tehran later confirmed that four of its personnel were killed in the strike, underlining the international nature of the conflict and the risk of escalation if and when the West takes action.– Investigation launched –Rescuers and medics in Douma say more than 40 people died after an alleged poison gas attack late Saturday in the last rebel-held pocket of the one-time opposition stronghold of Eastern Ghouta.Access to the area, which has faced weeks of regime bombardment, is limited and AFP has not independently verified the accounts.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was investigating the allegations but that so far only a “preliminary analysis” had been carried out.Since February 18, Syrian regime forces have been carrying out an offensive against Ghouta that has killed more than 1,700 civilians and left Islamist rebels cornered in their last holdout of Douma.After capturing most of Ghouta, Syria and Russia secured two negotiated withdrawals last month that saw 46,000 rebels and civilians evacuate. Following fraught negotiations and a concentrated regime bombing blitz, state media on Sunday announced a deal was reached for Jaish al-Islam to leave Douma within 48 hours and release hostages.Several buses of detainees arrived in Damascus overnight after having been freed by Jaish al-Islam, and rebels were being evacuated in a parallel operation on Monday, SANA said.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Wings of Rescue Limited Partners With ExpertChikitsa to Bring Indian Doctors to Ibadan to Perform Orthopaedic and Neurol...RelatedTHE Nigerian Army yesterday said it will soon commence its annual training programme, the ‘Operation Python Dance III’,... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESMajor Abraham Eghagha got me thinking about President Nnamdi Azikiwe’s role in the January 15, 1966 military interventio...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

Let the other people take care of it now,” Times of Israel quoted him as saying.Trump did not say who the others were who might take care of Syria, but Russia and Iran have sizable forces in the country to support President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.“Very soon — very soon we’re coming out. We’re going to have 100 percent of the caliphate, as they call it — sometimes referred to as ‘land’ — taking it all back quickly, quickly,” he said.“But we’re going to be coming out of there real soon. Going to get back to our country, where we belong, where we want to be.”The United States has more than 2,000 military personnel in eastern Syria, working with local militia groups to defeat the Islamic State group while trying to keep out of Syria’s broader civil war.Trump’s eagerness to quit the conflict flies in the face of a new US Syria strategy announced in January by then secretary of state Rex Tillerson — who has since been sacked.Tillerson argued that US forces must remain engaged in Syria to prevent IS and Al-Qaeda from returning and to deny Iran a chance “to further strengthen its position in Syria.”Later in a speech at Stanford University, he also warned that “a total withdrawal of American personnel at this time would restore Assad and continue his brutal treatment against his own people.”“We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East. And you know what we have for it? Nothing,” Trump declared, promising to focus future US spending on building jobs and infrastructure at home.US warns Nigerian leaders, clerics against religious crisisTrump, Obama, Clinton react to Aretha Franklin’s deathUS gives update on suspended visa services in AbujaLaLiga to play league fixtures in USNASS siege: What UK, US, EU others should do to sponsors of invasion – Timi FrankIsha Sesay exits CNN over Trump coverage, speaks on Chibok girlsCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2018/03/30/us-leaving-syria-nothing-show-7trn-spent-middle-east-trump/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:39:41.069Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

These claims have been unsubstantiated. Just one month ago Carla Del Ponte, a member of the U.N. Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria concluded that it was the rebel forces inside Syria that had in fact used chemical weapons. The U.N.’s findings were supported by medical staff and victims after a recent chemical attack. So why the sudden rush to judgement? Is the White House ”highly confident” of the chemical weapons narrative because it provides easier access into Syria and to it’s oil and gas reserves?”This is indeed the question of the century when it comes to the crisis in Syria.The G8 is meeting in Northern Ireland on 17th June 2013 in an attempt to agree on what to do concerning the Syrian civil war. The world is watching with deep concern as the conflict widens and different countries are beginning to take different sides. I urge the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and Hezbollah to stand firmly against the reckless adventurism of the Americans, the British, the French, the Saudis and the Turks in Syria. To arm the Syrian islamists and rebels, the majority of whom hate ethnic minorities, secularists, moderate muslims and christians and who kill those that do not share their narrow and primitive world view is utter madness. Bashir Al Assad will NEVER be removed by force and the secular state of Syria where ethnic minorities and those who share other faiths are protected will never fall. The British, the French, the Americans and their allies will not achieve their objectives in this conflict despite all their lies and disinformation about what Al Assad is supposed to have done and is supposed to be doing.I do not believe for one minute that Al Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people- rather I believe that it is the rebels, armed by the western powers, the Turks and the Saudis, that are doing so to those that are supporting Al Assad. For once the world must not be fooled with lies and they must stand up against the traditional bullies of the world, those that believe in regime change and those that destabilise and destroy the nations of others for economic and pecuniary gain.I do not blame Al Assad for the 90,000 people that have been killed in Syria since this conflict began but instead I blame the western powers, their allies and the Syrian rebels who are actually arming encouraging and funding Al Qaeda islamist fighters to lead the fight in the battle against Al Assad. How Barak Obama can stomach the stench of those that slit the throats of so-called ”unbelivers” and commit these atrocities and actually fund and support them I don’t know.Yesterday it was Iraq, Egypt and Libya. Today it is Syria. Tomorrow it will be Lebanon and Iran. After they have finished with the Middle East they will take the battle to the gates of Russia and China. And of course one day it will be the Sudan, Nigeria and Somalia. Their lust for power and determination to control the entire world is insatiable and it has no end. It is time for people to wake up and stop being taken in by their evil lies and disinformation which is being churned out on a daily basis by the international news networks which they control. It is time for the world to wake up and say “enough is enough”. It is time for the truth to prevail.Oh Lord Jesus return soon and save this world from the evil of those that seek to rule it and wipe out your counsel in the name of the devil. These people are the natural enemies of all believers whether they be christian, jewish or muslim. They do not believe in God. They believe in the power of the devil, the gods of the New Age, the usage of money, brute force, murder, disinformation, lies and deceit. They are the agents of the Illuminati who seek to establish a one world government and a new world order where no monotheic religion and no faith has any relevance and where the Living God is relegated to the background and is described as a powerless relic of history.It is the duty of every believer, whether christian, muslim or jewish, to resist their evil and their desire to control and dominate the world and its resources. May God open the eyes of the people of the world to their evil and to their sheer callousness and greed. Satan works through them and he seeks to enslave us all by empowering and enthroning them. They have all the power, all the armies, all the money, all the media houses, all the international television networks, all the satellite and space-based spying systems and all the sophisticated telecommunication networks. They control virtually everything on the earth. Yet we have God, who never sleeps and who has never lost a battle.In the end His counsel alone will stand, His will shall be done, His purpose shall be established and His name will be glorified. Even if they kill half the world’s population in their evil quest, at the end of the day the righteous shall be vindicated and the truth shall prevail because God is with us. I weep when I see the innocents that are slaughtered on a daily basis in Syria. I cry when I see children being beheaded and blown apart and when I see the bodies of women being mutilated. I groan when I see deranged and callous men doing the will of America and destroying their own beautiful country and heritage for no just cause. I shudder when I see so-called rebels hacking their compatriots to pieces and eating their hearts and organs with joy.Vladimir Putin’s words to David Cameron during their joint press conference at 10 Downing Street after a meeting on 16th June are instructive. He said ”I think you will not deny that one does not really need to support the people who not only kill their enemies, but open up their bodies, eat their intestines, in front of the public and cameras. Is it them you want to supply with weapons?”. These are wise words indeed and a legitimate question. We should all take a little time out to ponder on them. Another interesting contribution came from the respected American war hero General Wesley Clark who was the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe during the Kosovo war. He said that America had drawn up plans to invade Iraq, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Iran as far back as 2001 just a few days after the attack on the Twin Towers in New York on 9/11. It follows that what we are witnessing in Syria today is a script that was written many years ago and which is being effected with ruthless determination and clinical precision. No matter how long it takes and regardless of the cost in terms of loss of civilian lives and the shedding of innocent blood those that believe that it is their manifest duty and destiny to rule and dominate the entire world are determined to effect their sinister purpose and evil agenda and bring Syria down to her knees. This, surely, is not only a travesty of justice but it also a tragedy of monuemental proportions.Yet the American-made Shakespearean tragedies of the Middle East just keep on unfolding. Let us go back a little. According to George Galloway, the utterly irrepressable, exceptionally intelligent and deeply courageous British Member of Parliament for Bradford, no less than one million Iraqi people, mainly women and children, died as a direct consequence of the economic sanctions and the ”oil for food” programme that the west imposed on Iraq when Saddam Hussein was still in power. Yet it didn’t stop there. When Iraq was eventually invaded and Baghdad was carpet-bombed by George W. Bush’s and Tony Blair’s ”coalition of the willing” in 2003 no less than 150,000 Iraqi civilians, again mainly women and children, were slaughtered like flies within the space of just a few days. What a terrible price that had to be paid for the sheer mess that we have in Iraq today where the minority sunni muslims are waging an all out jihad against the majority shia. That is the kind of carnage, confusion and mayhem that America and her allies are spreading all over the Middle East and it appears that Syria is in the process of being consummed by it and of sparking off a major regional conflict which is drawing in many other countries. This beleagured nation has been turned into a blood-soaked arena and a blood-drenched theater for a proxy war which is bound to spread to the neighbouring Arab countries. What an utter shame.Yet like David Icke, Naom Chomsky, Alex Jones, Norman G. Finkelstein, George Galloway and millions of other deep thinkers and great minds from all over the world I stand with the Syrian people and the legitimate government of their sovereign and independant state at this difficult time. I believe that no matter what the agents of satan say or do God shall defend their noble cause and He shall vindicate them and deliver them from the evil that stalks the world and that seeks to take control of their land.Permit me to end this contribution with some interesting questions that were put by Yele Odofin Bello, who is a Nigerian Canadian and who has captured the mood of the moment rather well. He wrote, ”why would the west arm rebels in Syria against a recognised government whilst they did the exact opposite in Colombia and Sri Lanka? Who decides what is evil and what is not? And what yardstick do we use to make these determinations? Why should Iran stay on the sideline when the Saudis and other despotic Arab regimes support rebels in this conflict? I still maintain that objective journalism died in 2007. The BBC, CNN and other western media houses continue to claim that Al Assad has ‘killed over 92,000 of his own people’. Does it mean that all those casualties were rebels and civilians? Why is the western press so eager to marginalise the Syrian Army by referring to them as ‘regime forces’ or ‘Assad forces’?” The answers to these pertinent and insightful questions are self-evident.Thankfully there are a number of inflluential voices in the west and particularly in the United Kingdom that are also of the view that arming the Syrian rebels would be a fatal mistake. Boris Johnson, the flamboyant Mayor of London, is one of those voices. He said ”arming the Syrian rebels would be disasterous because Britain would be pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs”. He also warned David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, that he ”should not use Syria as an arena for muscle-flexing” and that ”any weapons sent to the rebels could end up in the hands of Al Qaeda”. This is wise counsel from a deeply concerned Tory party colleague and the Prime Minister would do well to accept it. Other British leaders that have voiced their opposition and expressed deep concerns about supplying arms to the rebels include Dr. John Sentamu (the Archbishop of York), Lord Dannat (the former head of the British Armed Forces), Julian Lewis (a leading backbench Tory MP) and Nick Clegg (the Deputy Prime Minister). Let us hope that these saner voices prevail in what is turning out to be a deeply disturbing narrative.God bless the people of the Syrian Arab Republic.Copyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2013/06/17/femi-fani-kayode-the-syrian-rebels-or-the-syrian-beasts/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:39:56.439Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

War is a very bad business. It is costly, deadly and ruinous, even for a supposedly winner.“It is worse for the loser. Indeed, all are losers in a war. The resources, human and material, used to prosecute wars could have been used for the development of the people. The lesson of history is that nations and people emerged from wars weakened, devastated, poor and vulnerable.“The worst part is that though a nation’s decision to go to war or not may be easy before the outbreak of hostilities, it is more difficult and sometimes impossible to decide to stop a war; thus we have prolonged and sometimes an indeterminate war. This is the hard part.“We see the devastations of war in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon (and closer home) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. While some like Liberia and Sierra Leone are fortunate to put the war behind them, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq have found it difficult to stop their own wars.”The governor, however, urged Nigerian youths to apply their education in solving problems facing humanity.‘Don’t kill the best state university in Nigeria’ – ASUU tells Govs. Ajimobi, AregbesolaLAUTECH: Why Govs. Ajimobi, Aregbesola must resign – ASUUWhat we did to Biafran soldiers during the civil war – Gen OnojaLai Mohammed reveals what will lead to another civil war in NigeriaPay us to save future of 30,000 LAUTECH students – Workers tell Ajimobi, AregbesolaBode George warns Buhari against another civil war, tells Saraki, Dogara what to doCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2018/01/16/nigerians-unwittingly-pushing-towards-another-civil-war-gov-aregbesola/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:40:11.816Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Prime Minister David Cameron has been badly humiliated and this is a great triumph for Ed Milliband, the Leader of the Opposition. Kudos to my friend Mr. George Galloway MP for his brilliant and stirring speech on the floor of the House of Commons on this issue. I must confess that the only speech that has moved me as much as Galloway’s in recent times was the riveting and spell-binding speech delivered by the Irish MP, Mrs.Clare Daly, on the floor of the Irish Parliament where she described President Barack Obama as a ”war criminal” and a ”murderer of children”. People like Galloway and Daly are amongst those that I would describe as today’s ”servants of truth” and history and posterity will be very kind to them regardless of the contempt, anger, insults and ridicule that they have been subjected to by the retrograde forces of conservatism that presently control the world.The resolution of the British Parliament not to go to war in Syria gives us hope that sanity may eventually prevail in a world that has proved to be increasingly insane. Yet sadly it appears that France and America are as eager to go as ever. As the assault on Syria is about to start and the carnage is about to begin please take note of the following words- the biggest mistake that President Barack Obama will make in his distinguished political career and in his Presidency is to strike Syria on the false and contrived premise that President Bashir Al Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people.What we are witnessing today is the laying of the foundation and the planting of the seeds for what will eventually be World War 3. I am not suggesting that the military strike on Syria will witness the beginning of World War 3. What I am saying is that it will lay the foundation for it. I believe that the war itself will come at a much later stage and probably long after both Obama and Russia’s President Vladimer Putin have both left office. However the military action that America is about to embark on in Syria will be the first step on the road to that terrible final conflict. After they have struck Syria nothing will be the same again and we shall finally be on that long-awaited conflict-ridden slippery slope to Armageddon. And after that war has been fought and won historians will have cause to say that the brutal, unjustifiable, indefensible and illegal attack by Obama’s America and her allies on Syria is where and when the die was finally cast. They will say that that is when the Americans finally crossed the line of no return, of no fear and of no shame. They will say that that is when the Americans should have been stopped.Nothing describes the frightful situation that we are faced with today in the Middle East better than the words of Mr. Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, when he said, just a few days ago, that ”the west handles the muslim world like a monkey handles a grenade”. The events and bloody carnage that we are about to witness being unleashed by America and her allies on Syria, a relatively small country of 22 million people, will be so brazen, so vicious, so chilling and so ruthless that for the first time in world history Russia, Iran and China will come together, finally pick up the gauntlet and muster the courage to say ”no more” to American lawlessness, manipulation, deceit, double standards and butchery. At that point there will be no going back and, slowly but surely, one thing will lead to another in the Middle East and the conflict will spread until the final conflagration comes. The truth is that just as Shakespeare wrote in his famous play “Julius Caesar” over 400 years ago, in the world today “Caeser has crossed the Rubicorn, war is inevitable”.Yet many have bought into and wholeheartedly accepted the American propaganda that Al Assad has used chemical weapons against his own people. It is in the same way that they bought into the propaganda that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons that he was about to use against his own people and the rest of the world. They bought into that propaganda just as they bought into the propaganda that 911 was carried out by Osama Bin Ladin, just as they bought into the propaganda that Muammar Ghaddafi was a monster that was about to kill all his people, just as they bought into the propaganda that Obama was the Messiah who wanted to spread democracy in the Middle East, just as they bought into the propaganda that Hosni Mubarak had to be removed to bring stability to Egypt, just as they bought into the propaganda that Tunisia would be better off with an islamist President, just as they bought into the propaganda that Iran is evil, just as they bought into the propaganda that the Saudis are angels, just as they bought into the propaganda that Israel can do no wrong, just as they bought into the propaganda that there was no coup in Egypt, just as they bought into the propaganda that Hamas must not be recognised, just as they bought into the propaganda that Hezbollah are terrorists and just as they bought into the propaganda that Lebanon did not deserve to be stable and must be nothing more than a weak and crisis-ridden buffer-state which exists at their pleasure.I suggest that those that have bought into all this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical propaganda take the time out to listen to what the distinguished and respected American General Wesley Clark (the man who had the distinct privilage and honour of leading the NATO forces in Europe during the attack on Slobodan Milosovitch’s forces in Serbia and Belgrade in the 90’s) said in 2007 about America’s intentions in the Middle East and about how those plans had been hatched as far back as 2001. He claimed that just two weeks after 911 America had taken the decision to remove the leaders of no less than 7 Middle Eastern countries by any means necessary in order to fully secure of the Middle East. He actually listed those countries, Today, and for the last 5 years, we are bearing witness to everything that he said would happen and those things are unfolding before our very eyes. It is only the dull, the shallow and the naive that can possibly deny this. Clarks’s tape can be found on youtube for those that doubt what I have said.Finally let me make two two points. Firstly there is absolutely NO evidence to suggest that it was Al Asssad’s forces that actually used the chemical weapons that were unleashed on the civilian population in Syria the other day and it could well have been the rebels that did it. The fact that Assad’s troops were also affected by those weapons tells me a lot. No sane leader poisons his own soldiers with sarin gas. And he certainly does not do so on his own doorstep, on the day that international weapons inspectors arrive in his country and in the middle of a war which he is on the verge of winning. Secondly the fact that America and her allies have decided not to go through the U.N. Security Council on this matter makes whatever action they take against Al Assad and Syria manifestly illegal. It violates every rule of international law and it creates yet another bad precedent.The resolve by America not to go through the UN Security Council before doing anything creates the greatest problem of all. Who appointed America as the policeman of the world and who annointed her as the spokesman for the international community? The Security Council was established to stop and prevent precisely the type of cruel, illegal and arbitary use of power that the American government is about to indulge in and unleash on Syria. No country should be allowed to play God and when they choose to do so they must be told clearly and categorically that they are operating outside the law. The truth is that America has gone beserk and the power it wields today has caused many that are in positions of authority over there to be reckless, arrogant and delusional. There is an evil agenda that is unfolding before our very eyes which many people that are not discerning, bright or knowledgeable enough can possibly recognise or appreciate. Many have argued that the rebels could not have launched the chemical attack because they did not have the heavy weapons, the know-how or the capabilities to do so. This is hogwash. The Syrian rebels can do anything and muster or use any kind of heavy weapons as long as their American, French, Saudi and Turkish friends are ready to help them. That is the bitter and ugly truth.The fact that the rebels are led by brutal cannibals and Al Qaeda islamists and that the American government is in an unholy alliance with such beasts tells me everything that I need to know. The American government is ready to get into bed with even the devil and do just about anything to get rid of or discredit Al Assad, including turning a blind eye to the use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians by those rebels and then blaming it on the Assad regime. I for one do not believe for one minute that Al Assad used chemicals weapons. The fact that the Syrian rebels are killing christians and secularist muslims in droves and that they wish to establish an islamic fundamentalist state on the borders of Israel also tells me that those that support such people are misguided individuals that do not care for muslims, christians or jews. The Americans are effecting the agenda of satan, pure and simple. They should go ahead and use their power. We know that nothing and no-one will stop them. They should satisfy their blood-lust and kill as many people as they like in Syria. They should remove as many governments and conquer as many nations as they choose in the Middle East and elsewhere. They should take as much oil as they like. They should do as they please and establish their ”new world order”. One day God will rise up and avenge the weaker nations of the world whom they have manipulated, discredited, cheated and destroyed. They should revel in the moment and enjoy the killings and carnage that they are about to unleash. However the one thing that they shall not do is to compel those of us that are discerning enough to see through their lies, their greed and their wickedness to clap for them and sit back silently as they slaughter the world and impose their values. All we can do is create awareness about their evil agenda to those that care to listen. And we shall continue to do so whether they like it or not.One day the good people of American themselves will understand that they have been deceived by their own governments. American governments and American Presidents are simply puppets and middle-ranking representatives of a much greater force that seeks to destroy mankind and control the entire world. All you need to do is to be a student of eschatology to appreciate this. The assumptions that many have made about what is true and what is not true in Syria and elsewhere are simply wrong. Yes chemical weapons were used and many people, including innocent women and children, were killed but the question is who by, who gave the order and what was the motive and purpose for such a heartless act? In the May 6th edition of the Washington Times newspaper it was reported that Mrs.Carla Del Ponte, the former International Court For Criminal Justice prosecutor and a respected member of the United Nations Independant International Commission Of Inquiry On Syria told Swiss TV that ”there were strong concrete suspicions that Syrian rebels that were seeking to oust Al Assad had used the nerve agent sarin”. This honest Canadian lady certainly seems to know what is really going on but who is listening to her? One day the American people will open their eyes to the evil and manifest injustice that their governments, particularly Obama’s government, have inflicted on the people of the Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan and north Africa. Until then we shall sit back and watch American forces kill perhaps as many Syrians as they did in the first few days of the bombing of Baghdad when they snuffed out 150,0000 innocent Iraqi souls, including women and children. I hope that they can sleep well at night when this happens. The blood of those innocent souls is as much on the hands of those hapless cheerleaders that believe everything that they are told by the international television networks and that defend or seek to justify this abominable action as it is on those who actually ordered and executed it.Permit me to end this essay with an interesting contribution from a deeply courageous and insightful englishman by the name of Mr. David Icke. He said-”these genetic liars are so desperate to bomb the Assad regime into history. This is because the global plan to subvert and conquer the Middle and Near East has had its timetable scuppered by the Syrian Government’s refusal to fall in the wake of a civil war. That civil war was orchestrated through psychopathic mercenaries by the hidden forces behind NATO. Those forces are now planning to bomb Syria via their political puppets who dare not refuse to take orders – not that this lot need much encouragement. They are planning to kill and maim even more people with brown faces on their way to controlling the whole of the vast region known as Eurasia. The plan was for them to have invaded Lebanon and Iran by now so they are seeking to bomb away the blockage and stalemate in Syria where the NATO armed-and-funded ‘rebels’ have been losing ground to the Assad military. To do so, they are claiming with no evidence, that Assad ordered a chemical attack on his own people. They have tried this before without success when it became clear that the alleged ‘Assad’ chemical attacks were instigated by the very ‘rebels’ that NATO controls to manufacture an excuse for NATO to invade. Now, in pathetic desperation, they are doing the same thing again and this time refusing to take no for an answer or produce any credible evidence (they can’t) because their masters’ timetable demands that Assad be removed now – just as it did with Gaddafi in Libya. And the global corporate media is playing its usual part in repeating the lies as fact. By doing so the blood will be on their hands as well, just as it has always been throughout corporate media history. They are so stupid, so uninformed, so moronic, that they can’t see that they and their families are going to be subjected to the same Orwellian fascist society that they are providing the daily propaganda to justify”.These are powerful and instructive words from Icke. As Sir Winston Churchill once said ”the truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is”. May God bless and protect the good people Syria.Copyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2013/08/30/femi-fani-kayode-as-the-carnage-begins/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:40:22.403Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77db944719c866a1b70903"},"header":"Femi Fani-Kayode: The Trojan Horse and the Prince of Persia","time":"\nPublished\non September 23, 2015\n\n","content":"Home » Opinion » Femi Fani-Kayode: The Trojan Horse and the Prince of PersiaPublishedonBy”Israel will no longer exist in 25 years”- Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei , the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran.The Prince of Persia is a spirit being that the Holy Bible describes as a ”principality’’. He rules over the geographical space that was once known as Persia but that is now known as Iran.This is an entity that has the power to contend with even the most awesome of God’s angels. Judging from the words of Ayatollah Khamenei I have little doubt that he is firmly under the grip of this spirit being.When he speaks, it is not him that is speaking but rather it is the Prince of Persia that is speaking through him. This contribution is about the folly of trusting such a man and the manifest danger of entering into a nuclear arms deal with him.Permit me to begin with an aside. One of the consequences of the war in Syria and Iraq is the massive inflow of refugees from the Middle East into Europe. It is sad to see millions of people fleeing their homeland and walking half way across the world to escape the savagery of war.The question that arises is this: why have Saudi Arabia and the other Arab Gulf states refused to assist their Muslim and Arab brothers and take them in? Mr. Paul Joseph Watson raised some pertinent points in a contribution to Global Research. He wrote:‘’While European countries are being lectured about their failure to take in enough refugees, Saudi Arabia – which has taken in precisely zero migrants has 100,000 air conditioned tents that can house over 3 million people sitting empty. The sprawling network of high quality tents are located in the city of Mina, spreading across a 20 square km valley, and are only used for 5 days of the year by Hajj pilgrims. The tents could provide shelter for almost all of the 4 million Syrian refugees that have been displaced by the country’s civil war. While it refuses to take in any more refugees, Saudi Arabia has offered to build 200 mosques for the 500,000 migrants a year expected to pour into Germany. While Europe is being burdened by potentially millions of people who don’t share the same culture or religion as the host population, Gulf Arab states refuse to pull their weight, resolving only to throw money at the problem”.Mr. Watsons’ observations are legitimate.I support the assertion that the west should take in as many Arab refugees as possible on humanitarian grounds. However there must be a moment of pause whilst we consider the following questions.Is it possible that some of those that have fled to Europe are actually ISIS members who are using this opportunity to plant themselves in the very heart of western civilization where they can wreak havoc? Is there any truth in the Russian narrative that the massive exodus of Arab refugees into Europe today is nothing short of a “Trojan horse” invasion?Again is it conceivable that the refusal of the Saudis to receive any of the refugees is borne out of the fact that the quickest way to change the racial and religious identity of Europe and to bring greater Arab and Islamic influence to bear on western culture and civilization is the mass migration of millions of Muslim refugees into Europe?This suspicion is reinforced by the fact that instead of taking in the refugees the Saudi authorities have instead offered to build 200 mosques in Germany in order to cater for the migrants that seek refuge there.Do those voices in Europe that have called for caution in receiving the refugees have a point? That remains to be seen. This brings us to the very heart of this contribution and begs for an answer to the following question.If such an influx of refugees into Europe has been triggered off by what is essentially a Middle Eastern proxy war between the U.S.A and Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Russia and Iran on the other, can one possibly imagine the sheer carnage and massive influx that a war between Iran and Israel would cause?What is happening today would be child’s play when one considers that scenario. Yet those that support the Iran nuclear arms deal fail to appreciate the fact that strengthening Iran by lifting sanctions and putting hundreds of billions of dollars in the Iranian governments’ coffers takes us one step closer to such a conflict.Until Iran renounces its intention of spreading global jihad and until the clerics that rule that country stop their provocative rhetoric towards Israel there can never be peace.The only language that terror understands is an equal dose of terror. The policy of appeasement which the Iran nuclear deal represents is the worst thing that could have happened and those that have put it in place will have cause to deeply regret it.The greatest mistake that President Obama has made is to trust Iran. This is a country whose leaders have continuously referred to America as the ‘’great Satan’’ and Israel as the ‘’little Satan’’.This is a country whose Supreme Leader opens political rallies by chanting ‘’death to America’’. This is a country whose former President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that Israel would be ‘’wiped off the face of the earth’’.This is a country whose leaders believe in the coming of the great Muslim ”Mahdi”- the so-called “Guided One” whose coming, according to shia eschatology and prophecy, “will be heralded by the raising of a black flag in Kurasan”. This is a country whose leaders fully espouse the concept of global jihad and whose constitution specifically calls for the destruction of America and Israel.By this deal President Obama has given the Iranian government immense power and a new lease of life. This is a government that is perverse in all its ways and that presides over the affairs of a vicious and unrelenting theocratic state. This is a government that is led by a handful of misguided religious fanatics whose objective is to spread radical Islam throughout the world.This is a government that has taken away the basic freedoms of its’ own people and held them in bondage for the last 36 years. This is a government that exports blood, death and terror by funding terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Mehdi Army and many others throughout the world.Given all this can anyone legitimately dispute the words of the former Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr. Avigdor Lieberman, who described the nuclear deal as ”a surrender to terror”? On his part the Defence Minister of Israel, Mr. Moshe Yaalon, said it is a deal that was built on Iran’s ”lies and deceit”. He went further by describing the agreement as ”a tragedy for all who aspire for regional stability and who fear a nuclear Iran”.Most instructive of all was the contribution of Israel’s Education Minister, Mr. Naftali Bennet, who warned that: ”The history books have been re-written again today and this period will be deemed particularly grave and dangerous”. He said, ”western citizens who get up for another day at work or school are not aware of the fact that about half a trillion dollars has been transferred to the hands of a terrorist superpower, the most dangerous country in the world, who has promised the destruction of nations and peoples. Today it may be us, tomorrow it may reach every country in the form of suitcase bombs in London or New York. Israel has done everything possible to warn of danger and in the end it will follow its own interest and will do whatever it takes to defend itself” (See Peter Beaumonts’ article in the UK’s, Guardian Newspaper, 14th July 2015).These men have spoken nothing but the truth and the world would do well to listen. Sadly that does not appear to be happening because the American government has been sold a dummy and they have taken the full plunge. I have always viewed Obama’s policies in the Middle East and North Africa with suspicion.In my view he is the greatest friend that the radical jihadists have ever had in the White House and he has done more for their cause than any other American President. His support for the Iran nuclear deal confirms this.Permit me to conclude this contribution with a word to Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the man who said that Israel will ”no longer exist’’ in 25 years: hell will freeze over before Israel ever goes down.Mr. Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, responded to him in an equally eloquent manner by saying, “anyone who attacks Israel will pay with his life”.A word is enough for the wise. The day that Iran attacks Israel will be the day that Iran would have signed its own death warrant. They will be crushed beyond recognition and redemption.Femi Fani-Kayode: The coward called Godswill AkpabioFemi Fani-Kayode: A few good menFemi Fani-Kayode: Biafra, Buhari and his ‘soft’ Civil WarFemi Fani-Kayode: The sons of Satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 2]Femi Fani-Kayode: The sons of satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 1]Femi Fani-Kayode: When the bully met the headmaster at the White HouseCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2015/09/23/femi-fani-kayode-the-trojan-horse-and-the-prince-of-persia/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:40:50.946Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Today, I can hear the sound of the drums like I did then. The noise of the call to war. I was not too young in the late sixties to know about the civil war in my country. Of course, I vividly recall an enemy plane bombing Lagos during the war. I was out playing soccer with my friends when the bombs hit somewhere in the Yaba area of Lagos. I recall how we all scampered to our various homes. Though living in Lagos, far away we thought from the scene of war, the consequences of such situations were visible to us, kids, as we were, when refugees from the front lines, arrived the city in droves in different sad conditions with their tales of woes.For those who do not know or pretend not to know the effects of war, they need not go far to see today’s devastation of Northeastern Nigeria from the Boko Haram insurgency. If they are not satisfied, they can check footages of the wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Rwanda, Afghanistan and Syria on YouTube. The scenario is horrible. Life will become different as we know it. Humanity will become less than animals. We will descend to the abyss of hell without actually dying. People shall wish for death in the midst of death, and pain, blood, and grief shall be everyday companions of those in a land that once knew peace. Then the value of peace shall dawn on the actors, but it will be difficult to find.Let us note that all our friends and brothers in Nigeria who have nothing to do with this awful propaganda will be made to go Eastwards where they have no bearings or ties. Mind you, since the Southeast of Nigeria is landlocked those who seek the State of Biafra will continue to insist on including parts of the South-South of Nigeria, and of course we should expect disagreements. Conflicts and disagreements such as this are what starts wars. Those who will suffer most are children, women and old people. Of course, expect the maiming and killing of many youths in their prime as they will be the ones to do the battle. Do not forget the millions of people (mostly the young) who were killed by both sides during the Nigerian Civil war in the sixties.For all those who are keeping quiet now, know that you will not have the chance to speak as you would now once the war starts. We all have the opportunity to speak out for peace now. Now is the time to blow the ember of a peaceful coexistence and not war. Now is the time to form groups for peace. Now is the time to use your social media platforms to preach the gospel of peace to your followers. I am yet to see groups like Igboland Against War (IAW), Yorubas Against War (YAW), Hausa Against War (HAW), Igbos love Nigeria (ILN), Yorubas for an Equitable Nigeria (YEN), Hausas for One Nigeria (HON), dominate the social discussion.Let us avoid the carnage that may take the lives of millions of Nigeria, talk is cheaper than war, and it is the only option that will eventually settle our differences. In war, all sides will lose and eventually there will always be devastation, more hatred, unfulfilled dreams, suspicion, loss of lives and properties, economic and political collapse. Even the little we have now won’t be there, food will be scarce, families will be separated, our daughters will be forced by the war into prostitution, our children will be conscripted to fight a war they do not understand, death shall be our daily companion, and human life will become worthless.As for those who would have caused the carnage, the high and mighty, the wealthy political elite, they will run away abroad and leave the poor and middle class to bear the brunt. Countries will shut their borders, and many will be trapped in the hellhole that Nigeria will become.We can yet avoid this seemingly impending Hiroshima. Let the political elites from all the warring ethnic groups this time around, and sincerely too, sit down and work out the modalities for equity, justice, and peaceful coexistence, as we all stand to gain as a united Nigeria. Let all our brothers, sisters, wives and husbands stand up to speak for unity, peace, equity, and justice. There are more Igbo outside Igboland than inside. Yorubas, Hausas, Ibibios, Ogoris, Idomas and indeed all Nigerians stand to lose everything and gain nothing from this act that is playing out. Everyone will be affected by war, so, before it becomes irreversible let this death bearing vehicle stop and move no more.Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, an Economic Development Specialist and the Chairman of the Editorial Board of Sahel Standard writes from Abuja.2019: Why Saraki is the right presidential candidate for Nigeria – Baraje2019: What Chris Okotie said about defection by Nigerian politiciansUK ex-minister speaks on conflict in Nigeria’s governmentFIFA releases Nigeria’s latest ranking in world footballNorthern Nigeria most backward people in the world – Nuhu RibaduJonathan speaks on state of the nation, tells Nigerians what to doCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2017/06/12/adesoji-adesugba-nigeria-reasons-stop-drumbeats-war/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:41:05.669Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Given this sobering news it is a matter of tremendous relief and indeed joy that President Barack Obama has announced that it is the intention of the United States to ‘’degrade and destroy’’ ISIL by launching a series of deadly airstrikes and to play a more vigorous and active role in the fight against terror.Our very own President Goodluck Jonathan and the Nigerian Armed Forces have a lesson to learn from this new-found American initiative and resolve: it is time for us to take off the gloves and to despatch our own local equivalent of ISIS back to hell where they belong.It is time for us to recognize the fact that were are not just fighting against a group of barbaric, primitive and ignorant peasants, cave men and insurgents who lack compassion and human decency but rather that we are involved in a full scale civil war against a sophisticated, clever, determined, well-funded, well-motivated, well-armed and relentless enemy who have plenty of resources and local support from elements within the political class and who are hell-bent on killing our people, raping our women, abducting our children, dismembering our country and taking us back to the 6th century.Had it not been for the admirable efforts of Colonel Sambo Dasuki, who was appointed National Security Advisor after the demise of General Patrick Azazi a couple of years back, things would have been a lot worse and Abuja would have still been under siege today. Had it not been for the sheer dexterity and immense courage of our intelligence agencies and Armed Forces the towns of Bama, Konduga and a number of other communities in the north-east would still have been occupied by the Haramites today and Maiduguri itself, the capital of Borno State, may well have fallen by now.I have nothing but praise, gratitude and admiration for our uniformed men and women that are fighting at the warfront and I pray for them every day. Regardless of a few set backs here and there they really have done us proud. Yet things should never have got this bad in the first place and Boko Haram ought to never have been allowed to make the kind of inroads and impact that they have made in the last four years. Three years ago I warned about this threat and offered similar counsel in a series of essays about Boko Haram.I also criticised what I considered to be the Federal Government’s inadequate response to the challenge at the time. Sadly, rather than listen, the majority of Nigerian politicians, newspaper columnists, government officials and professional commentators, as usual, condemned me roundly, said that I was an alarmist and complained that I was being far too harsh on the enemy and far too extreme in my counsel.One particular individual even accused me of being a ‘’bloodthirsty and callous maniac who had no value for human life’’. Clearly they misunderstood what Boko Haram stood for and they had no understanding of the nature of the beast that they were dealing with.Today, almost 20,000 cold-blooded murders and hundreds of abductions and kidnappings later, the very same people that condemned me and ostracised me three years ago for advocating that the Jonathan administration ought to ”treat Boko Haram like a festering and putrid cancer”, ‘’kill all the Haramites and their secret friends, allies and sponsors” and that ”they should blow up the towns that were loyal to them or that harbored them’’ are now commending my foresight.They are also burying their heads in shame and hiding under their beds whenever they hear the words ‘’Boko Haram’’. Worse still those of them that are southerners are urging their fellow southerners that live in the north to leave the north as quickly as possible and move back to the south as a consequence of the scourge, as if that would not play right into the hands of the terrorists.The truth is that the majority of Nigerians are notoriously shortsighted people who are not only undiscerning but who also always choose to believe the best about the villains and the worst about the good guys. Sadly this has played right into the hands and the horrific narrative of the beasts and terrorists that seek to decimate us and consequently for the last three years they have had a field day.Yet, if it is any consolation, this has been so throughout the world and not just in Nigeria. The Jonathan administration were not the only ones that were slow in their initial response to the challenge presented by the islamists and they were not the only ones that failed to fully comprehend and appreciate the fact that the terrorists needed to be utterly crushed right from the outset.The Obama administration and indeed the rest of the civilised world made the same mistake when confronted with similar terrorist organisations in north Africa, the Middle East and east Africa in the last three years. The result of that lack of foresight is the fact that today ISIS, ISIL and the Islamic State have now become a threat to the entire free world.In Africa groups like Boko Haram and Al Shabab have drawn immense inspiration and courage from the successes of ISIL and ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ISIL is the greatest threat to world peace today and they have committed more horrors and indulged in more violence than any other islamist terrorist organisation that has ever existed.They are providing moral support for Al Qaeda in the north African Maghreb, Al Shabab in East Africa, Boko Haram in west Africa, Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Chechnyan separatists in Russia, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Islamic Jihad in Algeria, Daesh in Lebanon, the Al Nusra Front in Syria and all the other vermin that is crawling out from under the woodwork in the name of violent Jihad and in an attempt to create a new world Caliphate.Thousands of Christians, moderate Muslims and people of other faiths have been slaughtered in cold blood and abducted, raped and sold into slavery by the Boko Haramites and their allies and associates in northern Nigeria, the Cameroons and Mali in the last 4 years alone.This is a global war and we must ALL stand together to create more awareness and to fight it. I put much of the blame for the mess we are in on the doorstep of President Obama. He has been weak and naive on this matter right from the start.He refused to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation up until early this year even though by the end of last year they had butchered well over 15,000 Nigerians. This is inexplicable and it is indefensible.Even worse was his covert support for the rebels in Syria which included ISIS, Al Nusra and all the other islamist terrorists that were, and still are, fighting the government of President Bashar Al Assad. This policy was not only short-sighted and counterproductive but it was also nothing short of reprehensible.Ditto the support that some of America’s closest allies in the region including Saudi Arabia, Turkey and all the other countries in the Middle East that funded the so-called rebels that were fighting Al Assad. Thankfully those rebels have not succeeded up until today.If they had done so we would have had an ISIL/Al Nusra government in power in Damascus today and I cannot imagine what could possibly be worse than that for peace in the Middle East and for peace with Israel.On that score I say thank God for the Russians, Hezbollah (yes Hezbollah) and Iran who saw that the greater evil was ISIL and Al Nusra and who supported Al Assad and stood with him against them. America and her allies have to sit up, do some real soul-searching and endeavor to stop creating the unholy mess that the the rest of the world has to later assist in cleaning up.Let us face it, getting rid of men like Muammar Ghadaffi, Saddam Hussein and Hosni Mubarak was a big mistake. The Arab spring has turned into a never-ending and horrific nightmare and that nightmare appears to want to consume the entire world in fratricidal butchery and never-ending carnage.Yes those men were ruthless and brutal dictators but at least they were secularists who knew how to deal with islamist terror and Al Qaeda and at least they kept the peace in their respective countries and regions.No they were not democrats but neither are the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan or any other ally of America in the Middle East except for Israel.What is going on today in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Egypt today as a direct consequence of the choices that America made and the implementation of American foreign policy in those countries over the last ten to fifteen years is simply perverse and barbaric.It is a tragedy of monumental proportions and it really does have implications for the entire free world and particularly for the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Israel. One thing is clear: whether we like to admit it or not the violent terrorists with their barbaric vision of a new islamist world order are here to stay.We either do nothing, accept it and prepare for the worst or we fight it with all that we have got. I would prefer that we do the latter. Given the new-found resolve of the Americans in their struggle against ISIL and given the recent gains that the Nigerian Armed Forces have made in the war with Boko Haram it is clear that we are now moving in the right direction. May God deliver us and may He grant us the victory in this noble quest.Femi Fani-Kayode: The coward called Godswill AkpabioFemi Fani-Kayode: A few good menFemi Fani-Kayode: Biafra, Buhari and his ‘soft’ Civil WarFemi Fani-Kayode: The sons of Satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 2]Femi Fani-Kayode: The sons of satan and the seed of Beelzebub [Part 1]Femi Fani-Kayode: When the bully met the headmaster at the White HouseCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2014/09/14/femi-fani-kayode-quest-new-world-caliphate/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:41:19.375Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dbbe4719c866a1b70909"},"header":"Femi Fani-Kayode: Syria – Putin’s bombs and a call to arms","time":"\nPublished\non October 13, 2015\n\n","content":"Home » Opinion » Femi Fani-Kayode: Syria – Putin’s bombs and a call to armsPublishedonByThe sound and sight of Russian cruise missiles and smart bombs dropping on thousands of ISIL fighters in Syria is a thing of joy. It is like music to my ears. At last someone has cultivated the courage to stop the pampering and to desist from trying to rationalize the evil of ISIS and the forces of terror. I have no doubt that President Vladimir Putin is being used by God to deliver the world from the greatest evil that we have witnessed since Hitler’s fascism. The Russians are doing a great work in Syria.They confronted and crushed the evil of terrorism in Chechnya and now they are doing it in the Middle East. Mr. Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi and his ISIL fighters deserve no mercy. They deserve even worse than they are getting. We must encourage the Russians to keep the bombs flying and to send the demons to hell where they belong.This ought to be a lesson to the world and to President Obama. You don’t encourage and tolerate evil on the altar of political expediency and neither should you support or covertly fund terrorists. More importantly whether the west wishes to accept it or not there is a new kid on the block who refuses to take prisoners and who understands the importance of wiping out the dark forces and bringing in the light.Those that believe that terrorists should be treated lightly, should be granted amnesty, should be negotiated with or should be used for a greater purpose have failed to grasp the importance of the following counsel: when the rubbish begins to stink you must throw it out. When slaves begin to overestimate their own importance and relevance you must cut off their balls.When dogs seek to rule in the land of men you must shoot them in the head. When a chicken starts to believe that it is an eagle you must cut off its beak. When the witch begins to afflict humanity you must burn her at the stake. When demons begin to call themselves angels you must send them back to hell.When psychopaths and sociopaths rule the land you must kill them all and ensure that there is no trace of their existence. Clearly Putin has imbued this philosophy and this set of principles very well. And it serves our collective purpose. Four years ago I advocated the Putin approach to confronting Boko Haram in Nigeria. In a series of essays I argued that we must wipe them out and if necessary blow up the communities and towns that covertly give them support.I made the case that they were nothing but pure evil and that they represented something so reprehensible and beastly that it was far beyond the understanding or imagination of the average Nigerian. I told the Nigerian people that if it required the systematic slaughter of entire populations to remove the cancer of jihadist terror then we must cultivate the courage to get on with the job and do it.I argued that President Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern-day Turkey, killed over one million fundamentalists and terrorists in his quest to establish a modern-day Muslim secular state and that it worked. I told the world that as long as Saudi Arabia continued to propagate and covertly fund the Wahhabi philosophy and the Salifist movement that the world would not know peace and that neither would we be free of terror.More importantly I warned the world about the danger of trusting President Barack Obama and how his covert policy of supporting terror groups like the Al Nusra Front in Syria against a secularist Syrian government would lead to disaster. As usual all my counsel fell on deaf ears and I received nothing but insults from the majority of our people who labeled me as hater of Muslims and who couldn’t see beyond their noses.They were unable to make a distinction between a true Muslim and a radical jihadist who believes in the use of terror and violence. The result of their lack of understanding and foresight is what we have today both in Syria and Nigeria. Abuja is being bombed again and once again our soldiers are being slaughtered on the war front. Ever since the present administration has come to power the gains that were made by the previous administration against Boko Haram have been lost.Worst still the terrorist group have managed to mount a major counter-offensive against our cities in the north-east and to slaughter thousands in our civilian population. Just a few days ago no less than five bombs went off in one day. There is no doubt in my mind that now more than ever we need to retrace our steps and look to Putin’s Russia as our natural ally in our fight against terror. If we want to stamp out Boko Haram we must look to the Russian Federation.If we refuse to eat humble pie and get the help that we need then we must prepare for greater casualties and more losses in our fight against terror. This is all the more so given the fact that Boko Haram has now joined ranks with ISIS.Permit me to end this contribution with a few words about the nature of the jihadists. They have an insatiable appetite for sadism and cruelty. They do not have the milk of human kindness in them and neither do such creatures react to gentle appeals. I say this because they are fundamentalists and zealots that are totally committed to destroying everything that we hold dear. Simply put they have gone beyond the realms of reason and rationality. If anyone doubts this they should find out about the horrific plight of the Yazidis’ in Iraq and Syria whose women are treated as nothing but spoils of war by the ISIL fighters.These are ruthless and bloodthirsty men and they are committed to the destruction of the secular state, to the abrogation of our most basic civil liberties and human rights, to the waging of a global jihad and to the creation of a new Islamic caliphate where full sharia law is practiced and where Christianity and all other forms of religion, except for their own perverse understanding and interpretation of Islam, are banned. They also wish to change our way of life and impose their will on us through violent and barbaric means.People that are so debased and that have such little regard for human life and values are hardly likely to listen to appeals from anyone. You do not offer carrots to beasts. The only things they understand are bombs and the only language they appreciate is violence.A leading Pakistani politician made an interesting and relevant contribution on CNN last year when he spoke about the horrific stoning to death of a young lady outside the High Court in Islamabad simply because she married the man of her choice. He said, ’’Pakistan is a country in which some people are fighting to keep us in the 21st century whilst others are fighting to take us back into the 8th century”. This is the bitter truth and the same conflict is playing out in parts of the Middle East, north Africa, east Africa and Nigeria.It is time for us to come together and cleanse our land of these godless creatures. They should be cleansed from the land and eliminated in the same way that cockroaches and rats are cleansed and eliminated from a filthy house. This is because they are nothing but vermin and vampires from hell sent to our nation by Satan to torment and destroy us.They have slaughtered and raped our women and children, they have butchered and crucified our men, they have burnt our homes and bombed and desecrated our places of worship, they have slaughtered our religious leaders, they have taken over our communities and they have flown their evil black flag in parts of our nation.What more do they have to do to us before we cultivate the courage and the firm resolve to rise up and resist them? This is a call to arms. I call on every Nigerian to rise up, to fight the evil and to protect the integrity of our land and our people.I call on the military to be professional, thorough, brutal and ruthless, to show no mercy and to hold no quarter. I call on our people to have no dealings or interaction with ANYONE or any group of people that suggest that we should have dialogue with or that we should grant amnesty to Boko Haram.I call on them to view such people with the utmost suspicion. I say this because you do not reward mass murderers, sociopaths, psychopaths, homicidal maniacs, child abductors, king-slayers, child rapists and criminally insane terrorists with amnesty or dialogue. Instead you dispatch them to hell where they belong. It is the same for Boko Haram and all those that secretly collaborate with them.We must not view them as human beings but as savage beasts and demons that eat human flesh and drink human blood. That is what they are: the spoilers and abductors of little girls. They are not worthy of life. They are not worthy of God’s mercy.They are not worthy of our people or of our nation. To destroy them is our holy duty before the Living God: it is God’s will that they should be wiped off the face of the earth and that the Nigerian people should be rid of them forever.Copyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","url":"http://dailypost.ng/2015/10/13/femi-fani-kayode-syria-putins-bombs-and-a-call-to-arms/","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:41:32.754Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dbd24719c866a1b7090b"},"header":"Femi Fani-Kayode: The shame of a nation","time":"\nPublished\non December 24, 2016\n\n","content":"Home » Opinion » Femi Fani-Kayode: The shame of a nationPublishedonByI just watched a very sad and disturbing video of our soldiers on the war front begging their President and Commander in Chief to provide them with food and water. They did this through footage which was shot on their cell phone cameras and released as a short video on social media.They were desperate, angry and very loud and some of them were shedding tears about their deep frustration and sorry plight.We saw the lifeless bodies of at least two of them who had apparantly died, not of bullet wounds, but of exhaustion, starvation and lack of water.We saw and heard others as they were slowly dying and we heard their heavy panting and deep groans. We also heard and saw the anger, aggression, loud lamentations and startling complaints from the troops, one of whom had the courage to film the whole thing.He and at least three of his colleagues appealed to those of us that were watching the video on social media to let the President know what they are going through. It was very moving and even the most hardened heart would have melted whilst watching that video.This was a heart-breaking and pathetic scene. These young soldiers had just won a major battle on the war front and they had just recovered numerous towns and villages from Boko Haram yet they were not even given water to quench their thirst or food to fill their stomachs after what was obviously a hard fight. How could things have got so bad?This is the sort of thing that leads to mutiny and rebellion in the military and once that starts no-one is safe and no-one can stop it.I urge the Chief of Army Staff and indeed our President to do something about this problem quickly and ease the suffering and pain of our servicemen and women at the warfront and indeed when they come home.In a country with a civilised government members of the Armed Forces that are prepared to sacrifice their lives just to keep our borders secure and the rest of us safe are cherished and honored. Their salaries are paid promptly and regularly and they are not starved of water and food whilst on the warfront and whilst fighting a battle. The sorry plight of our gallant warriors in todays Nigeria is indeed the shame of the nation.Instead of meeting the needs of our soldiers we are told that the military authorities are sending them to Argentina to learn about cattle-rearing and that they are preparing to set up cattle ranches in every state of the Federation.One wonders why? What purpose does this serve? Is there a hidden agenda? Is it an attempt to smuggle in the rejected Grazing Reserve Bill through the back door? What on earth has cattle-rearing and setting up cattle ranches for itinerant and vagrant herdsmen got to do with soldiering? I guess one does not have to dig too deep to find the answers.These are indeed interesting times and those that seek to utterly demoralise, destroy, demystify and demean the essence, ethos, confidence and very fabric of our Armed Forces and our military men have gone far.Instead of equipping them to fight on the war front and providing them with the necessary provisions on the battle field they are turning them into cattle-rearers, herdsmen and farmers.\nWhat a tragedy!Yet for our country the picture is even more bleak than that. It is not just the military that are going through hell but the people, both high and low, as well.That is what drove Mr. Edwin Dico Okugbo to write the following words out of what can only be described as frustration and anger. He wrote,“Buhari is not fighting against corruption. He is stealing the nation blind. 2015 and 2016 budgets have already been embezzled and they are already moving to 2017. Everyone around him has been exposed already as crooks. Which corruption is he fighting? He is only fighting his enemies to consoldate political power. He is the worst thing that has ever happened to Nigeria. A big scam!”Harsh words indeed yet there can be little doubt that Mr. Okugbo reflects the thinking of many.The bitter truth is that there is unprecedented hardship and suffering in the land. There is also injustice, wickedness, persecution, abuse of power, mass murder, corruption, impunity, religious and ethnic marginalisation, sectarian butchery and conflict, state-sponsored genocide, extra-judicial killings and massive and debilitating poverty. Few are feeling the joy and love of Christmas this season. Yet sadly this is precisely what the Nigerian people wanted.At the risk of our liberty, lives and reputation some of us warned them about the dangers of voting for the great evil of Buhari and his APC.There is nothing that is happening today that I did not accurately predict would happen if Buhari was given power.People laughed me to scorn, insulted me, threatened me, made mockery of me and said that I was wrong but I have been proved right.You see the problem is that most Nigerians do not know the history of their nation and neither can they possibly comprehend the obsessive, narcissistic and sociopathic nature and disposition of most of their leaders.Most of our people are incapable of any form of logical reasoning or analytical deduction that is truly detached from or devoid of emotion and irrational thinking.Worse of all they do not understand the prophetic or what is known as “revelation knowledge”.Knowledge means nothing to them and, simply put, they worship and rever money and power and nothing else.Most Nigerians will do anything, including selling their own heritage, glory and divinely ordained destiny, to have or achieve that money and power or to appease those that possess and wield it.Consequently if a rich man, a powerful politician or a key government official defecates in his pants at a party or a public function the average Nigerian will continue to celebrate him there and then and tell him and the entire world that he smells like roses or like the finest and most expensive perfume in the world. That is how depraved some of us are.\n.We have a terrible aversion to truth and we are very comfortable with living with suffering, wickedness and injustice.In fact the greater the injustice, violence, persecution and wickedness that the state metes out to others the more comfortable and the happier we are.We actually enjoy it and secretly rejoice when those around us and our compatriots suffer pain, death, humiliation, shame, hardship, destruction, injustice and persecution. It is a strange and self-destructive disposition and a devious form of sado-masochism.For example just to spite President Goodluck Jonathan and his Niger Delta people and get him out of power the Nigerian people brought Buhari upon themselves. Can there be a greater example of an entire people cutting their nose to spite their face?This was made all the worse by the fact that Jonathan enjoyed massive support in the south east which has come to be the whipping boy of the Nigerian state. The thinking was that if the Igbo wanted Jonathan then he had to be stopped at all costs.Consequently a radical, angry, vengeful, bitter and divisive Buhari who was viewed and often described by his supporters as the nations “mahdi” and “messiah” became their choice.They chose him over the gentle, soft-spoken, forgiving, accomodating and humble Jonathan who was maliciously depicted as a clueless, corrupt and incompetent villain.This was a grave error. I say that because the former was malignant and the latter was benign. The former was malevolent and the latter was benevolent.It was rather like the time that the Jews chose our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ over the armed robber and murderer Barabas for crucifixion.It was like choosing night over day. It was like choosing s demon over an angel. It was like choosing evil over good.For the mess we are in today and the disaster and impending doom that our nation is facing I blame those in the core north who introduced religion into our politics and who wanted power back at all costs, those in the Middle Belt who supported them in that quest for reasons best known to themselves and those in the south west that have come to be known as the “Jagaban Yorubas” that supported the diabolical and occultic concept of “chanji”.I also blame a small but notable and identifiable section of the media who sold their heritage for a mess of pottage and who have opted to remain silent and, in some cases even openly encourage and support, the evil that has been visited upon us as our nation goes to the dogs.All these groups and individuals have betrayed the Nigerian people. They have destroyed their destinies, enslaved their children, impoverished their lives, shamed their loved ones, dishonored their forefathers, divided their nation, shattered their dreams and set our country back by at least 50 years.The truth is that by the time this is all over we may not even have a country left.Those that voted for this mess and put us in it should enjoy their “change” and live with the consequences of their stupid choice.Do you know the number of families that cannot even afford to buy turkeys this Christmas? Do you know the number of people that will not get presents or be given Christmas gifts by their parents, siblings, spouses and loved ones this season?Do you know the number of children that will silently shed tears this Christmas and that will secretly wish that they had never been born Nigerians? It has never been this bad in our entire history and it really is so sad.Those that put us in this terrible mess deserve no mercy and no pity. They certainly do not deserve a second mandate in 2019. As for the Nigerian people they have finally got the leadership that they deserve.Our nation needs repentance and prayer. May God forgive and deliver us from His tool of judgement.Permit me to conclude this contribution with the following observations.I was right when I wrote both in 2008 and 2012 that Barack Obama would divide America and the entire world and that by the time he finished his tenure the American people would reject his legacy.I was right when I wrote about what the outcome of the war in Syria would be and how the Americans were making a big mistake by supporting the terrorists, jihadists and islamic fundamentalists and trying to remove Bashar Al Assad.I was right when I wrote that the Americans and the Europeans were making a huge mistake by removing and killing Muammar Ghadaffi of Libya.I was right when I wrote that Europe was making a mistake by allowing in the Syrian refugees who I described at the time as a Trojan horse.I was right when I wrote about the damage that Buhari would do to our land if he was given a mandate to lead the Nigerian people.I was right when I wrote about the damage that Ali Modu Sheriff would do the opposition Peoples Democratic Party if he was given the position of National Chairman.I was right when I wrote that Donald J. Trump would win the presidential primaries of the American Republican Party to become their presidential candidate and when I wrote that he would go on to win the presidential election against Hilary Clinton.I was also right when I wrote that Nana Akufo-Addo would win the presidential election in Ghana.All these things came to me by revelation knowledge and by the power of the Holy Spirit and not by logical deduction or any power of my own.Now let me share another prophetic word with you today by saying the following. For President Muhmmadu Buhari, like the biblical King Belshassar of Babylon, the writing is on the wall. And Like Belshassar he has been weighed and found wanting.Soon he will be gone and the Lord will raise a new leader: a biblical Cyrus with the heart of David, who will heal, unite and prosper our land.This new leader will be a blessing to our people. He will remove our shame, restore our peace, return our joy, rebuild our walls, encourage and strengthen our Church and men and women of God, re-establish our sacred alters, resurrect and re-invoke our covenant with the Living God, defend our borders, jealously guard our people and bring glory and honor to our nation.Thus sayest the Lord and so it shall be. The vision is for an appointed time. Though it tarry, it shall not prove false.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dbe44719c866a1b7090d"},"header":"Million wounded in Syrian civil war","time":"Sat 18 Aug","content":"Beirut - One million people have been wounded during Syria's civil war and diseases are spreading as regular supplies of medicine fail to reach patients, the World Health Organisation's Syria representative said. A plunge in vaccination rates from 90 percent before the war to 52 percent this year and contaminated water have added to the woes, allowing typhoid and hepatitis to advance, Elizabeth Hoff said in an interview late on Thursday. More than 200,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, which began in March 2011 with popular protests against President Bashar al-Assad and spiralled into civil war after a crackdown by his security forces. “In Syria, they have a million people injured as a direct result of the war. You can see it in the country when you travel around. You see a lot of amputees,” said Hoff. “This is the biggest problem.” She said a collapsed health system, where over half of public hospitals are out of service, has meant that treatments for diseases and injuries are irregular. Hoff said that Assad's government - which demands to sign off on aid convoys - is still blocking surgical supplies, such as bandages and syringes, from entering rebel-held areas. Aid workers say Damascus argues that the equipment would be used to help insurgents. “What has been a problem is the regularity of supply,” she said. “The (government) approvals are sporadic.” Syrian officials could not be reached for comment on Thursday or Friday. More than 6,500 cases of typhoid were reported this year across Syria and 4,200 cases of measles, the deadliest disease for Syrian children, Hoff said. There was just one reported case of polio, which can paralyse children within hours, in 2014 following a vaccination drive, but other new diseases appeared, including myiasis, a tropical disease spread by flies which is also known as screw-worm, with 10 cases seen in the outskirts of Damascus. Syrian activists in the Eastern Ghouta district of Damascus said that tuberculosis was also spreading due to poor sanitary conditions and a government siege on the area, blocking aid. The United Nations called on Thursday for more than $8.4 billion to help nearly 18 million people in need in Syria and across the region in 2015. Hoff said that the WHO delivered more than 13.5 million treatments of life saving medicines and medical supplies in 2014, up nearly threefold from the year before. But the problems were growing at an even faster pace, Hoff said, with poor water access and deepening poverty worsening the health crisis: “The needs are not possible to believe.”Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","url":"https://www.iol.co.za/news/world/million-wounded-in-syrian-civil-war-1797571","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:42:10.305Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dbf74719c866a1b7090f"},"header":"‘Syria is in civil war’","time":"Sat 18 Aug","content":"Syria is heading for collapse and will become a “warehouse of weapons” for Islamist militants as it descends into chaos, a senior Israeli army commander said. “Syria is in civil war, which will lead to a failed state, and terrorism will blossom in it,” said Major-General Yair Golan, making a rare public appearance at a conference at Bar Ilan University on Wednesday. “Syria has a big arsenal.” The Arab republic's stock of mainly Russian-made weapons includes surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles and marine missiles. It also possesses chemical weapons which Syria never used in its wars against Israel but which could be attractive weapons for militants, the general said. “The risk to Israel is taking shape,” said Golan, who is commander of Israeli forces on the border with Lebanon and the disengagement line with Syria in the Golan Heights. “The challenge we are facing is a huge one,” he added, according to a translation. The Israel Defence Forces were “deeply engaged in getting ready, with plans and physical means” along the borders, the Northern Command chief said, without offering specific details. It was very difficult to forecast how Syria would break up, Golan said. It could be effectively “cantonised” by the conflict that has raged for 14 months since President Bashar al-Assad turned his army on protesters and a rebel force fought back. Golan said Assad's ally Iran was trying hard to help the president stay in power, and Iran's Lebanese ally Hezbollah was in turn a very determined enemy of Israel which has “no intention of letting us off easily”. Hezbollah “feel obligated to their guardian (Iran) and when needed they are going to do what Iran is interested in”, he told an academic audience at the Begin-Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies. Hezbollah is the most potent hostile military force directly on one of Israel's borders, but it has done nothing evident in the past 14 months to exploit the Syrian crisis or start trouble with Israel to divert attention from Assad's bloody crackdown. The Shi'a movement was focused on creating a “comprehensive ballistic array”, Golan said. At the moment, most of the estimated 60 000 rockets and missiles Hezbollah has in place are short-range, low-payload rockets. “It's not nice to live under this threat in northern Israel, but this type of threat is not a decisive factor against Israel,” he said. “Let's not exaggerate when we talk about it.” Hezbollah also has longer-range and more accurate missiles and hopes to obtain more to threaten all of Israel, he said. If Hezbollah were to attack, however, it could expect massive retaliation which would not be limited to Israeli air power, Golan said. Reliance on air power alone was “an hallucination”. There would also be a war of “manoeuvre”, he said, signifying a land offensive. “We need a combined effort,” Golan told the conference. In the event of a third Lebanon war, he said, the IDF would aim to “set back the next threat for a long time by hitting them (Hezbollah) very hard so they won't feel like engaging us again for many, many years”. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to dislodge Palestinian militants operating in the country. It finally withdrew its forces in 2000, but went back to war in 2006, clashing with Hezbollah guerrillas. About 1 200 people, mainly civilians, died in Lebanon in the subsequent fighting, along with 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers. - ReutersTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","url":"https://www.iol.co.za/news/world/syria-is-in-civil-war-1309022","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:42:29.134Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dc094719c866a1b70911"},"header":"Syria’s civil war eclipsed by IS terror","time":"Sat 18 Aug","content":"Damascus - As Syria's civil war rages into a fifth year, the daily suffering of its people has been overshadowed by atrocities committed by the Islamic State group that have sparked international horror.Four years after anti-regime protests broke out on March 15, 2011, jihadists control large tracts of territory, a defiant President Bashar al-Assad is clinging to power and revolutionary dreams have faded.The sickening tactics of IS have captured the world's attention in a conflict that has killed more than 210 000 people.With a brutality shown to the world in their own slick film productions, the jihadists have beheaded hostages, hung the bodies of “infidels” and “spies” from crosses, and thrown homosexuals from rooftops.They have paraded caged prisoners and enslaved women through the streets, released gruesome videos of the murder of Western hostages and burned alive a Jordanian fighter pilot.They have attacked minority communities and destroyed ancient artefacts.“IS has gone so far in its horror that it has succeeded in persuading the West that it represents the ultimate enemy, and that everyone else is a lesser evil,” said Karim Bitar, researcher at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Relations.“We have therefore returned to the state of mind that looks at everything through the prism of the war against terrorism,” he told AFP.IS began gaining prominence in 2013 as an al-Qaeda affiliate before essentially being disowned by the global extremist network.After initially avoiding confrontation with the Syrian army, it began openly fighting the regime the next year.By then, IS had captured territory in Syria's north and east from anti-regime rebels and al-Qaeda's official Syrian branch Al-Nusra Front.Last June IS declared an Islamic “caliphate” spanning swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq.Foreign fighters have streamed into Syria to join the jihadist ranks, causing alarm overseas about the prospect of battle-hardened militants coming home. By agreeing in 2013 to hand over its chemical weapons to a global watchdog, Syria ensured that the West would not intervene militarily against Assad, even after a deadly chemical attack that killed hundreds outside Damascus.With a US-led coalition now waging daily air strikes against the jihadists, the West increasingly sees Assad as a potential partner in the war against IS.Calls for his departure have fallen by the wayside. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura recently described Assad as “part of the solution”.“We have begun to think once again, like we did before the Arab revolutions, that authoritarianism is a lesser evil and that we should engage authoritarian regimes,” Bitar said.In a recent interview with Portuguese television, a confident Assad brushed off Syria's uprising as a Western conspiracy, much like he did in the very first stages of the revolt.“How could a revolution collapse or fail if you have the support of the West, the support of regional countries, all this money and armaments and so on?” he said.“You supposed that he's a dictator who is killing his good people, so the people are against him, regional countries are against him, and the West is against him - and he succeeded,” Assad said, referring to himself. The revolution has evolved into a complex conflict with many sides - from regime forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah Shi'a militants and Iranian military officers to opposition rebels, jihadist rivals and Kurdish militia.“In the first few years of the Syrian revolution, there were two clearly identified sides to the conflict. Today, it's a war of everyone against everyone,” said Bitar.The past year saw a dramatic decline of the Western-backed rebel Free Syrian Army, which after some initial military gains against Assad's forces has since been reduced to a sprinkling of weak and underfunded groups.Syria's economy and infrastructure have been destroyed. Hunger and cold knock on every door.More than 12 million people are in need of humanitarian aid and over 11 million have fled their homes.Emile Hokayem, senior fellow at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, does not expect a political solution in the foreseeable future.“The levels of violence may drop because a lot of people have already been killed and there will be a transfer of population,” he said.“But it's very difficult to see Syria being put together any time soon.”Pro-democracy activists have lost hope.“What revolution are we talking about now? I am totally convinced the international community has no conscience,” said Yazan Homsy, who endured a nearly two-year regime siege of his home city Homs.Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","url":"http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/syria-s-civil-war-eclipsed-by-is-terror-1.1830286","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:42:47.620Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Can it be done or not? On the whole, I believe it is possible,” he said.“It requires certain professionalism and patience. You cannot do anything by force and expect an immediate effect. A lot of people are involved in the conflict with various interests.“There is a need to find a convergence of these interests and have them sit down at a negotiating table. That's the direction we are going to work in.”He said that Moscow was interested in keeping the lines of communication to Damascus open.“It goes without saying that we will be in touch with President Assad and the Syrian leadership.”The meeting came amid mounting pressure for Moscow to drop its resistance to tougher UN action on Syria. Putin was to meet new French President Francois Hollande in Paris later Friday. - Sapa-AFPTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","url":"https://www.iol.co.za/news/world/putin-warns-of-syria-civil-war-wont-intervene-1.1310186","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:43:24.538Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

Air strikes killed dozens of people in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor said, and weary residents continued to stream out on foot as Russian-backed government forces pressed their campaign to capture the last big rebel bastion near Damascus.On another front, Turkish and allied Syrian rebel forces shelled the northern Kurdish-held town of Afrin, killing at least 18 people and forcing 2 500 people to flee, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported.The Kurdish YPG militia, defending Afrin, said it was fighting the Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies who tried to storm the town from the north.The two offensives, one backed by Russia and the other led by Turkey, have shown how Syrian factions and their foreign allies are aggressively reshaping the map of control after the defeat of Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate last year.The Syrian war entered its eighth year this week having killed half a million people and driven more than 11 million from their homes, including nearly 6 million who have fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times.The government launched its assault on eastern Ghouta a month ago and Turkey began its cross-border campaign in Afrin in January. In both cases, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped inside areas on the battlefield.Backed by Russia and Iran, government forces have thrust deep into eastern Ghouta, splintering the area into three separate enclaves. The UN believes up to 400 000 people have been trapped inside the rebel-held area of densely populated farms and satellite towns on the outskirts of the capital, with virtually no access to food or medicine.For the first time since the government unleashed the Ghouta offensive, one of the deadliest of the war, residents are fleeing in their thousands, carrying children and belongings on foot from rebel-held territory to reach government positions.Moscow and Damascus accuse the rebels of having forced people to stay in harm’s way to use them as human shields. The rebels deny this and say the aim of the government assault is to depopulate opposition areas.Syrian State TV broadcast footage of men, women and children walking along a dirt road near the town of Hammouriyeh, many of them carrying bags, to escape rebel-held areas. Some waved to the camera and said the rebels had stopped them from leaving.Around 5 000 people were sheltering at the nearby town of Adra and many more were expected to arrive this weekend, the Adra mayor said.The exodus began on Thursday with thousands fleeing the southernmost of the three Ghouta pockets. Russia said more than 12,000 people left on Thursday.The eastern Ghouta town of Douma, where many people are sheltering, has been spared the worst of the shelling in recent days, a resident said. - Reuters/African News Agency (ANA)Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

Hundreds are believed to have been killed since last Saturday, and the humanitarian conditions in the city have been worsening.Homs was under “brutal shelling” on Tuesday, the Local Coordination Committees activist group said, citing its network of witnesses on the ground.Another activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said it was the heaviest shelling in days.With diplomatic efforts bogged down, the conflict in Syria is taking on the dimensions of a civil war, with army defectors clashing almost daily with soldiers.UN human rights chief Navi Pillay warned on Monday that the Security Council's failure to take action has emboldened the Syrian government to launch an all-out assault.The uprising began last March as mostly peaceful protests against Assad's authoritarian rule, but has become more militarised in the face of the brutal military crackdown.Pillay told the General Assembly that more than 5 400 people were killed last year alone, and the number of dead and injured continues to rise daily.She said tens of thousands of people, including children, have been arrested, more than 18 000 reportedly are still arbitrarily detained and thousands more are reported missing. In addition, 25 000 people are estimated to have sought refuge in neighbouring countries and more than 70 000 are internally displaced.“The breadth and patterns of attacks by military and security forces on civilians, and the widespread destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure indicate approval or complicity by authorities at the highest level,” Pillay said.Also Monday, the Obama administration said it backs Arab League plans to end continuing violence in Syria but noted several obstacles to deploying a proposed international peacekeeping force to the country and withheld full endorsement of the idea.The administration has said repeatedly it does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, yet US officials indicated they would consider the Arab League call for peacekeepers and discuss it with various countries to see whether such an idea is feasible. However, they stressed there would be difficulties in getting required UN Security Council authorisation for a force.Chief among the hurdles is opposition by Russia and China, which vetoed a far less ambitious Security Council action already this month. Russia has said peacekeepers could not be sent without Syrian government approval; officials in Damascus already have rejected the proposal, calling it unjustified interference in internal affairs. - Sapa-APTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","url":"https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/un-warns-of-civil-war-in-syria-1.1234390","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:44:00.342Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dc624719c866a1b7091b"},"header":"Syria faces catastrophic civil war: Ban","time":"Sat 18 Aug","content":"Damascus -UN chief Ban Ki-moon warned on Thursday that Syria risks a “catastrophic civil war” following a massacre that sparked global outrage, as the United States criticised Russia for resisting tougher UN action.Syrian rebels threatened to escalate their operations unless the government of President Bashar al-Assad falls in line by midday (0900 GMT) on Friday with a six-point peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan.Ban, addressing a forum in Istanbul, made it clear he too expected Damascus to implement Annan's blueprint, which includes a ceasefire that should have taken effect on April 12 but has been violated daily ever since.“I demand that the government of Syria act on its commitment to the Annan peace plan,” the UN chief said.“The massacres of the sort seen last weekend could plunge Syria into a catastrophic civil war, a civil war from which the country would never recover.”He was referring to a slaughter near the central town of Houla on Friday and Saturday of 108 people, including 49 children and 34women.The assault prompted Western governments, including the United States, Britain, France and Australia, to expel the senior Syrian diplomats in their countries.In Denmark, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Russia's policy of resisting UN Security Council action against Damascus could contribute to a civil war.The Russians “are telling me they don't want to see a civil war. I have been telling them their policy is going help to contribute to a civil war,” she told a mainly student audience in Copenhagen.Clinton warned that unless checked, the deadly violence in Syria could even develop into a proxy war because of Iran's support for the Assad's regime.A team led by Annan visited Syria earlier this week and called for “concrete gestures” from Assad on halting the violence.But with Annan receiving no firm commitments from the Syrian leader, the rebel Free Syrian Army's command inside the country gave the president an ultimatum on Thursday.A statement said that if the regime “does not meet the deadline by Friday midday, the command ... will no longer be tied by any commitment to the Annan plan ... and our duty will be ... to defend civilians.”Speaking in reaction to the “barbarous” massacre, the FSA said “there is no more justification for us to unilaterally respect the truce because (Assad) has buried Annan's plan.”It said it would announce in the coming days “a series of decisive and courageous decisions for the next phase” of its struggle.Indicating serious divisions within the ranks, Turkey-based FSA chief Colonel Riyadh al-Asaad prompted a sharp retort from the leadership inside Syria after he denied there had been an ultimatum.Colonel Kassem Saadeddine, speaking to AFP from Syria, said:“From now on, all decisions will be taken from inside Syria. Anyone who wants to speak in the name of the FSA should do it from the battlefield, not through media.”The United States, France, Britain and Germany all emerged from a Security Council meeting on Wednesday urging stronger measures by the body.US ambassador Susan Rice said if Damascus did not adhere to the Annan plan, then the council had to “assume its responsibilities” and step up pressure.In the absence of either scenario, and if the violence continued to worsen, “then members of this council and members of the international community are left with the option only of having to consider whether they're prepared to take actions outside of the Annan plan and the authority of this council.”Her remarks appeared to signal that Washington and its allies would consider acting alone if Russia and China continued to block tough action.But the US envoy to NATO said on Thursday military action was not under consideration.“The issue of military intervention, which is also always complex, is not right now on the table when it comes to Syria,” he said.Russia and China, which have both blocked previous attempts at the Security Council to condemn Assad, joined other council members on Sunday in approving a statement condemning the Houla massacre.But Russia insists that that rebuke went far enough and that further action would be counter-productive.President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said that stance would not change under pressure.“Russia's position is well-known. It is balanced and consistent,” Interfax quoted spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying on Thursday. “So it is hardly appropriate to talk about this position changing under someone's pressure.”On the ground, Syrian forces resumed shelling in Houla, which had begun on Wednesday, with a young boy killed by a sniper, the Observatory said.And battles raged as troops and rebels clashed across the country, with the Observatory saying at least 13 other people were killed. - Sapa-AFPTrevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","url":"https://www.iol.co.za/news/world/syria-faces-catastrophic-civil-war-ban-1309231","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-18T16:44:16.565Z"},"parent_keyword":"syria civil war"}

The Syrian crisis is high on the agenda during talks between President Vladimir Putin with German and French leaders in Berlin and Paris on Friday.Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Francois Hollande will try to get Putin to drop his opposition to a tough-worded UN Security Council resolution on Syria.It is going to get harder for Russia to continue its military and diplomatic backing of al-Assad as the violence turns more brutal.“We consider that recent tragic events constitute an additional reason for the Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court,” UN rapporteur on arbitrary executions Christof Heyns said.An EU official on Friday the bloc will push Russia to assume its “responsibilities” in helping to stem the violence in Syria when the two sides meet for a summit in Saint Petersburg at the weekend.“This is not about pressuring Russia, this is about realising that we have responsibilities to stop the suffering of the Syrian people and find a political way out,” the official said in Brussels, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “We have all seen how much influence and potential leverage Russia has in Syria.”Rights group Amnesty International urged Putin to halt Russian arms sales to Syria immediately.British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that “all options” must be considered over the escalating conflict in Syria, though the military option is not on the cards yet.The Foreign Office in London confirmed that Hague would hold talks with Syrian opposition groups on the sidelines of a peace conference on Somalia in Istanbul.Meanwhile, at least 15 factory workers were “tortured and then executed” by pro-government forces in the central province of Homs, Syrian activists said.They added the killings occurred in the village of al-Bueidha where the workers were stopped at an army roadblock and taken to a nearby military post.Clashes were in the southern province of Daraa, where rebels attacked a military checkpoint, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. – Sapa-dpa Trevor Noah slammed for Imran Khan and Catholic Church commentsMnangagwa answers burning questions on Mugabe, spy allegations and electionsMuslim couple denied Swiss citizenship over handshake refusalControversy after Trump claims Aretha Franklin 'worked' for himWATCH: Husband 'confessed' to killing pregnant wife and two daughtersSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

Syria’s White Helmets, who act as first responders in rebel-held areas of Syria, said the attack took place late on Saturday using “poisonous chlorine gas”. “More than 500 cases - the majority of whom are women and children - were brought to local medical centres with symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent,” according to a joint statement issued by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) and the White Helmets. Patients showed signs of “respiratory distress, central cyanosis, excessive oral foaming, corneal burns, and the emission of chlorine-like odour”, it said. Medics had “observed bradycardia, wheezing and coarse bronchial sounds”. The statement said civil defence volunteers had found 42 casualties dead in their homes “with similar clinical symptoms of excessive oral foaming, cyanosis, and corneal burns”. Six others had died while receiving treatment. Footage posted online by the White Helmets, which was not possible to verify, showed victims with yellowed skin crumpled on the ground and foaming at the mouth. Douma is the last remaining opposition-held town in Eastern Ghouta, once the rebels’ main bastion outside Damascus but now ravaged by a seven-week regime assault. Since February 18, Syrian and Russian forces have waged a fierce military onslaught. While no one has yet provided evidence of its involvement, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country’s seven-year civil war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, said the regime carried out a wave of air strikes on Douma on Friday and Saturday that killed nearly 100 people, including many who suffered breathing difficulties. Syria and its Russian ally denounced the claims as “fabrications”, with Russia warning of potential “dire consequences” if they were used as a pretext for military action. US President Donald Trump warned there would be a “big price to pay”. “Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “President (Vladimir) Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay.” United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was “particularly alarmed” by the attack, adding that if confirmed, the use of chemical weapons would be “abhorrent”. Britain called for an investigation into what it said were the “deeply disturbing” reports, and Turkey, which has backed rebels against Assad, said it had a “strong suspicion” the Syrian president was to blame. France has repeatedly said that evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria could prompt military action and said on Sunday it would “do its duty” following the latest allegations. It called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting. Pope Francis described the allegations as “terrible news”, saying: “Nothing, nothing can justify the use of such devices of extermination against defenceless people and populations.” White House security adviser Tom Bossert refused to rule out US military action in response to the alleged chemical strike. “I wouldn’t take anything off the table,” he said. US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the reports, if confirmed, “are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community.” Prominent Republican senator Lindsey Graham warned Trump that a failure to act now could leave him in a weakened posture internationally. “It’s a defining moment in his presidency,” Graham said. A chemical attack with the nerve agent sarin in the Eastern Ghouta enclave in August 2013 killed 1 429 people, including children, the US says. Sarin was also detected in an April 2017 attack on the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhun that killed more than 80 people. The agent was released after an air strike. Helicopter-dropped chlorine-filled munitions have been increasingly used by the regime as the conflict has dragged on, according to a 2017 report by Human Rights Watch. — AFPGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

The White House later said the president misspoke and expressed “regret”.Polish leaders termed the error “hurtful” and said it required more than a mere expression of regret.The linguistic faux pas overshadowed Obama’s posthumous award of the highest US civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to Jan Karski, a Polish underground officer who provided the Allies with early eyewitness accounts of Nazi Germany’s genocide against European Jews.Making the letter public on Friday, Komorowski - who on Wednesday publicly urged Obama to cooperate in “correcting this unfortunate error” - said he was satisfied with the “rapid” expression of regret by “our important ally and good friend”.Obama specified “there were simply no Polish death camps” in the letter to Komorowski.He admitted to “inadvertently” using the phrase “rather than ‘a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland.’”“The killing centres at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Belzec, Treblinka, and elsewhere in occupied Poland were built and operated by the Nazi regime.\nIn contrast, many Poles risked their lives - and gave their lives - to save Jews from the Holocaust,” Obama wrote.“The Polish people suffered terribly under the brutal Nazi occupation during World War II,” he noted.“In pursuit of destroying the Polish nation and Polish culture and extermination European Jewry, the Nazi killed some six million Polish citizens, including three million Polish Jews during the Holocaust,” he added.Poland’s government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as “Polish” because it says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust. – Sapa-AFPGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

The rapes, sometimes by several men, often occurred in front of family members.\n\"The stories we've heard, talking to Syrian women, are truly horrific,\" said Sanj Srikanthan, emergency field director of the International Rescue Committee in the UK.\n\"Many of these women have experienced rape and torture in Syria, but as refugees [they] can't find the support they need to heal their physical and emotional scars – let alone provide food and shelter for their families.\"\nDuring interviews with 240 Syrian women and girls in Lebanon and Jordan, the committee learned of attacks involving kidnap, rape, torture and murder, with Syria's many roadblocks a particular danger.\nSexual violence recurence\nThe International Rescue Committee said it was impossible to give figures, but its report draws attention to the use of rape as a strategy in war. Sexual violence occurs in every humanitarian crisis, notably during the Balkan wars and in conflicts in parts of Africa, and Syria is no exception.\nIn a report in June, Human Rights Watch said Syria's government forces used sexual violence to torture men, women and boys detained in the conflict.\nLast year, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative to highlight these issues. The foreign office assembled a team of 70 doctors, lawyers, forensic experts and psychologists who can be deployed to conflict areas.\nHague told Parliament last week that the UK is sending specialists to deal with rape and sexual violence in Syria.\n\"We've deployed experts to the region to provide training in how to respond to reports of sexual violence, to improve the prospect of future investigation and prosecutions, and we will intensify this work as a matter of urgency,\" he said.\nEstimated death toll\nMembers of the team will train local health professionals to gather medical and forensic evidence and documentation that can be used in prosecutions. Hague said in the past Britain would use its presidency of the G8 group of industrialised countries this year to push for a new international protocol on the investigation and documentation of sexual violence in conflict.\nThe UN estimated the death toll during nearly two years of civil war in Syria at 60 000. More than 2.5-million people, from a population of 22.5-million, fled their homes, with 612 000 people registered as refugees in neighbouring countries.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees agency said on Friday that harsh winter conditions, including freezing rain, made life even more difficult for refugees.\nThe UN World Food Programme in the past warned it was unable to deliver food to up to one-million hungry and desperate Syrians because of spiralling violence across the country and a lack of fuel. The UN appealed for $1.5-billion for the first six months of this year – the largest short-term UN appeal – but it remained seriously underfunded.\nThe International Rescue Committee said aid was drastically insufficient to meet existing needs, let alone the barest requirements to respond to a lengthy humanitarian emergency and post-conflict recovery.\nStates of refuge\nRefugee camps gained much media attention, yet most Syrian refugees are in towns and cities in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey, the committee added. In a grim irony, Iraq and Syria have reversed their previous roles as states of refuge.\nIraq now hosts 67 000 refugees, whereas five years ago Iraqis fled to Syria. Lebanon has received more than 200 000 Syrian refugees, Jordan 176 500 and Turkey more than 148 000.\n\"While some Syrians are housed by host families in cramped quarters, most are renting small, dilapidated unfurnished apartments that they increasingly cannot afford,\" said the committee.\n\"Others find shelter in sheds, barns, basements and abandoned buildings unfit for habitation. Some are offered shelter by local authorities in unused public spaces.\"\nUrban refugees are straining the education, health and water facilities of host countries. Rents have gone up for both refugees and locals, and tension is on the rise.\nThe committee's report also described the deliberate targeting of medical and health care facilities by the Syrian government. Doctors told the committee of a systematic campaign to restrict access to health care through strategic bombing, forcing the closure of hospitals.\nThe International Rescue Committee urged donors to significantly increase bilateral aid to host countries to help offset the strain on their infrastructure and ease tension. The US gave $100-million to Jordan, but the committee said donors should give more to Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.\nThe body said donors must recognise sexual violence as a feature of the Syrian conflict, as well as the threats Syrian women and girls face as refugees and the shortage of quality services available to them, and develop an appropriate strategy to address the crisis. – © Guardian News and Media 2013 We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

But it will be a huge step towards this end.”Since it began in March 2011, the war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half the population homeless and created the world’s worst refugee crisis.Government forces scored an important victory on Wednesday when the rebels retreated from the Old City, the historic heart of Aleppo.They extended their advances later in the day, seizing the Bab al-Nayrab, al-Ma’adi and al-Salhin neighbourhoods, according to state media.More neighbourhoods were expected to fall soon, but rebels were fighting ferociously.Syria state television reported that rebel shelling killed 14 civilians and wounded 70 others, some critically, targeting government-held districts in west Aleppo.In a blistering three-week offensive, Syrian forces have seized about 80% of east Aleppo, a stronghold for rebel groups since 2012.Increasingly cornered in a pocket of territory in the city’s southeast, opposition factions on Wednesday called for an “immediate five-day humanitarian ceasefire”.When asked about the possibility of a truce in Aleppo, al-Assad said, “it’s practically nonexistent, of course”.“The Americans in particular are insisting on demanding a truce, because their terrorist agents are now in a difficult situation,” al-Assad told al-Watan.He said a rebel loss in Aleppo “will mean the transformation of the course of the war across Syria”.Russia is in favour of continuing contacts between United States Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in an effort to reach a deal over Aleppo, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.He said the prospects for an agreement were unclear: “As previously, there are more questions than answers.” Lavrov and Kerry met in Hamburg, Germany, on Wednesday.\nA US official said they probably discussed a safe passage for rebels out of Aleppo.“The Russians want the fighters out and they [the Americans] are ready to co-ordinate over that,” said an official with an Aleppo rebel group, who declined to be named.Although rebels say they could fend off the offensive for some time to come, the fighting is complicated by tens of thousands of fearful civilians trapped in the rebel-held east, many related to the fighters, the official said.“The civilian burden is very heavy, in a small area.”Many people have also streamed from areas rebels have left and are crammed into abandoned homes while air raids and shellfire fall around them, hoping to escape before Aleppo is retaken.A United Nations official said about 31 500 people from east Aleppo have been displaced around the city over the past week, with hundreds more seen on the move on Wednesday.Residents say up to 20 000 people have fled their homes in recent days for other opposition areas. About 18 000 people had sought refuge in government-held areas, the UN said last week. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the number was probably in the tens of thousands.As winter sets in, siege conditions are increasingly desperate, exacerbated by the high number of displaced residents.With hospitals, clinics, water and food supplies cut off, UN chief Ban Ki-moon called the situation heartbreaking. — Al Jazeera, ReutersGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

The opposition frontSome 50 delegates representing different factions within the Syrian opposition arrived in the Swiss city of Geneva over the weekend in preparation for the talks.The unity of the opposition front will be put to the test on Tuesday.\nDisagreement over the future role of President Bashar al-Assad in a transitional government has considerably weakened the opposition’s capability to negotiate a favourable way out of the crisis over the past few months.Statements issued by the opposition after a two-day meeting in Riyadh last week did not clarify how this critical issue would play out.According to a statement issued by the Riyadh conference on Friday, “the participants stressed that the transition cannot happen without the departure of Bashar al-Assad and his circle at the start of the interim period”. Hours later, however, Nasr Hariri, the new chief negotiator for the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), Syria’s main opposition group, told reporters that the opposition was ready to discuss “everything on the negotiating table” without preconditions.Early last week, Hariri replaced Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister, who led the HNC for almost two years. Hijab, a hardliner, hinted in a statement that the HNC had faced pressure to make concessions in favour of Assad. His departure led to speculation that the group may soften its stance towards the Syrian president and his role in the transitional period.Significantly, Hijab’s resignation came as Assad made a televised appearance next to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, where the Russian leader, a staunch supporter of Assad, held a meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss the Syria crisis.“It is important to reach a political settlement now, and Assad is ready to work with anyone who wants peace,” said the Russian president, who later announced he would convene a Syria Congress at the beginning of December in Sochi.Appearing strong in the wake of the successful fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group ( ISIL, also known as ISIS) and major territorial gains after two years of Russian and Iranian military interventions that reversed the conquests of the opposition, Assad now has the upper hand in the negotiations. Lasting conflictAnalysts were sceptical that the Geneva talks would make any progress towards a political settlement.“There will not be a formal Geneva-style diplomatic settlement, whether under UN auspices or other,” said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. According to Sayigh, the Russia-backed Astana talks, a parallel track to the UN-sponsored peace process, aim to reintegrate the Syrian opposition under the current state system.Marwan Kabalan, an analyst with the Doha Institute, noted that the fate of Assad would long remain a contentious issue: “A significant part of the country in the north and south, holding most of the oil and water reserves, is not under the control of the regime. This means the conflict will last much, much longer than people expect.”The final communique from the opposition in Riyadh focused primarily on rejecting Iran’s interference in Syria. Saudi Arabia has thrown its weight behind a number of opposition groups and has pushed for the removal of Assad in a bid to contain Iran’s growing hegemony in the region.But the Sochi meeting was emblematic of a new geopolitical reality, wherein Assad and his allies will continue to play a dominant role in Syria and the rest of the region. Humanitarian crisisSyria’s civil war , now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world’s worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.In its 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview on Syria , published last week, the UN said that the scale and severity of needs across Syria remain overwhelming. Some 13 million people require humanitarian assistance, including 5.6 million in acute need due to limited access to basic goods and services.Of the 5.5 million Syrian refugees worldwide, most of whom remain in neighbouring countries, a very limited number have returned to Syria. In 2017, around 720,000 people returned to their areas of origin. — Al JazeeraGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(AFP)The department of international relations and co-operation would not go so far as to support the growing calls for boycotts of Israel in the wake of escalating international anger about the country’s attack on Syria, even though it has condemned the air strikes on the civil war-ridden country.More than 70 000 people have died in the two-year-long Syrian civil war. South Africa’s policy on Syria has rarely strayed from that of its Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China) partners – it will not support any moves to remove President Bashar al-Assad.On Wednesday, the department said it condemned the strikes but maintained its support of the sovereignty of Syria, and that a military solution to the conflict is not possible.South Africa has said it would not support sanctions of any kind against Syria or Israel, in spite of calls for boycotts on home soil.Kathrada's 'surprise'\nThis week, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada called on actor Morgan Freeman to explain his decision to accept an Israeli award.\nFreeman was nominated for the Key of Knowledge award by the Canadian Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem on Monday. The award was purportedly for his philanthropic work.Tutu reportedly wrote to Freeman to ask him to explain his decision to accept the award. Kathrada, meanwhile, wrote to Freeman expressing his “surprise” that he had accepted the award. Both Tutu and Kathrada are openly opposed to Israel's oppression of Palestine.World-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking joined their call this week by joining an academic boycott of Israel. Hawking had initially accepted an invitation to speak at a conference hosted by Israel's President Shimon Peres.The British Committee for the Universities of Palestine published a statement, reportedly with Hawking’s backing, saying he had changed his mind about attending the conference based on his knowledge of Palestine, and upon the advice of his Palestinian contacts.South Africa previously condemned Israeli attacks on Palestine without supporting boycotts of Israel.Department of international relations spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the second and third air strikes against Syria constituted a “serious” breach of international law.“These attacks are an extremely dangerous escalation of the crisis in Syria, which could have dire implications for the stability of the entire Middle East region. South Africa calls for calm and implores countries of the region to refrain from further military action,” Monyela said. 'Disastrous consequences'\nMonyela said any foreign involvement or military action in Syria would have “disastrous consequences for the region”. “It is further essential that the supply of foreign weapons to all parties in Syria be stopped as it results in the increasing militarisation of the conflict.“South Africa has persistently called on all the parties in the conflict to stop the violence as well as respect and protect the rights of the Syrian population,\" he said.“Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, South Africa has condemned all human rights abuses in particular violations of the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and children. All the parties in the current conflict have the responsibility to protect and preserve human rights.“South Africa reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria and maintains that any political transition must reflect the will of the Syrian people. South Africa rejects any calls for regime change and outside military interference or any action not in line with the Charter of the United Nations,” Monyela said. He said the country further supports the efforts of the joint special envoy of the United Nations and League of Arab States, Lakhdar Brahimi, “towards moving the parties to the negotiating table\".“The only sustainable resolution to the conflict is if the parties agree, without precondition, to meet each other in dialogue to discuss the future Syrian political dispensation along the lines agreed to in the Geneva Communiqué of 2012,” Monyela said. 'Provocation'\nANC deputy secretary general Jesse Duarte also condemned Israel's attacks, calling them a “provocation” that would only escalate hostilities in the region.“We believe that the cessation of hostilities by all protagonists is a precondition for the evasive attempt to save lives and bring about lasting peace,” she said. The party, like the international relations department, was quick to point out its support for the sovereignty of Syria.  “We call on the United Nations to prevail on external forces to respect the sovereignty of Syria and to allow Syrians to work together in resolving their disputes,” she said.South Africa joined its other two Brics partners, Brazil and India, in abstaining from the 2011 UN Security Council vote, along with Lebanon. Opponents of the resolution, like South Africa, refuse to condemn the Assad regime. Further developments saw India, Brazil and South Africa again refusing to condemn the Assad regime.No military solution\nIn July last year, Deputy Minister of International Relations Ebrahim Ebrahim said South Africa believed there was no military solution to the conflict. \"The international community must urgently respond to the escalating violence in Syria in a stern and balanced manner, based on the realities on the ground.  It is incumbent on the UN Security Council to express strong and unified support for Mr [Kofi] Annan and to call on all parties to cease the violence immediately.\"The UN charter after all determines that the Security Council should make proposals for conflict resolution and address failures of implementation with its decisions, and that it should do so: 'without prejudice to the rights, claims and positions of the parties concerned'. \"South Africa will therefore support any decision of the Security Council that is balanced and geared towards supporting Mr Annan’s call for all sides in the conflict to adhere to their commitments under his six point plan,” Ebrahim said.An Algerian diplomat replaced Annan at the helm of the UN Arab League Special Envoy to Syria in September last year.In March this year, reports emerged that a missile – a chemical weapon – was fired into a Syrian province, killing 31 people and injuring a further 100. Again, South Africa held its line by condemning the violence and the use of chemical weapons; it said there was no military solution to the crisis in Syria, but it would not call for Assad to step down. Ebrahim said in March that “South Africa reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria\".\"The only way to stop the further destruction of Syrian society is for the parties to come together in dialogue without delay.\"Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Reuters)\"There are no winds of war,\" Yair Golan, the general commanding Israeli forces on the Syrian and Lebanese fronts, told reporters while out jogging with troops. \"Do you see tension? There is no tension. Do I look tense to you?\" he said, according to the Maariv NRG news website.Intelligence sources said Israel attacked Iranian-supplied missiles stored near the Syrian capital on Friday and Sunday as they awaited transport to Assad's Lebanese guerrilla ally Hezbollah.Israel has repeatedly warned it will not let high-tech weaponry get to Iranian-backed Hezbollah, with which it fought an inconclusive war in 2006. Damascus accused Israel of belligerence meant to support outgunned anti-Assad rebels.The air strikes were tantamount to a \"declaration of war\", it said, and threatened unspecified retaliation.Veteran Israeli lawmaker Tzachi Hanegbi, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Monday that Israel did not want to clash with Assad.Interviewed on Israel Radio, Hanegbi said the Netanyahu government aimed to avoid \"an increase in tension with Syria by making clear that if there is activity, it is only against Hezbollah, not against the Syrian regime\".Israel is reluctant to take sides in Syria's civil war for fear its actions would boost Islamists who are even more hostile to it than the Assad family, which has maintained a stable stand off with the Jewish state for decades.Hanegbi said Israel had not formally acknowledged carrying out the raids in an effort to allow Assad to save face, adding that Netanyahu began a scheduled week-long trip to China on Sunday to signal the sense of business as usual.The Israel prime minister did not comment about Syria during a visit to Shanghai on Monday.'Diplomatic channels'\nYedioth Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, said the Netanyahu government had informed Assad through diplomatic channels that it did not intend to meddle in Syria's civil war.Israeli officials did not immediately confirm the report, but one suggested that such indirect contacts were not required.\"Given the public remarks being made by senior Israeli figures to reassure Assad, it's pretty clear what the message is,\" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Al-Ikhbariya, a pro-government Syrian television station, on Sunday said Assad had rockets ready to fire at Israel if it struck again.Damascus would also permit guerrilla attacks against Israel across the Golan Heights, Al-Ikhbariya said.\nHanegbi said Israel was ready for any development if the Syrians misinterpreted its messages and was ready \"to respond harshly if indeed there is aggression against us\".As a precaution, Israel deployed two of its five Iron Dome rocket interceptors near the Syrian and Lebanese fronts and grounded civilian aircraft in the area, although an Israeli military spokesperson said the airspace would reopen on Monday.Analysts say Syria would be no match for Israel, a US defence ally, in any military showdown. But Damascus, with its leverage over Hezbollah, could still consider proxy attacks through Lebanon. Tehran, which has long backed Assad, whose Alawite minority has religious ties to Shi'ite Islam, denied Israel's attack was on arms. Shi'ite Hezbollah did not comment. – ReutersGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Antonio, Pampliega, AFP)After two years of civil war in Syria, more than 70 000 men, women and children have been killed, according to the United Nations.Nonprofit organisations from around the world have been flocking to the Syrian border, but many are turned away, as the government of Bashar al-Assad has cracked down on international humanitarian entering the country.But there are some, including South Africans, who manage to get inside, and make their difference in the war, which began when government forces killed several civilians at a protest for the release of political prisoners.One of these South Africans is 29-year-old Venessa Naidoo, an anaesthetist who works with Médecins Sans Frontières.Naidoo, who is currently furthering her studies at the University of Cape Town, has been on missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan under threat of bombs, and in South Sudan, operating out of a tent.Recently, she spent a few months in the north of Syria, where she worked with a Belgian doctor and two nurses in a makeshift hospital run out of a chicken farm.\"That's not the worst though,\" she tells the Mail \u0026 Guardian. \"We used to operate in a cave.\nBut with all the shelling, it became unsustainable to stay in the cave.\"Hands-on experience\nBut she sees humanitarian medical assistance as the \"best work\" she's ever done.\"The training we get in South Africa is perfect for working in the field,\" she says.\"When you do your community service in the rural areas, you have to learn to cope on your own. Young doctors often complain about this, but it's this kind of confidence that you need when there's no one to call on for help. A lot of people who train overseas don't get the same hands-on experience that we get.\"Naidoo learnt her skills running a rural hospital in Caledon with only two doctor colleagues.She says that it helps, funnily enough, that South African doctors are used to trauma, such as stab wounds, while European doctors aren't exposed to the same kind of violent injuries.\"Also, in South Africa, we do a lot of obstetrics training, right through our internships and community service. This really helps because as a female doctor, most women in Syria felt more comfortable with a woman in that regard.\"Naidoo can't say the name of the city the hospital was in, for security reasons.Since the government doesn't know they are there, they have to be smuggled in across the border unofficially.\"It's quite a process,\" she says. \"We have to cross from Turkey by foot. On the one side we meet with smugglers who take us over a mountain, through rivers, it's quite a hike. Once we are on the other side, we get fetched by contacts in Syria and then taken to the hospital.\"They cannot set up shop at a normal hospital, she says, because government forces still target hospitals, which makes them unsafe.Winter months\nWorking on the farm means that during the winter months, the hospital is freezing cold, and impossible to heat because fuel is too expensive and there is no electricity.Naidoo talks about the types of injuries she saw during the war. \"We were working in an opposition-controlled area which was often targeted by government forces,\" she says.\"The government forces use a form of shelling called drumming, which is where they fill large metal drums with any type of metal they can find, which they drop over the area, and it then explodes in the air or on land. The shrapnel flies everywhere, and they really put anything they can find in those drums. Once I even saw a man with a pair of pliers sticking out of him.\"She also regularly sees gunshot wounds from Kalashnikovs and AK-47s, as well as injuries from mortar fire.It is civilians that she sees most, who are affected by the fighting.\"In one mass casualty, 50 people came in at once. A 13-year-old girl died.\"In addition to the war injuries, the high levels of stress means that many more people suffer from heart attacks and anxiety attacks.Many people also come in with burn wounds, because they are making fires out of wood for the first time in their lives, and for motor vehicle injuries, as people panic on the roads when they see a helicopter overhead.Women bear the brunt\n​She says it is the women who bear the brunt of the war.\"I really felt for the women – the men go off and fight but the women are left behind and have to fight to survive and to feed their families. It is difficult to get food or fuel, especially when it is snowing. Lots of them used to farm, but the farms have been destroyed by the bombs. They see helicopters flying over head and they don't know where it's going to drop a bomb, or which way the wind will blow the shell.\"She says that many women end up nursing their own family members and even have to carry out amputations. Many have babies at home because they are afraid of going to state hospitals, for fear that their babies will be killed.Naidoo is also very passionate about the children of Syria. \"When I see children come into the hospital, I get angry,\" she says.\"One day that stands out for me is seeing a truckload of rebel fighters driving down the road, and they were singing and shouting with their Kalashnikovs in the air. Behind them was a stream of children with wooden guns, running after them and cheering them on. It struck me how abnormal that is, but this is what is normal for these four and five-year-olds, who are used to the bombing and shelling. That wasn't my childhood. Kids shouldn't be involved in a war, but they are and there is nothing we can do to protect them.\"This type of trauma naturally has its effect on the doctors involved in saving lives.\"Part of the process of dealing with the experience is this, drawing attention to what's happening,\" Naidoo says.\"We can't stop the war, but access to health is a basic human right. We debriefed all the time – during the mission and after.\"In spite of everything, the Syrian people we worked with were really wonderful people. Even though they are struggling to survive, every other night they would invite us over for supper.

(Misha Japaridze, AP)A diplomatic source said he would also see Iran's foreign minister.Russia and Iran have been the staunchest allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad throughout an armed uprising against his rule, and any understandings they might reach with Assad's foes could help overcome the two sides' refusal to negotiate.At an annual international security conference in Munich, Syrian National Coalition leader Moaz Alkhatib had talks with Russia's Sergei Lavrov that may have been made possible by Alkhatib signalling readiness to talk to Damascus.He also met separately with US Vice President Joe Biden and United Nations (UN) special envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi.\"Russia has a certain vision but we welcome negotiations to alleviate the crisis and there are lots of details that need to be discussed,\" Alkhatib said after the meeting.A diplomatic source said the Alkhatib would also meet Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, who was attending the Munich security conference on Saturday, but this could not be independently confirmed.Russia has blocked three UN Security Council resolutions aimed at pushing out Assad out or pressuring him to end the civil war, in which more than 60 000 people have died.But Moscow has also tried to distance itself from Assad by saying it is not trying to prop him up and will not offer him asylum.\"The talks about Syria are intensifying and the Iranians have been drawn in. Let's see how it all ends,\" the diplomatic source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Big signalAlkhatib put his authority within the opposition movement at risk earlier this week when he broke ranks to say he would be willing to meet Syrian officials to discuss a transition if political prisoners arrested during the uprising were freed.The opposition coalition's 12-member politburo then told Alkhatib not to respond to any proposals made in Munich without consulting with them first, with one opposition source citing concern that Alkhatib's move would damage the revolt's morale.Outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Alkhatib's apparent readiness to meet Assad envoys outside Syria, calling him \"not only courageous but smart\".She also voiced concern that Iran had recently increased military support for Assad.While some headway was apparently being made in Munich, Iranian media said that Saeed Jalili of Iran's Supreme National Security Council had travelled to Damascus to meet officials and help Assad \"stand against plots hatched by global arrogance\" – an allusion to the United States and other Western powers.A comment by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev this week that Assad's chances of staying in power were getting \"smaller and smaller\" was regarded in some quarters as a sign of a shift in the Kremlin's Syria policy.At the same time, Syrian opposition figure Hassan Bali, in Munich as an independent observer, called Alkhatib's meeting with Biden \"a big signal from the Americans\" that they were upgrading support for rebels fighting to topple Assad.Biden said in Munich that although there was still no international agreement, nobody could doubt \"the increasingly desperate plight of the Syrian people and the responsibility of the international community to address that plight\".There was little evidence at the Munich conference that the U.S.\nand Russian positions on Assad were getting any closer.\"The persistence of those who say that priority number one is the removal of Assad is the single biggest reason for the continuing tragedy in Syria,\" Lavrov told the conference.Biden on the other hand said the White House was \"convinced that President Assad, a tyrant hell-bent on clinging to power, is no longer fit to lead Syrian people and he must go\".Russia is Assad's main arms supplier and, with Iran, has been among his strongest supporters during the 22-month-old conflict, which began with peaceful protests and evolved into civil war after Assad tried to crush unrest by military force. – Reuters.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(AFP)\nThe man who helped bring independence to East Timor saw a dangerous mix in Syria, saying the rebels lacked democratic credentials and President Bashar al-Assad was determined to fight for the survival of himself and his community.\n\"It is becoming a vicious civil war involving many – too many – outside interests, governments and non-state interests,\" Ramos-Horta said on a visit to the US.\n\"We are going to see a prolonged civil war, almost a Somalisation of Syria, but in a much more dangerous region of the world. Unfortunately I cannot see a better scenario,\" he said.\nSomalia has been bereft of a central government and torn by fighting for two decades.\nRamos-Horta said another parallel to Syria was the Iran-Iraq War, with the 1980-1988 war leaving more than one million dead and ending \"only when both sides were exhausted\".\nRamos-Horta, who has been active on international peace initiatives, said the US and European nations were right to treat Syria's opposition cautiously. But he said it was \"too simplistic\" to pin blame on Russia and China, which have blocked Western-led UN bids to pressure Assad.\nAssad has ample firepower and there is \"no incentive for the regime to back down\" after witnessing the killing of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and the prosecution of Egypt's deposed president Hosni Mubarak, he said.\nChance for change\nRamos-Horta said that the only chance for change in Syria would come from the military, calling it instrumental in pushing out strongmen such as Mubarak and Suharto in Indonesia as well as allowing recent reforms in Myanmar.\n\"I was hoping that in Syria, countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the others, instead of adding fuel to the fire, were to make a greater effort to entice the military to do the honourable thing – and that is to tell Assad time to go,\" Ramos-Horta said.\nThe Sunni monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been widely reported to be providing weapons to Syria's rebels at the forefront of an initially peaceful push to end the four-decade rule of the Assad family, which hails from the heterodox Alawite community.\nPresident Barack Obama's administration has urged Assad to step down but said that it is only offering non-lethal assistance to the rebels, despite calls by some members of the rival Republican Party to arm the opposition.\nRamos-Horta voiced concern over revenge attacks on Alawites, saying that centrists in the opposition \"will be cast aside, eaten up, swallowed by the revolution, even considered to be traitors for trying to pursue a prudent and moderate path.\"\n\"Unfortunately, not everybody thinks like the Indonesians or like us ... that we have the ability of letting bygones be bygones,\" he said.\nDozens of attacks\nSyrian air force planes on Monday launched dozens of attacks from Damascus to Aleppo as the truce declared for the Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday ended as it began – in violence.\nOpposition activists reported 48 air strikes in a few hours while the UN and Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, admitted that the four-day ceasefire had failed. \"The situation is bad and getting worse,\" he told reporters in Moscow after talks with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Russia is Syria's closest and most supportive ally at the UN.\nAir raids were reported overnight from the Damascus suburbs of Qaboun, Zamalka and Irbin and described by residents as the heaviest since planes and helicopters first bombarded pro-opposition parts of the Syrian capital in August.\nIn Jermana, near Damascus, a car bomb killed 11 people, including women and children, and injured 50 others, Syrian state media reported, blaming \"terrorists\" for deliberately breaching the truce.\nFighting was also reported from Homs, Idlib and Deir al-Zour on the Iraqi border.\nThe truce, for Eid al-Adha, the Muslim feast of the sacrifice which marks the end of the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, began on Friday morning. An estimated 400 people have died during it. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 110 people were killed on Sunday alone. Of those, 39 were civilians, 34 armed opposition fighters and 35 members of the state security forces, said the UK-based group.\nWarring parties\nShelling and car bombings resumed hours after the ceasefire had been due to take effect on Friday, with each side blaming the other for breaking it.\nIts chances seemed poor from the start in the absence of enthusiasm from the warring parties or any independent mechanism for monitoring and enforcement.\nBrahimi, the veteran Algerian diplomat who succeeded Kofi Annan as the international Syria envoy in September, said he was continuing his mission despite the grim situation. \"I have said and it bears repeating again and again that the Syrian crisis is very, very dangerous, the situation is bad and getting worse. If it's not a civil war, I don't know what it is.\"\nBrahimi is to go to the UN Security Council in November with new proposals to push for talks between al-Assad and the opposition. He is also due to visit China on Tuesday. Beijing has followed Moscow in blocking any action against Syria at the UN.\nBrahimi had hoped that the Eid truce might lead to a longer-term ceasefire and pave the way for a political solution of the conflict that has claimed 35 000 lives, according to opposition groups.\nIts failure points to the determination of the regime to continue its security strategy and to what many see as the dangerous fragmentation of the anti-Assad forces. \"It's not just about the Syrian military and the army defectors who form the backbone of the Free Syrian Army rebel group anymore,\" said Hassan Abdul-Azim, of the Damascus-based National Co-ordination Bureau. He told reporters that there were so many foreign fighters and other external factors involved in Syria that only an agreement among international and regional powers could end 19 months of fighting.\n'Political process'\nLavrov said Moscow was also \"disappointed\" that the ceasefire was not respected but said there was no point disputing who breached it. He emphasised Russia's position that the crisis will be resolved once western powers and neighbouring countries such as Turkey start negotiating with Assad, not just the opposition. \"Hardly anything will be accomplished without dialogue with the [Syrian] government, and that is the only problem that remains in the path towards a political process,\" he said.\nMoscow has repeatedly criticised western powers for what it says are obstructions of peace efforts in Syria. Last week it alleged the US was co-ordinating arms deliveries to the rebels, which the state department has called \"ludicrous\".\nBan Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said he was \"deeply disappointed\" that the fighting had not stopped. \"This crisis cannot be solved with more weapons and bloodshed. The guns must fall silent.\"\nSyrian opposition figures, including FSA commanders, started three days of talks in Istanbul on Monday in the latest attempt to unite disparate groups.\nIn a separate development, the Turkish military fired back after a shell from Syria landed near the village of Besaslan in the southern province of Hatay, state media said, amid clashes between Syrian soldiers and rebels in the nearby border town of Harim.

You’re sure he’s dead?”Seven years had passed with no news, but Salwa could hardly believe her nephew, a Syrian activist arrested in 2011, had been dead in the last five years.The civil records employee shuffling through papers at her desk said: “Yes, we received the names of everyone who died inside prison.”Tens of thousands of people are estimated to be held in regime jails across Syria, with relatives and advocates saying they are often tortured, denied fair trial, and deprived contact with families.Their relatives are left in limbo, spending years and precious savings shuttling between security services to know where loved ones are held or if they are even alive.A growing number of families, in different areas in Syria, are being informed of the death of their children in the prisons of the Syrian regime through mere coincidence. One would be issuing some formal paper work to discover that his detained son or brother in state prison, is registered dead under the civil registry.As words started to spread, people started to flood the state civil departments to check for a detained relative status in the official registry with queues backing up for hours.Bashar Al Assad last month ordered prisons and detaining centers to update their registries, but people never expected that death certificates would not reach them, and that they would have to find out by coincidence.Now, activists and families of imprisoned Syrians say the regime has quietly updated civil records to mark detainees as “deceased”, backdating deaths to as long ago as 2013.The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) estimates 80,000 Syrians were ‘made to disappear’ by the regime.“Before, the regime would give no details on the detained. It wouldn’t declare them dead,” head of the Syrian Network for Human Rights Abdul Gani told AFP. “Now it is, but in a barbaric way.”The city of Hama’s records were updated first, followed by Homs, the capital Damascus, Latakia and Hasakeh, and new names are still arriving at registries, the SNHR said.In seven years of documenting Syria’s uprising-turned-war, Abdul Gani said he had never before seen families learn of the fate of the detainees in this way. “Usually, you take a death certificate to the registry and inform them your relative is dead, not the other way around,” he said.Death certificates were sent from the Ministry of Interior to the Civil Registry Department and then to the Civil Registry chapters in different cities. The certificates came mainly from Darayya, Ma’damiyeh and Hama prisons.  Death certificates were issued by the military hospitals. The cause stated was “death from contagious and infectious diseases.” Many former prisoners said fractures and open wounds caused by brutal torture sessions led to infectious diseases and death.Other death certificates stated: “On the basis of the decision of the First and Second Field Courts.” This meant they were executed after a the ruling by the Field Court.Salwa and her sister-in-law worried they’d be the only people at the registry asking about imprisoned relatives. “But when we got there, we saw a line out the door,” she said.“Most were women, mothers and sisters of detainees. Security forces stood among them, and every single woman was wiping her tears and covering her face with her scarf.”Weeping, Salwa went home to hold a single day of hushed condolences for two nephews: Sa’ad, arrested in 2011 and marked deceased in 2013, and Saeed, detained since 2012 and recorded to have died last year.The family had no bodies to bury and was afraid of grieving publicly in a regime-held city.“They scorched our hearts — those two boys were like roses. Even in mourning, we’re afraid and hide our grief,” Salwa said.The last time Islam Dabbas’s family saw him was late 2012, behind bars at a regime prison near Damascus.“We stopped hearing anything a while after that,” recalled his brother Abdul Rahman, who has since moved to Egypt.This month, a relative still in Syria learnt of the updated files and checked Islam’s.“It said he died on January 15, 2013 in Saydnaya,” Abdul Rahman said.“Honestly, it’s a relief. My mother told me, ‘He’s lucky. He’s at peace,’” Abdul Rahman said.They held condolences for Islam last week in Egypt, hundreds of kilometers from home and without a body.But confirming what many long suspected is not enough, said Noura Gazi, a Syrian lawyer and member of the detainee advocacy group Families for Freedom. “OK, you’ve told us they’re dead, but we want to know where the bodies are. We want to know the real way they died,” Gazi said. Others are hesitating.“People are so tired. Of course, there’s denial. Others are suspicious, saying ‘Why would we believe this document is real? Or this date to be true?’” said Gazi, who lives in Beirut.Her husband, activist Bassel Khartabil, vanished after his October 3, 2015 arrest. In 2017, through her networks, Gazi confirmed he died in regime detention.“I held condolences for him, I wore black. I thought I had processed the truth,” she said.That changed when a relative of Khartabil visited a Damascus registry in early July and saw the regime’s freshly-recorded date of death: October 5, 2015.“When we saw that, it’s like he died all over again,” said Gazi.“There’s no going back. For more than two years I fought to know his fate. Now I’ll be fighting my whole life to get his body.”The heaviest price paid in civil wars was by families, who live in limbo for years and years, looking for answers to the fate of their beloved, detained, kidnapped, or dead- With inputs from AFPMax - 36 °CMin - 17 °CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

It also happens to define both, former United States president Barack Obama’s and current President Donald Trump’s approaches to working with Russia on the Syrian civil war. Washington and Moscow have repeatedly issued joint statements outlining principles for addressing the conflict and reducing its horrific humanitarian consequences. Yet, over and over again, the Russians have betrayed their commitments.Consider the record. In November 2015, the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reached an agreement on the Vienna principles. They called for a cessation of hostilities; lifting the sieges on all cities; the unimpeded provision of food, medicine and other humanitarian materials; the drafting of a constitution in six months; and a political transition process of 18 months. In December 2015, these principles were enshrined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254. Syrian President Bashar Al Assad’s regime blatantly violated all of the terms: It lifted no sieges and did not allow humanitarian relief to pass unimpeded.The Russians, too, did nothing. Although Al Assad and the Russians did finally implement a ceasefire two months later, it collapsed by April 2016 as the Al Assad regime resumed its onslaught against civilian targets, with a special emphasis on hospitals. Much as in his use of chemical weapons, Al Assad hit hospitals to show that he would respect no limits. Kerry was reduced to condemning Al Assad’s attacks while plaintively appealing to Moscow to act on the responsibility enshrined in the December 2015 resolution. “We all signed the same agreement and we all supported the same UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for a nationwide cessation of hostilities,” he said, adding that “it calls for a nationwide, full delivery of humanitarian assistance within all of Syria”.Clear words, but no consequences. Not surprisingly, Kerry’s calls were in vain. By the autumn of 2016 he tried again, reaching an agreement on a joint operations centre with the Russians in the hope of reducing the violence and making a political process possible. Once again he was frustrated, declaring that he had “profound doubt about whether Russia and the Al Assad regime can or will live up to the obligations that they agreed to in Geneva”. The Russian response was to launch a scorched-earth attack on Aleppo, which reduced the eastern half of the city — then Syria’s largest — to rubble. That ended Kerry’s efforts.Trump has made his own attempts to get somewhere with the Russians. On the margins of the Group of 20 summit in Germany in July 2017, he and Putin finalised a ceasefire agreement for southwestern Syria. Trump met again with Putin in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, where they issued another joint statement on Syria. It emphasised the “importance of de-escalation areas as an interim step to reduce violence in Syria, enforce ceasefire agreements, facilitate unhindered humanitarian access, and set the conditions for the ultimate political solution to the conflict” on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.So how did the Russians act after that? Along with the Al Assad regime and the Iranians, they waged military campaigns that decimated and depopulated three of the four de-escalation areas. The fourth, the one Trump and Putin had agreed to in southwestern Syria, remained quiet — effectively freeing the Al Assad regime, with its Russian backers, to attack elsewhere.Lately, Al Assad and the Russians have turned their attention to southwestern Syria, bombing relentlessly. On June 21, the US State Department issued a blunt statement warning the Al Assad regime and the Russian government about “serious repercussions of these violations”. The Russians intensified their bombing, creating a new refugee flow with more than 270,000 people fleeing to the Jordanian and Israeli borders. Did Moscow face any “serious repercussions”? No — only Trump’s pursuit of a summit with Putin.Neither Obama nor Trump has been prepared to impose any consequences on the Russians. Both wanted to get out of Syria, not to be embroiled in it. And both permitted Putin to become the arbiter of events. So what should Trump do when he and Putin meet in Helsinki on July 16?He should make a virtue of necessity and convey the following points: That the US will maintain its small presence in Syria until Daesh is gone; that unless Iran’s continuing entrenchment in Syria is contained, it will trigger a wider war between Israel and the Iranians; and that the US will back the Israelis completely, making it in Putin’s interest to stop the expansion of the Iranians and their proxies in Syria and prevent a major regional escalation. Trump may even suggest that the Russians broker a set of red lines between the Israelis and Iranians in Syria.Indeed, Trump could also ask Putin to be his channel to the Iranians. Apart from limiting the potential for miscalculation with Tehran, it could give Putin a stake in coordinating with America on Iran. With the US having already conceded Syria to Russia, history tells us that America is unlikely to achieve more.— Washington PostDennis Ross, a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute, served in senior national security positions in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77dd694719c866a1b7093b"},"header":"The politics of reconstruction in Syria","time":"August 18, 2018   | Last updated 1 minute ago  ","content":"Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowDubai: As Syria’s seven-year civil war slowly wraps up a debate is raging on how to rebuild the war-torn country.Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, has arguably won the war—largely due to the support of his chief allies Russia and Iran. The ‘victory’, however, came at an enormous cost.While the international community typically steps up to provide reconstruction support when civil wars end, it has been reluctant to do so in Syria.“A number of Western states have been appalled at the way Al Assad has prosecuted this war,” Tamara Coffman Wittes, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution said in a recent podcast, pointing to his “willingness to ravage the entire country, displace half of the population, destroy civilian infrastructure and engage in massive war crimes, including the use of chemical weapons.”What started out in 2011 as a pro-democracy uprising against the Syrian regime—which had been in power for more than 40 years—quickly spiraled into a conflict which has been described the United Nations as the ‘greatest humanitarian catastrophe in modern times’.The repression of protests quickly turned violent as protesters were shot, arrested and tortured.Hundreds of deaths, turned into thousands. Entire neighbourhoods were flattened as protests mushroomed across the country at lightning speed.Then came sieges, starvation, barrel bombs, and chemical weapons.Desperate Syrian families threw their children into rubber dinghies and crossed the Mediterranean in order to reach Europe where they hoped they could secure a better future for their children—many drowned.International players joined the fight with each country investing in their own personal agendas which further complicated the conflict.This of course played to Al Assad’s advantage. He positioned himself as a bulwark against chaos and terrorism.Iran quickly jumped in to support him through its proxy militias, most importantly the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah. Migrants make their way on foot on the outskirts of Brezice, Slovenia October 20, 2015. Slovenia's interior ministry raised the possibility on Tuesday of setting up physical barriers along its southeastern border if the numbers of migrants increased. Reuters While it helped him in the short-term it was not enough to sustain his war efforts. At one point Al Assad’s grip on territory shrunk to only Damascus and his bastion on the Mediterranean, Latakia—it looked the his end was approaching.However, the tables turned in 2015 when Russia stepped into the fray—sending war planes and soldiers to hand Al Assad a decisive victory.Since then, the emboldened Syrian president has shown little interest in a politically negotiated solution to end the conflict—which killed more than a half a million people.Speaking to Gulf News, non-resident senior fellow at Brookings, Steven Heydemann, says he is doubtful Western states will be involved in the reconstruction process.“Western governments have shown impressive commitment to the principle of no funding without a meaningful, inclusive political transition. While some countries in Asia could be willing to provide support in exchange for economic benefits, there is no appetite in the West, at the moment for reconstruction.”But Al Assad’s international backers will sure to be rewarded by the Syrian regime for their support in what Heydemann describes as a “clear quid-pro-quo system”.Already some Russian firms have been handed contracts to rebuild lucrative oil fields damaged in the war—Iranian and Chinese firms have been handed reconstruction contracts as well.“Given how much Iran thinks its worth to have Al Assad in power, one would imagine that they have incentive to continue to entrench him through reconstruction,” Wittes says. A bulldozer removing rubble from war damage in the Lairamoun district of the Syrian city of Aleppo, among the most heavily destroyed urban areas in the seven-year civil war. AP“Also, its good business. Let’s not forget the scale of destruction is so vast—entire city blocks have been reduced to rubble. There is a lot of money to be made in rebuilding Syria,” she adds.Given the amount of money Russia and Iran invested in keeping Al Assad in power, rebuilding offers them a chance to recoup some of the profits from their investment, Wittes explains.However, the scale of destruction is so massive that such help will barely scratch the surface of the cost to rebuild which has been estimated to be between $100 to $300 billion. Al Assad, however, doesn’t seem to care.“He wants to control every aspect of reconstruction, even if that means he will not receive all the assistance he needs to do so,” Heydemann says.He cited new laws being passed by the regime, such as Law 10, which aims at re-organising and re-defining private and public real estate in Syria, especially in war-effected areas.In rebel Syria, a race to save precious property deedsThe law, which is yet to go into effect, gives owners a 30-day grace period to prove that they own a plot of land or home, by providing property documents either by showing up in person or through relatives up to the fourth degree.Those who fail to do so suffer the confiscation of their property and either its transferred into government hands or old at public auction.“There is a campaign underway by the regime to purchase properties from those it views as insufficiently loyal to the regime and to make those properties available to regime loyalists,” Heydemann said, predicting large scale demographic changes in the future.Another law being discussed would control which NGOs would be involved in the reconstruction process. Mohammed Bayraqdar sits with his son Abdul-Awal aon the staircase of their burned-out house in Khaldiyeh, one of the worst damaged neighborhoods in the Syrian city of Homs. APAll of this, Heydemann says, proves that the regime is not sincere its commitment to reconstruction but rather “is using the process as a way to solidify its control in the country”.“Al Assad’s goal is to use reconstruction to create what he calls a ‘healthier and more homogenous society’ with the intent to prevent the return of refugees,” Heydemann tells Gulf News.The Syrian president could be banking on the notion on the European fear that if it does not help out with the reconstruction, refugees living there will have little incentive to return home.Wittes describes it as a “chicken and the egg” scenario, where the West believes Al Assad’s exclusionary and repressive policies are the direct cause of radicalism and the proliferation of refugees.“The West is saying if you don’t fix yourself and reform with more inclusive political and economic structures, you will foment chaos and we don’t want to invest in that. But the regime is saying, ‘either help us or you will suffer with outflows of radicals and refugees’,” he says.It remains to be seen whether international players will buy into the argument. Wittes believes it will come down to who feels the pain first and who gives in.“Usually the internationally community steps in to rebuild after a civil war as a way to solidify peace and prevent the relapse of conflict and to create conditions which refugees could return home, but in Syria it fears such a move would solidify Al Assad’s rule over the wreck that is Syria,” Wittes says.“There is a concern that if support were to be provided to the Al Assad regime in the moment when he has achieved a decisive military victory over his opponents that he would take that as a signal to reimpose his authority and rebuild institutions even more repressive and exclusionary than before,” Heydemann says.Wittes agrees and says the case of Iraq should be studied as a cautionary tale.“From 2011 to 2014, US President Barack Obama was reducing US funds and presence in the country at a time where a very fragile sectarian agreement was holding Iraq together. Instead of constraining Iraqi premier Nouri Al Maliki from his sectarian policies, we leaned backed. This created the conditions for Daesh to emerge and US troops had to return to Iraq to fight the terrorist group,” she said.Wittes believes political reconciliation and inclusion is far more important than reconstruction.“Without this, Syria’s Sunni population will inevitably turn to extremist groups for protection.”She says that Al Assad may have won the war, but he’s setting the ground for the next round of conflict by creating the conditions for a backlash.Heydemann agrees adding that he is doubtful the Syrian regime will learn its lesson from what happened in Iraq.“Reconstruction is not just about removing rubble. Its about knitting back together a society that has become deeply polarised.”In the Syrian city of Homs’ landmark Clock Square, where some of the first anti-government protests erupted in 2011, stands a giant poster of a smiling President Bashar Al Assad waving his right arm, with a caption that reads: “Together we will rebuild.”Four years after the military brought most of the city back under Al Assad’s control, the government launched its first big reconstruction effort in Homs earlier this year, planning to erect hundreds of apartment buildings in three neighbourhoods in the devastated center of the city.It is a small start to the massive task of rebuilding Syria, where seven years of war, air strikes and barrel bombs have left entire cities and infrastructure a landscape of rubble.The government estimates reconstruction will cost some $200 billion dollars and last 15 years.Government workers have also begun clearing rubble from Daraya, one of the many Damascus suburbs wrecked by a long siege, to begin reconstruction.The government can cover $8 billion to $13 billion of the reconstruction costs, according to the Cabinet’s economic adviser, Abdul Qadir Azzouz.Recent Associated Press drone footage from Daraya outside Damascus and the city of Aleppo in the north shows scenes of destruction reminiscent of World War II devastation.East Aleppo, home to nearly 1.5 million before the war, is still largely empty and in ruins a year after it was recaptured from rebels.Small-scale renovation of government buildings and historical sites has barely begun to scratch the surface.In eastern Ghouta — an area with a pre-war population of some 400,000 — the United Nations did an assessment of satellite imagery from six of its seven districts and found more than 6,600 damaged buildings, more than 1,100 of which were totally destroyed. And that was before the latest government offensive, which has leveled even more homes and structures.For reconstruction overall, the Syrian government is trying to scrape together financing from Syrian businessmen and expatriates as well as international allies.It has also imposed a 0.5 percent reconstruction tax on some items, including restaurant bills.The Homs project gives an indication of the scale of the task.The plan focuses on three of the city’s most destroyed districts — Baba Amr, Sultanieh and Jobar — and will rebuild 465 buildings, able to house 75,000 people, at a cost of $4 billion, according to Homs’ governor, Talal Al Barrazi.It was not immediately clear how many housing units that entails — meaning individual apartments — but assuming there is on average five people per household, that would be around 15,000 units.That’s under half of the 35,000 housing units that were estimated to have been destroyed in Homs.And it’s a small fraction of the 1 million housing units Al Barrazi said Syria will need.Homs saw some of the worst destruction of the war as government forces for months blasted the string of neighbourhoods in the city’s center that were held by rebels.For the past four years, any rebuilding has largely been the work of individuals, with some help from the UN.In the devastated Khaldiyeh district, carpenters were fixing the windows and doors of Mohammad Bayraqdar’s charred apartment.The walls inside — even the chandeliers — were still blackened from the fighting years ago.The 38-year-old coffee vendor fled Khaldiyeh in 2011 and moved to his in-laws in a government-controlled part of the city.Late last year he informed the municipality that he wanted to return home.Once government architects checked that the building was suitable for living, repair work began with the help of a UN rebuilding programme.“Everyone should return to his home, even if it means living in one room only,” said Bayraqdar, standing on the roof overlooking a vista of flattened buildings.Outside Damascus, Daraya was left an empty ruin after all its population was removed in a deal last year that ended a destructive and grueling siege by Al Assad’s military.The suburb once had a population of 300,000 and was famous for its furniture, textiles, wood and vineyards, which produced some of Syria’s best grapes.“Almost all houses, factories, stores in Daraya remain skeletons,” said Daraya’s mayor, Marwan Obeid.He estimated rebuilding infrastructure alone will cost $160 million to $200 million. The government has so far allocated $70 million.The plan, he said, is to start moving some 100,000 people back into the less damaged half of Daraya.The rest of the community, however, is too ruined. Obeid said it was not known how long that will take to rebuild.-APMax - 36 °CMin - 17 °CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

But in the seven years since the regime of Bashar Al Assad set in motion the Syrian civil war, almost 500,000 people have died — well over 1,000 a week. The truth is that brutality is winning in Syria because the democratic powers are afraid to confront it.As for Al Assad’s allies, Iran and Russia, the latest deaths will certainly not make them reconsider their support for him. Russia had again blocked a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Syria before it later relented and the truce resolution was passed late on Saturday. Since the war began in 2011, Russia has vetoed 11 draft resolutions. Last week, it did not even need to veto, only to make clear that it would if the sponsors pushed their draft to a vote.As a permanent member of the security council, Russia has a special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Instead, in New York it has protected Al Assad against the consequences of his actions, including the use of chemical weapons; inside Syria, its forces have actively participated in attacks on hospitals and other prima facie war crimes. These atrocities have been well-documented.The response of western countries to the horrors in Syria is always the same: more statements deploring and condemning what has happened and appeals for an end to the violence. In the first two years of the conflict, the EU averaged almost one statement a week. The statements have become less frequent but no more effective. As the UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussain, said recently: “The conduct and management of this war has been utterly shameful from the outset and the failure to end it marks an epic failure of global diplomacy.”After seven years, it would be easy to conclude that there is nothing we can do, or that — in the words of Yes, Prime Minister’s Sir Humphrey Appleby — “maybe there was something we could have done, but it’s too late now”. Western countries could simply accept that the slaughter will go on until the vastly superior forces of Syria, Iran and Russia have wiped out or driven away all their enemies. But doing nothing in the face of massacres would not absolve the West of a share of responsibility for the bloodshed, any more than it did in Rwanda or Bosnia.Risk of destabilisationWestern leaders must also think about the impact on their own interests if the Syrian regime and its allies achieve victory and the only “political solution” in Syria is the reimposition of Al Assad’s autocratic rule throughout the country. Syria is not hermetically sealed from its neighbours or from Europe. There are already 5.5 million refugees outside Syria’s borders and more than 6 million internally displaced. Despite the aid the EU, the UK and other donors have given to support them, they will not be grateful to countries that would not tackle the source of their suffering. They will be ripe for exploitation by extremists and the countries that host the largest numbers — Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey — will be at risk of destabilisation.At a minimum, the West should do more to end the impunity of Syria’s leaders and their allies. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in December 2016 setting up a panel to assist in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for war crimes in Syria. Countries such as the UK that have laws allowing prosecutions for war crimes committed in other countries should work with the panel to open cases as soon as possible.If there is evidence to implicate Iranian or Russian forces in serious violations of international humanitarian law, then they also should be targeted for prosecution. Those most responsible for the suffering of the Syrian people over the last seven years should spend the rest of their lives looking over their shoulders.In addition, the EU and like-minded countries should step up sanctions against Russian individuals and companies involved in supporting the conflict in Syria.Many may already be sanctioned in connection with Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, but the EU should increase the pressure with asset freezes, travel bans and restrictions on EU firms doing business with Russian entities active in Syria.After failed interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, western politicians understandably do not want to talk to their voters about military action in Syria. Russia’s involvement is an added complication: no one wants to stumble into world war three, especially when many of those still fighting are the kind of violent extremists that western governments are combating at home. But when politicians say that there is no military solution in Syria, they are lying: there is a military solution and Al Assad, Khamenei and Putin are imposing it. The West can either try to stop them or wait until peace comes to Syria when Al Assad and Putin run out of people to kill.— Guardian News \u0026 Media LtdIan Bond is the director of foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedPakistan’s resilience is its strengthUS should watch out for the enemy withinAncient Syria river sections off modern warChomsky: Israel’s support erodes in AmericaFor balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Al Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in ...Trump’s admission that he has taken occupied Jerusalem ...Holiday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

It’s not","time":"August 18, 2018   | Last updated 1 minute ago  ","content":"Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowAl Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in the Red Sea, right before the eyes of the entire world, is a matter of concern.”It absolves the world of responsibility and gives Al Assad a veneer of legitimacy besides liberating Russia and Iran from culpabilityIn the past five years, Syria has become many things: A refugee crisis, a regional quagmire, a western nightmare, a terrorist haven, a Russian power play and the core of Iran’s ambitions. To the international community, however, it’s a civil war. The United Nations, western governments, media and European Union all refer to the Syrian conflict this way. In December 2015, United States Secretary of State John Kerry emphasised the need to “end the nation’s civil war”. In September this year, the New York Times published a long explainer on the conflict, answering, among other questions, ‘What is the Syrian civil war?’These simplifications are inaccurate and dangerous. They absolve the international community of responsibility and give Syrian President Bashar Al Assad a veneer of legitimacy. They liberate Russia and Iran — actively involved with troops in the conflict — from culpability. And they allow internal terrorist groups to justify their involvement and violence.There is no doubt that civil war is one of the many layers of the Syrian conflict. Local factions are fighting each other. In truth though, this is a war on the people of Syria, carried out by the Al Assad regime and his allies.We see that in the violence. According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, Al Assad’s forces have killed 95 per cent of Syrian victims. Additionally, Al Assad controls the army, including tanks, planes and barrel bombs. He has shelled areas that witnessed peaceful protests. He has used chemical weapons against his own people. He controls the intelligence, security and military apparatus that have diligently and systematically worked since 2011 to arrest, torture and kill all nonviolent activists.Al Assad also released dangerous extremist inmates from prison and allowed them to organise and build armed groups. He did this not by accident, but as part of a strategy to create a civil war and radicalise what remained of the revolution. His strategy has been to shift the narrative from reform to sectarianism by emphasising terrorism, thereby presenting himself as a partner in the global war on terror.It’s also hard to square the civil war claim with the vast amount of external interference. Faced with a strong resistance from the armed opposition groups, Al Assad has allowed both Iran and Russia to help him and his regime survive. In fact, Al Assad’s army is barely fighting today. The fighting force on the ground is mostly Shiite militias, with some Syrian Arab Army battalions — all reporting to Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and aided by Russian air bombing. Without Iran and Russia, Al Assad would have been long gone.How can we call this conflict a civil war when the Syrian opposition is rarely fighting Syrian loyalists and instead battling with foreign fighters in its own country? Is it a civil war when all of Russia, Iran, the United States and other assorted Nato nations are involved in one way or another?Calling it a civil war has serious implications on policy. It protects Al Assad. He may be an obnoxious dictator, the logic goes, but a stabilising one. It also gives the impression that this is an internal conflict, allowing western powers and international organisations not to take sides. As a result of this inaction, the world witnessed the exodus of Syrian refugees, the scuttling of US efforts by Russia and Iran and terrorist attacks in European cities.Equating the killer with the victim has a moral challenge that eventually legitimises the regime’s crimes against humanity. It also subdues the modern history of Syria that brought Hafeez Al Assad to power where the Baath Party and eventually the ruling family refused to allow anyone else in Syria to participate in politics. This regime has always resorted to military solutions and has never chosen negotiations over violence. Today, with Iran commanding the battles in Syria and Russia negotiating with the international community on the future of Syria, what is left of the regime is an image that is only needed to preserve other states’ interests.This is not a civil war. Only when we stop calling it a civil war, we might be able to understand the history and strategy of the regime, the various layers of the Syrian people, the interests of those who are already intervening and the significance of accountability.— Washington PostHanin Ghaddar is the inaugural Friedmann Visiting Fellow at The Washington Institute.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedWhy true journalism will never dieWhy North Korean nukes are still on the tableKerala braces for more heavy showersUS threatens more sanctions on TurkeyFor balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Al Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in ...Trump’s admission that he has taken occupied Jerusalem ...Holiday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Like the events in Libya the bloody confrontation in Syria may develop into a full blown civil war. But unlike Libya, a civil war in Syria fuelled by ethnic conflicts carries with it the distinct possibility of igniting other ethnic conflicts and further destabilising the region.While the revolution in Libya may not have been characterised as a vital interest of the US, the events in Syria clearly can affect Washington’s vital interests in the region.The overriding interest here would be to prevent local conflicts from threatening the traditional American vital interests in the Middle East, namely: Access to strategic resources in the region and the maintenance of a regional military balance of power that is favourable to Israel.It was to defend these interests that Washington went to war against Iraq —twice. Once in 1991 to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait; and again in 2003 to forcibly remove Saddam Hussain from power and end his threats to the Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, on the one hand, and to Israel’s military hegemony in the region, on the other hand. Ironically the neo-cons in the Bush administration, pursuing common goals with Israel, had targeted the Syrian regime as next Arab candidate for regime change, to put an end, once and for all, to all possible Arab challenges to Israeli military domination in the region.Although as a military power Libya pales into insignificance with Nato’s military might, it took Nato months and thousands of air strikes to subdue Libyan military defence, and pave the way for Libyan opposition to take power.But Syria is not Libya, and even on grounds of humanitarian intervention, it would be hard for Washington to find support domestically and internationally for a Libya — like the bombing campaign against Syria. The most logical reason for opposing such a war against Syria is the difficulty of keeping it localised. Another imponderable would be the reaction of Israel and the temptation to grab more land from Syria.One more reason why the military option against Syria is not viable is the absence of any clear leadership for the pro-democracy movement, or for the opposition.Whatever opposition there is remains rhetorically committed to change but effectively unable to bring it about. In Syria, the question is not whether the opposition is armed or not, the question is: Who are the opposition? And how effective are they as a political force? And are they capable of popular mobilisation to support a programme of democratic reforms and economic revival?It was not until last week that the fragmented Syrian opposition managed to establish a broad-based national council committed to overthrowing President Bashar Al Assad’s government.Obama too wants to overthrow Al Assad’s regime. The question is how? The New York Times reported last month that the Obama administration had decided that the Al Assad regime would not survive the sustained challenge of the protest movement. The administration, the paper reported, had begun to prepare for the post-Al Assad regime.In particular, Washington is concerned about the possibility of a civil war among Syria’s ethnic and religious groups (Alawite, Druze, Christian and Sunni sects) and its potential impact on the region.But Washington may be repeating the mistakes of its unfortunate experience in Iraq. In its obsession with regime change and the forcible removal of Saddam, it failed to develop adequate strategies to prevent the post-Saddam Iraq from descending into violent chaos.What is already clear is that Washington has decided that Al Assad must go. But it is not clear what plans there are, if any, for the post-Al Assad Syria.Obama has called on him to step down and the US is currently discussing “how to help bring it about.”In other words, the Obama administration is currently discussing how to bring about regime change in Syria in the absence of an open military intervention. Washington has opted for a strategy of punitive economic pressure on the Al Assad regime.Shutting the European market to which Syria exports 90 per cent of its oil exports, could cripple the Syrian economy. But it may not necessarily bring the regime down. Those Syrians already suffering from high unemployment and chronic poverty are already in revolt. The business elites and the middle class were supportive of Al Assad’s liberalisation of the economy, and his capacity to think strategically as evidence by his support for the American war on terror.After the armed uprisings of the Muslim Brothers in Aleppo in 1980 and in Hama in February 1982 were crushed with ruthless brutality, a government general amnesty diffused the threat and fragmented the organisation. The army is infiltrated with Alawite and is a beneficiary of the status quo, although this could change.The irony is that a new political party law ratified by the Syrian parliament last August could have effectively put an end to the one-party system put in place by the Baathists after they seized power in a military coup in 1963. But it did not, proving that an authoritarian regime cannot reform itself.Adel Safty is Distinguished Professor Adjunct at the Siberian Academy of Public Administration, Russia.

No matter how harsh it might sound to western and Arab ears, it has become evident that thanks to Russian support, Al Assad may continue his rule from Damascus. The dictator was able to avoid a total collapse of his regime due to a combination of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s help, the Syria’s national army’s role and the Iranian-funded Hezbollah’s backing. In the meantime, Al Assad has been able to recover most of the lost territories that he now keeps under a tight control. Thanks to the western stubbornness, the United States-funded ‘Syrian rebel’ force has eventually been reduced to nothing. It will now be part of the political delegations attending meetings in Astana or Geneva, and progressively rallying individuals — or migrants. Opposition leader Michel Kilo can go on spending good time in his Doha house and Syrian ‘intellectuals’ may resume their endless debates out of regional five-star palaces or Paris’ cafe terraces.The immeasurable muck-up of the war in Syria is startling. It started with an absurd concept according to which, a dictatorial regime would voluntarily give up all the levels of command that it firmly held, simply because it was required to so by ‘democratic’ nations. Then, a concentration of ill-inspired decisions transformed the country into a regional battlefield, where every actor was sponsoring some group. The results are there for all to see: Nearly 500,000 casualties, millions of displaced people and migrants, a ruined economy, a sacrificed generation — while Al Assad continues to rule! Let’s hope some of the world leaders will feel uncomfortable in their conscience regarding what they did — or let others do — in Syria.There was a scramble to get rid of a dictatorship, but what should have been the approach is a genuine revolution, which implies a huge majority of the population hitting the streets and taking up arms — which did not apparently happen in Syria. One ought to understand the similarities as well as the differences between a foreign war that overthrows the existing legal authority — no need to remind ourselves that the Iraq war didn’t achieve anything significant; a ‘palace revolution’ — which fundamentally doesn’t change anything; or the so-called ‘belly-dancing’ strategy, whereby there is an open policy towards the external world, until the ‘beast’ realises it is no more in command — that is what took place in some former Soviet republics during the ‘orange’ revolutions, and what was actually unfolding in Syria until 2011. Unfortunately, everything will now have to start from a scratch. Seven years have been lost and a whole population deeply wounded.On the European side, French diplomacy proved devastating. To start with, both the assertions were wrong: That the “Muslim Brotherhood are nice guys to work with because they are the representatives of a moderate Islam”, and that “There is no chance to begin discussions with the Syrian regime until Al Assad is gone”. Seven years later, Al Assad is still there and it is amply clear that the Muslim Brotherhood are not “nice guys”.How will the regional balance of power be affected by this emerging situation?Assuming that most of the rebel forces are on the verge of disappearance — “The Syrian Opposition should now look for a logical attitude”, one of their regional financial sponsors recently declared as a confirmation. Yet, a residual resistance pocket remains in Idlib, with Al Nusrah leading the show. Actually, both US and Russia can use that as an excellent pretext to stay on-site — and on top. It is another hurdle towards the creation of an independent Kurdish territory, Turkey’s permanent nightmare.Elsewhere in Syria, the ‘non-fighting’ war zones promoted by Russia and accepted by Turkey and the US will develop, while talks in Astana or Geneva will go on — until there is nobody to attend them! As for the Al Assad regime, it will intensify its all-round opening campaign, as already confirmed by Syrian opponents who are being increasingly courted these days. The launch of reconstruction work will be another consolidating element, despite attempts to correlate the matter with the sought-after ‘political transition’. The presence of former Syrian planning minister Abdullah Al Dardari as the head of the United Nations Reconstruction Programme for Syria will surely help.As for foreign actors, Turkey will remain concentrated on Kurdistan; the US and Russia, on sharing their influence, fighting terrorism and doing business; Europe — and especially France — will be trying to be back into the peace process. This move has finally been initiated by French President Emmanuel Macron, while the other neighbouring countries will probably be concentrating on more vital domestic issues. Al Assad will then be in a position to reinstate a favourite Syrian game — making Russia and Iran oppose each other, so that he gets more breathing space.In the end, we will still be left with the question that the Syrian people and their children are so rightfully entitled to ask: “Why did we have to come to such a pass?”Luc Debieuvre is a French essayist and a lecturer at Iris (Institut de Relations Internationales et Strategiques) and the ‘Faco’ Law University of Paris.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedWhy true journalism will never dieWhy North Korean nukes are still on the tableKerala braces for more heavy showersUS threatens more sanctions on TurkeyFor balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Al Houthis, threatening international maritime navigation in ...Trump’s admission that he has taken occupied Jerusalem ...Holiday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Marwa knew it was the call she had longed for through three long years of silence, but when a young man’s voice faltered down the line, she was no longer sure of what she wanted to hear.She felt the heat on her skin as the sunlight of early spring pierced the lace curtains.The uprising back home in Syria had put her family on a collision course with tragedy from day one. Marwa had not chosen her husband’s sacrifices, but her life had been overtaken by them. She was tired, lonely, sometimes angry. She wanted a sign that he still remembered, that he was sorry for how he’d left her. She wanted him back. Theirs was a love story. She was the bold one, 18 years old and happy to be done with school. Omar was older and more solemn, but his smile was infectious. “It crossed his face so fast that you couldn’t help smiling, too,” Marwa remembered.She had pretended to ignore his glances on the spring day in 2006 when she visited his electronic appliances store in central Damascus. The family had been paying for their refrigerator in instalments, but since it was usually Marwa’s father who stopped by the store, Omar had not been expecting a visit from the young woman who smiled softly as she browsed his shelves without looking up. “I knew he was looking at me,” she said. “He was studying every detail.”When Omar plucked up the courage to suggest he pick up payments from the family home, Marwa felt a jolt of excitement in her stomach. She knew her father had no idea what was going on, and when she tiptoed into the living room to serve the men Arabic coffee, her brown eyes met Omar’s for a brief moment.Soon she was calling the store every day, just to hear his voice. “I’d slam the phone down as soon as he picked up in case he realised it was me. But he always knew,” she said. “We fell in love in 15 days.”They married soon after, and when Marwa became pregnant with their first son, Omar’s family pitched in to buy them a place in the gray-brick suburb of Daraya. It was barely more than a bedroom, but they were happy in their little refuge high above the traffic and far from the prying eyes of the plainclothes police officers on their street.Outside, the world was changing. Anti-regime protests had spread from Tunisia to Egypt and Libya, and by March 2011, it was Syria’s turn. At times, residents said, it felt as if the whole of Daraya was in the streets, holding flowers aloft and roaring in unison, their chants echoing amid the concrete and the dust.Omar was intoxicated, spending hours on social media as he chatted away and dreamed bigger by the day, Marwa recalled. Demonstrations were rippling through the country, and the protests in Daraya, which they considered the cradle of the revolution, felt electric. Each night he would join the crowds as they marched through the town bellowing “Leave, Bashar!” and “The men of Syria are not afraid!”Marwa could not share her husband’s dreams. It all felt too fast, too foolish, and President Bashar Al Assad looked in no mood to compromise. Whenever Omar was getting ready to join the crowds, she would beg him not to go and then wait up for his return. She had listened with growing trepidation as Omar and his father argued late into the night, the elder man telling his son that they were playing with fire. The protesters had no plan, no direction. The regime had killed opposition members in the tens of thousands after a rebellion three decades earlier. “This time it will be worse,” he told Omar.The couple would sometimes be mid-conversation when Omar’s cellphone pinged with messages from friends wanting to talk planning and revolution, she recounted. He nearly always went to them, leaving Marwa alone with their son.By fall, there were tanks outside the town and guns in the crowds. The following September, Al Assad loyalists killed openly in the streets of Daraya as the army pummelled civilian homes with bombs and mortar rounds. Marwa’s anxieties had melted into pure fear, but Omar still wouldn’t leave. His friends were now wanted by the regime, and he said he couldn’t live with himself if he fled. He found a way to smuggle Marwa away, past army lines and checkpoints and into Damascus.Within days, she learned that she was pregnant again.Omar was in hiding. Friends told her that police were searching door-to-door. When they finally spoke, his voice, usually so calm and strong, sounded thin with fear.“He didn’t know how we could have a baby at a time like this,” she said. “He was scared, but he told me he loved me.” Next-door Lebanon was the safest place for her now, they agreed, but as Marwa’s car pulled out onto the Damascus-Beirut highway one afternoon in early November, she did not foresee a long absence.The regime’s far-reaching crackdown could not avert Syria’s descent into civil war. As more and more people were rounded up, armed opposition groups seemed to multiply by the day.By the time Marwa returned to Damascus for a brief trip to see Omar the following month, the capital already felt different. Conversations were more clipped, and everyone seemed wary. She was window-shopping for baby clothes, she recalled, when a group of men approached Omar in the street. They were wearing civilian clothes, but Marwa didn’t like the way Omar’s whole body seemed to stiffen as the oldest man addressed him. She was at his side in seconds, and his expression read like a silent plea. “It was like he was telling me to walk away and not tell them I was his wife. They took us both.”In State Security’s Branch 40, a drab building near a red-roofed Italian hospital, Marwa watched her husband stripped to his underwear and pushed into a battered chair. Questions came thick and fast. They said the protesters were terrorists. What was Omar doing with them? Was he a terrorist? Were his friends terrorists? When the interrogator brought out his tools, Marwa tried to turn away. A guard grabbed her cheeks and forced her head back to face her husband as the men got to work.She remembers only flashes. Omar screaming as they beat his head and stomach with an iron bar. Blood everywhere, but Omar telling them nothing. Her mouth so dry she could barely swallow. Then an officer stepped forward and placed a small, cold knife to her pregnant belly. Omar’s swollen face froze.“He told them everything. He gave up his friends’ names,” Marwa said. “Then they pulled him from the room and asked me to leave.” The interrogation was over.She kept her head down as she walked away down a long corridor, pretending not to see the prisoners lining each side with faces to the wall. Close to the entrance, she thought one of them was Omar, his flesh red and raw from the beating. But the man escorting her told her to keep her eyes straight ahead. “You need to forget where you were and what you saw,” he said. “Keep walking.”The heavens opened as Marwa walked, and she trudged and stumbled through the icy rain. When night fell, she had lost count of the hours. She was crying uncontrollably. In her pants pocket, the weight of Omar’s wallet, empty aside from his identification card, pushed against her body. A soldier trailed her home in his car until he got bored, leering from behind the wheel as he offered to take her home.Back at her aunt’s house, she barely had the strength to speak. Again, she could later recall only flashes. The family fussing, her body so cold and weak. Samer, her son, was shouting. “Why did you and Baba leave me? I waited for you, why did you leave me?”Marwa gave birth to her second son, Yousuf, in Lebanon. She had refused to leave the house when the first contractions began, inconsolable at the thought of giving birth without Omar. But time dulled her fear, and as the curly-haired newborn grew, she learned day by day what it meant to live as a refugee and a single parent, one of hundreds of thousands scattered by the conflict, not knowing whether jailed loved ones had survived.Her small house perched on the edge of a town in the rolling Bekaa Valley was full of people. Relatives came in and out, helping with the children and watching as Yousuf grew milk teeth and Samer went to school and adjusted to life in a strange country. Nothing filled the void.Samer, now 6 years old, rejected any suggestion that his father was not coming back, even though he could barely recall his likeness outside of the images she showed him on her cellphone. In time, Yousuf would do the same.Marwa remembered everything. The day Omar posed for her camera in 2011, grinning as he held the uprising’s green-white-and-black flag aloft. How his body would visibly relax in their home when he returned from a long day. There had also been long nights lost in conversation, with Omar’s laugh, when it came, sounding so deep that it seemed to come right from his belly.The uprising felt like a bad dream. “What did their ‘freedom’ bring me?” she asked herself. The protests had scared her, but she had agreed with their goals of achieving a future without fear. Now she would trade them all for one more day with him.She wondered what he would find if that did happen. The years had changed her. “I’m not me anymore. I’m not the same girl,” she thought. But she also feared that she had not changed fast enough and couldn’t give her sons what they needed. The first time Samer was beaten up at school for being an outsider, she told him to keep out of trouble. They were guests in Lebanon and they had to be careful.In moments of introspection, Marwa could not believe that Omar would have survived. To live through the cruelty she had witnessed would be a miracle.When a Syrian military defector smuggled photographs out of Syria showing broken bodies from a nearby prison, she scrutinised the images. One of them looked like Omar, she thought. He must be dead.She would never learn otherwise.Inside State Security’s Al Khattib branch, one of the most notorious in downtown Damascus, Omar was packed in a 4-by-5-yard cell with dozens of other prisoners. Across the country, tens of thousands of people had disappeared along an archipelago of torture centres. Months after Omar was imprisoned, he was joined in the cell by a man of Marwa’s age, Mohammad, who had also seen the protests as a dawning of fresh hope.The newcomer was taken aback when he first met his neighbour. Omar had been terribly tortured, Mohammad later recalled. In photographs later shared by his family, Omar is barrel-chested with arms big enough to envelop Marwa and Samer. When Mohammad met him, his collarbone ridged out of his skin.The men spoke every night to ward off boredom and despair. False confessions made repeatedly under torture filled them both with shame. When guards appeared weekly to summon certain cellmates, never to return, the pair began to believe rumours that executions were accelerating.Cellmates who clung too tightly to the memories of people they had loved outside the prison walls were driven mad, Mohammad said. “I forced myself to forget everyone I could. But Omar refused.”On some nights, Omar spoke only of the happy memories from Daraya and the early days of his marriage. On others, he was racked with guilt. For leaving Marwa behind with a child he had never met, and for the times he had lost his temper with a wife who loved him unconditionally.He didn’t know where she was, but he knew he had left her alone. “He wanted to get back to her to make everything right,” Mohammad said.Eventually the two men were separated. They met one more time, late at night in the prison corridor. When they hugged, Omar was even thinner than Mohammad remembered. Mohammad thought the situation was hopeless, but Omar insisted, “We’ll get out of here.”Omar weighed heavily on his mind after Mohammad was abruptly released from prison, without explanation, in December 2013. The first months of freedom were a blur - 10 days in Damascus, then to Lebanon, Turkey, and across the Mediterranean on a smuggler’s boat - but the vision of his friend remained clear.After reaching the Netherlands, Mohammad said, he searched for his cellmate’s name on Facebook, and when he found the profile of a woman who appeared to be Omar’s mother, he finally composed a message. She replied immediately.Within a week, he had a number for Omar’s wife, and clutching the phone nervously one day around noon, he punched in the number and waited. When a woman picked up, he introduced himself carefully and explained as best he could.On the other end of the line, 3,200km away in Lebanon, there was silence. Marwa’s head was spinning. She knew she was still in her living room, but suddenly her body felt very far away.“I was hanging between the earth and the sky,” she said.Mohammad was telling her about Omar. How the guards used to call him by his prison number and how he had spent every night plotting ways to get back to her.When Mohammad was sure she believed him, he told her he had another message. “He just wants you to forgive him.” Hearing nothing down the line, he continued. “If God grants him the strength to get out of there, he says he will never stop trying to make it up to you.”An even longer pause followed. Then he realised she was crying.-Washington PostMax - 36 °CMin - 17 °CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Ambassador Francois Delattre made clear at a Security Council meeting that the European Union will not participate in rebuilding Syria \"unless a political transition is effectively carried out - with constitutional and electoral processes carried out in a sincere and meaningful way.\"Syria's Assad says rebuilding is 'top priority'The politics of reconstruction in SyriaRussia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, whose country is militarily backing Syrian President Bashar Assad, countered that reconstruction should not be linked to politics and the international community should join the country's recovery effort now.But Western nations are adamant about withholding reconstruction money to maximize pressure for a political transition.Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the National Centre for State Defence Control said last week that Moscow's will use their experience in rebuilding post Second World War,to help rebuild Syria\"In the course of solving vital tasks for the Syrian people to restore the country, it is necessary to use historical experience. Here we can turn to history and the Russian state. I believe that the experience of our motherland in the restoration of the national economy after the Great Patriotic War is unparalleled,\" Mizintsev said. \"The period of restoration of our country, initially estimated at 15 years, was reduced several times. In five years, the country became the world's second most powerful economic power.\"Major powers including the five veto-wielding Security Council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - agreed on a roadmap for a Syrian political transition at a meeting in Geneva on June 30, 2012, about 16 months after the Syrian conflict began.The roadmap starts with the establishment of a transitional governing body vested with full executive powers, includes drafting a new constitution, and ends with elections. Successive U.N. envoys have tried to get the government and opposition to the negotiating table, so far unsuccessfully. The current U.N. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is now working to establish on a committee to draft a new constitution.After seven years of war, the country has suffered catastrophic damage and massive rebuilding is needed. Ground warfare, airstrikes and barrel bombs have left entire cities and infrastructure a landscape of rubble. In some places like Aleppo, the destruction is reminiscent of World War II devastation.Earlier this year, the government estimated reconstruction will cost some $200 billion dollars and last 15 years. But like neighboring Iraq, which also needs massive reconstruction after the war against the Islamic State extremist group, no one is offering much to help fund the process.Russia's Polyansky told the council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria that \"a critical challenge\" to the Assad government's call this month for the return of over 5.6 million refugees \"is the revival of the Syrian national economy - the generation of new jobs.\"\"The country is experiencing an acute shortage of construction materials and heavy equipment for which fuel is necessary,\" he said, and the educational and health systems need to be revived.Polyansky then said: \"It would be wise for all international partners to join assistance in the Syrian recovery effort, to eschew artificial linkages to political momentum.\"More broadly, he called for Syria to be reintegrated into the regional trade and economic system which \"will best advance the objective of overall normalization of relations among states in the Middle East.\"\"And, of course, stabilization will help to advance the U.N.-led political settlement process which is unanimously supported by all members of the Security Council,\" Polyansky said.But France's Delattre said a political transition with a new constitution and credible elections is \"the essential condition for the country's stability, and for our contribution to the financing of reconstruction.\"\"Without that,\" Delattre said, \"nothing can justify having France and the European Union engage in financing reconstruction.\"And he added that without \"a breakthrough\" in the political process, the humanitarian situation will never be fully resolved. Max - 36 °CMin - 17 °CHoliday for UAE private sector announcedUAE public holidays 2018Eid Al Adha on August 21Emirates launches new mega ticket saleKerala flood: Woman gives birth after rescueKerala flood: Airport shut down for 4 daysflydubai crash: Siblings win Dh800,000  'Don’t ever mention Modi in a bulletin'20km buffer in Abu Dhabi scrappedGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77ddd04719c866a1b70949"},"header":"MX No. 2 for conflict? It’s simply not true","time":"\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, August 18, 2018","content":"According to a report published in early May, Mexico has become the second-deadliest conflict zone in the world in 2016.The claim came from a press release for the 2017 edition of the Armed Conflict Survey (ACS) by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank. And a media frenzy followed. The IISS press release stated that the 23,000 deaths in 2016 that it attributes to Mexico’s struggle against organized crime came second to the 50,000 fatalities caused by Syria’s civil war.They said this was higher than those caused by conflicts in the rest of the countries covered by the survey, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and the so-called “Northern Triangle” of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.The claim was shared extensively, including via a retweet by U.S. President Donald Trump. But it drew swift criticism from Mexico’s government, which argued, among other things, that Mexico’s organized crime-related violence is not comparable to armed conflicts in Syria or Iraq.In response, IISS published a blog post outlining why it thinks Mexico is in a state of conflict, including Mexico’s own characterization of criminal groups as an existential threat under the previous government.But I argue that the comparison placing Mexico as the second-deadliest conflict zone is fallacious for two main reasons.First, the comparison did not take into account the vastly different sizes of the countries in the study. Mexico’s population (127 million) is larger than the most recent population figures for Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen combined (114.2 million).All else being equal, it is expected that countries with larger populations will have more fatalities or homicides in absolute terms. For example, there where almost twice as many homicides in the U.S. (12,000) as there were fatalities in Yemen (7,000), but this is because the U.S. has a population that is 12 times bigger than Yemen’s, not because it is deadlier than Yemen.To account for different population sizes in cross-national comparisons, mortality and homicide figures are usually expressed as incidents per 100,000 people. This captures the probability that individuals in a given country face of being killed, and so are a better measure than absolute figures.As seen in the graph below, once population sizes are taken into account, the probability of being killed in Mexico was much lower than in the rest of the countries in the ACS top five or in the Northern Triangle.Second, the figures being compared are not measuring the same phenomenon. In the report, fatalities in Mexico and Central America refer to the total number of intentional homicides, while in the rest of the countries in the study they refer to deaths directly caused by armed conflicts.It is true that intentional homicides are sometimes used as a proxy measurement of organized crime activity in Mexico – something I am exploring in my ongoing research. However, that does not mean that it is appropriate to uncritically compare the absolute number of homicides in Mexico to conflict-related fatalities in other countries.That would suggest that all intentional homicides in Mexico – high as they may be – can be attributed to organized crime violence, which is far from the case.Previous editions of the ACS in 2015 and 2016 also included Mexico and reported similarly high levels of fatalities. But the level of coverage of the 2017 report reflects a vastly different global public agenda.Today, with Mexico-U.S. relations at a new low, a looming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the promise of a new physical wall between the two countries, it is not surprising that IISS’s press statement landed front and center in the international news media – even if such comparisons are not the main focus of the ACS.Journalists undeniably “have to get better at reporting science.” But academics and those involved in research – especially in controversial issues such as crime and security – also need to exercise care when publicizing their findings.There is a tension between the efforts to publicize research by highlighting headline-grabbing findings, and the risk of having such findings overhyped and misrepresented, or even spun into a deliberate political agenda, as the right-wing Breitbart News did with the IISS announcement.Academics and think tanks may not have much control over how their findings are reported by the media once they are released to the public. So it is imperative to take extra care when communicating them to the press, and setting out clearly what are the limitations of the findings, as well as the generalizations that can accurately be drawn from them.Patricio R.

Support is coming from private donations, scholarships from the universities and private citizens who will provide accommodation in their homes.Meanwhile, a petition that was launched two weeks ago calling on the federal government to admit 10,000 refugees has garnered the support of 169,000 people.A United Nations representative in Syria said this week that one million Syrian citizens have been displaced by the conflict so far this year, and estimated that another million would follow before the year is out if there is no end to the hostilities.The United States announced this week it would accept 10,000 refugees over the next 12 months.Source: El Debate (sp), Sin Embargo (sp)765sharesMexico’s next president will be Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor and outspoken critic of the political  FULL STORYMexico’s Congress made a bold proposal to the executive branch: suspend cooperation with the U.S. on migration, counter-terrorism and the fight against organized crime.Mexican and US authorities have announced new security strategies including a joint investigative team to target cartel leaders and finances.Two human traffickers were arrested yesterday in Nuevo León when police found 161 Central American migrants crammed into a semi-trailer.With the annual grape harvest season in full swing, this might be a good time to enjoy a glass or two of Mexican wine.Artisans from a small indigenous community in Oaxaca complain that a British clothing retailer is selling imitations of their designs.30sharesMaking love without paying extortion is the theme of a new municipal law in Guadalajara that means public displays of affection,  FULL STORYA children’s advocacy organization has criticized Mexican authorities for separating migrant children older than 12 from their families.Attractive female models often employed at events to greet guests or simply to act as eye candy will not be allowed at government events in Mexico City.Walmart is expanding its presence in retail fuel sales: it began selling propane last month in some stores and is now getting ready to sell automotive fuel.The blush of youth, coupled with a significant surge of hormones, eclipsed whatever little judgment they may have possessed on that fateful night.Ciudad Juárez’s 2017 suicide rate of 8.9 per 100,000 was nearly twice what it was in 2010.

Durango Governor José Rosas Aispuro said they are in a serious but stable condition.Yaquelín Flores, a Mexican national who lives in Colombia and was traveling with her daughter, told reporters yesterday that it had been raining heavily prior to takeoff.“The plane accelerated to take off and it got off the ground but we went into a very strong storm and it fell. Then we hit [the ground and] the plane slid forward. I remembered the protocol of putting my chest over my knees and my daughter did as well,” she said.Flores said fire broke out immediately after the plane came to a stop. She turned around and saw a hole in the fuselage near one of the wings.“We undid our seatbelts and I told my daughter that we had to go out there and we jumped. There were children leaving the plane and crying . . . We managed to get out through the hole but there were flames. I was afraid of being burned but we jumped without thinking or taking anything with us,” she said.“I feel blessed and grateful to God.”Another passenger who was traveling in first class said after the plane hit the ground it slid for a long distance before coming to a halt.He said that he and other passengers in first class were able to leave the aircraft quickly but others took longer, adding that three or four minutes after the plane hit the ground it began to “explode.”Another woman on board assured reporters that the plane had taken off and was briefly airborne before crashing.“Yes, we took off but there was a lot of rain,” she said, adding that she believed the pilot had tried to slow down the plane after it made impact with the ground.Inside the cabin, she said, “it was chaos because people were in shock and didn’t know what to do.” Luggage was strewn across the aisle, making it even more difficult to exit as the cabin was engulfed in flames and filled with smoke.Ramin Parsa told the BBC that “shortly after the plane took off, I knew something was wrong.”He said the plane hit the ground and “started bouncing, shaking and sliding” before hitting trees and coming to a stop in a ditch.“All the lights went off and then there was smoke inside the cabin, people were panicking and screaming,” Parsa said, adding it was “a miracle of God we survived.”Rómulo Campuzano, a National Action Party (PAN) politician, said he had been “very lucky because I was able to get out by the main door” using a torn-off door as a ramp to safety.“I walked away from the plane, turning around to see if the other passengers were getting out, too. It started raining very hard and I think that helped put out the flames,” he said.Some other passengers claimed the plane had been hit by lightning.Once outside the aircraft, passengers walked to the perimeter of the airport to seek medical assistance and local media reported that wire cutters were used to cut a mesh fence to allow them to get out.Flores said paramedics took about 20 minutes to arrive and explained that she lost all her personal belongings including her passport in the crash.Source: Reforma (sp), Milenio (sp), El Universal (sp), BBC (en)A 19-year-old student died this morning after suffering injuries at what is believed to have been a hazing at a rural teacher training college.Eleven people are still in hospital after the crash of Aeroméxico flight 2431, which is now the subject of a negligence suit in a US court.Two jornaleros, or day laborers, three elderly people and one migrant have died due to heat-related illnesses in the state.Some windy and wet weather is forecast for parts of six states due to a tropical storm and a hurricane but neither is forecast to make landfall.With the annual grape harvest season in full swing, this might be a good time to enjoy a glass or two of Mexican wine.Artisans from a small indigenous community in Oaxaca complain that a British clothing retailer is selling imitations of their designs.30sharesMaking love without paying extortion is the theme of a new municipal law in Guadalajara that means public displays of affection,  FULL STORYA children’s advocacy organization has criticized Mexican authorities for separating migrant children older than 12 from their families.Attractive female models often employed at events to greet guests or simply to act as eye candy will not be allowed at government events in Mexico City.Walmart is expanding its presence in retail fuel sales: it began selling propane last month in some stores and is now getting ready to sell automotive fuel.The blush of youth, coupled with a significant surge of hormones, eclipsed whatever little judgment they may have possessed on that fateful night.Ciudad Juárez’s 2017 suicide rate of 8.9 per 100,000 was nearly twice what it was in 2010.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77de0b4719c866a1b70951"},"header":"Rhetoric has changed; menace now Muslims","time":"\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, August 18, 2018","content":"I’m always the first to admit when I’m wrong. Well, perhaps the second. Or third. Whatever. In my November 24 op-ed for Mexico News Daily, entitled “Pew bombshell won’t change the rhetoric,” I botched it big-time.In that piece I described how the Right’s – and in particular Donald Trump’s – bigoted rhetoric against Mexican immigrants would not change despite the latest Pew research indicating the U.S. is experiencing a net loss of Mexican immigrants.My reasons were essentially twofold, and based both on the hard and social sciences. First, through the process of evolution by natural selection, we have been hard-wired to exhibit xenophobia and tribalism, to be naturally suspicious of groups different from us (such as Mexicans), and to blame others for our self-made problems.Second, fear sells. As I’ve said before, you can’t keep it on the shelves. In this case, the fear of the brown-skinned “others” who may be taking our jobs, raping our women and introducing our children to drugs. You know – the Ann Coulter-type racist polemic.Well, when I said the rhetoric wouldn’t change, I was wrong. It has more than changed, it has completely disappeared.After the Islamist Paris and San Bernardino attacks, the GOP found another, even more threatening menace to the Norman Rockwell American way of life: Muslims! It seems that Mexicans are off the hook (for now). Instead of selling the fears of job losses and social degradations at the hands of America’s great unwashed Mexican migrants, we’ve stumbled upon a new fall guy to distract our attention from our self-caused endemic problems.Namely, Muslims who want to impose sharia law, whose goal is to create a new caliphate in Middle America, who are striving to instill terror on us infidels to the point of forcing our women to wear bags, our men to grow beards and profess allegiance to Allah and his prophet Mohamed.Gone is the Orwellian Trump-speak of building “big beautiful walls” or deporting 11 million undocumented workers along with their American citizen children. No, sir. There’s a much more succulent scapegoat to roast over the spit of ignorance. Now it’s about banning all Muslim entries into the U.S., requiring Muslims to register with government authorities, and turning back all would-be Syrian refugees.But to give credit where credit is due, Trump and his acolytes aren’t just shooting from the hip: within the vade-mecum of the GOP there’s plenty of historic precedent for these policies. For example there’s the return of a thousand asylum-seeking Jews aboard the MS St. Luis in 1939, where a quarter later died in death camps. Or the internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War and the confiscation of their property. The Donald has done his homework!Now, I’ll be first to admit that Islam has a problem. Unlike some of my fellow secular humanists (with whom I’m engaged in perpetual debate over this issue), I’m no fan of the tenets of Islam. It’s a backwards, repressive, too-often violent, Bronze-Age mythology that should be relegated to our prehistory.Luckily, most American Muslims are nominal believers, not unlike Mexican Catholics. It’s more about cultural comfort than the literal belief that the Prophet flew to the heavens on a winged horse or that a cracker literally turns into the body of Christ.So I won’t go out on a limb again by predicting that the hyper-partisan rhetoric against American Muslims or Syrian asylum seekers is here to stay. Indeed, if the aphorism that history repeats itself holds any truth, then we might expect those dirty Italians or drunken Irish to take their turns on the block of flapdoodle and pestilential public policy ideas once more.Among Trump’s semi-literate hillbilly base, an enemy will always be needed: trying to sell the nuanced discussion of facts to people with only a dozen working synapses is tantamount to trying to sell a sensible Volvo to someone only in the market for a sexy, hopped-up Camaro.If there is a more accurate condemnation of the once drolly and now hectoring preachments of a politically cynical and capricious GOP, I am at a loss to explain what it might be.Until next year, wishing everyone a happy holiday season.Glen Olives Thompson is a professor of North American Law at La Salle University in Chihuahua, a specialist in law and public policy and a regular contributor to Mexico News Daily.The economy secretary said today that the three NAFTA partners need to show flexibility to reach an updated trade agreement.Trade talks between Mexico and the US will continue next week as new sticking points have surfaced over tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles.Mexico has publicly accepted for the first time the US proposal to include set minimum wages for the automotive industry as part of a new agreement.Violence in Mexico is largely fueled by the illegal entry of weapons from the United States, says Interior Secretary Alfonso Navarrete Prida.With the annual grape harvest season in full swing, this might be a good time to enjoy a glass or two of Mexican wine.Artisans from a small indigenous community in Oaxaca complain that a British clothing retailer is selling imitations of their designs.30sharesMaking love without paying extortion is the theme of a new municipal law in Guadalajara that means public displays of affection,  FULL STORYA children’s advocacy organization has criticized Mexican authorities for separating migrant children older than 12 from their families.Attractive female models often employed at events to greet guests or simply to act as eye candy will not be allowed at government events in Mexico City.Walmart is expanding its presence in retail fuel sales: it began selling propane last month in some stores and is now getting ready to sell automotive fuel.The blush of youth, coupled with a significant surge of hormones, eclipsed whatever little judgment they may have possessed on that fateful night.Ciudad Juárez’s 2017 suicide rate of 8.9 per 100,000 was nearly twice what it was in 2010.

Among those killed was Mora’s son, Manuel.The two leaders, who are also former civil defense group founders, have been rivals for some time, and their enmity came to a head in December. Those involved in the shooting turned themselves in after being asked to do so by the state’s then-security commissioner, Alfredo Castillo.But this week a judge ruled that Mora and his followers should be set free after it could not be established who fired first, and that the shooters were acting in self-defense. Another argument was that both sides enjoyed legitimacy as being part of the Fuerza Rural, a community police force.Mora was the first to be released. Upon leaving the Mil Cumbres prison last night he said he was going to dedicate himself to his farm and “continue fighting as best I can for my people in La Ruana, through the Fuerza Rural, and perhaps in politics.”Mora, who has previously indicated interest in running for political office, confirmed he is meeting today with Dante Delgado, leader of the Citizens’ Movement party. However, he had nothing good to say about politicians. In general, he said, they are no more than thieves.Nor did he have anything nice to say about his enemy, José Antonio Torres. During a television interview he said he would never forgive him, holding him fully responsible for the December shooting. Mora said authorities were making a mistake in letting Torres go.The lime farmer’s stint in jail wasn’t the first. He was arrested last year after two of Torres’ men were killed.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b77de2a4719c866a1b70955"},"header":"Some reflections after the papal visit to MX","time":"\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, August 18, 2018","content":"I wanted to write about the papal visit to Mexico a couple of weeks ago. But I couldn’t. Truth be told, I was suffering from a bit of pope fatigue.But now that he’s gone back to the Vatican, I can listen to my favorite classic rock station uninterrupted by papal proclamations. The ubiquitous, Chinese-made, pope-themed T-shirts are already wearing out in this unseasonably warm February in Chihuahua and will soon be consigned to rags for polishing furniture.El Papa looked disturbingly healthy, which means there’s undoubtedly a return visit in the works. In the meantime, I intend to enjoy my reprieve from my kids’ questions, such as, “Does the pope fart?” And, “Why does he wear a dress?”I’m not generally a fan of popes or imams or evangelical preachers or New Age spiritualists or anyone else who claims special knowledge that the rest of us aren’t privy to and cannot hope to understand without special help. Not that all of these people are necessarily frauds or charlatans – though many surely are – it’s just that no matter how hard I try I just can’t bring myself to buy what they’re selling.Perhaps it’s because I’ve never been desperately in want of security, love, or comfort, or perhaps I’m overly infatuated with the sciences. I couldn’t say that if I were unlucky enough through the happenstance of birth to be hopelessly poor in a violent society I wouldn’t be prone to the seductions of the supernatural, or that had I been raised in a piously religious family I wouldn’t perhaps cling to its vacuous certainties.Even when dry-heaving from air sickness before jumping out of perfectly good airplanes as a U.S. Army soldier, I never prayed to a higher power. (As an Army buck private I distinctly remember my bemusement at seeing an ashen-faced, square-jawed Marine captain crossing himself before we abandoned gravity on our required night jump from a C-130 over the pine forests of Georgia.)It could be I’m just wired differently. And of course it could be something else I’m entirely unaware of.When Pope Francis visited Mexico his prescient counsel left a wake of hope and general agreement behind it. But the wake of that papal ship on white-capped sea of brusque intolerance, greed and tribalism hasn’t lasted long.It’s not that I’m a pessimist, but rather just a student of history, and as Hegel said (always one to state the obvious), we learn from history that we do not learn from history.Francis’ humanist message of tolerance and love, his deep suspicion of greed and consumerism, his advocacy for the protection of the environment, his fomenting of the idea that all of our species should be entitled to at least minimally dignified existences, came across well. Heads nodded in agreement.And it sounded all-too familiar. Pope John Paul II said many of the same things on his Mexican papal visit in 1979 (followed by four more trips to Mexico in subsequent decades). But nothing much came of John Paul’s visits, and nothing will come of Francis’.Political corruption will continue (the irony of a church railing against corruption when in the not-too-distant past religious patronage and the open selling of church favors was not considered in the least bit corrupt). Wealth will continue to concentrate, as Oxfam and Thomas Piketty have consistently predicted, in both the U.S. and Mexico.And poor Mexicans will be treated as second-class citizens within their own country, and as sub-humans within the United States, consigned to live in a dystopia where property rights rank decidedly higher than the rights of humans.But something important has changed. John Paul II was revered by conservative American politicians. Only leftist radicals and Sinead O’Conner would dare speak ill of him. But the American political landscape is very different now – it is more principled (in a bad way) and less pragmatic.At the very height of irony, it is now the secular humanists on the Left who find themselves praising the moral landscape envisioned by Francis, while GOP politicians either hold him in open contempt, or avoid talking about him. (As to the latter, that can only last until the general election gets under way, which I await with breath baited by a communion wafer.)Like the American body politic, the Catholic Church has changed as well. Indeed, it has undergone an uncodified reformation under the leadership of Pope Francis. And this reformation is deliciously radical for one reason in particular: it exemplifies traditional Christian values. Not the “I’m right and you’re wrong because my dogma says so,” values, but rather the values of love thy neighbor as thyself, turn the other cheek, eschew greed, and protect the Earth.Precisely the values that the American Religious Right hate. Their values are drawn from the Bronze Age Pentateuch: hate thy neighbor, give no thought for tomorrow, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, get as much as you can while you can, god gave us the Earth to exploit as we wish, and slavery is not such a bad thing – indeed, the trafficking of humans is just good business.The pope’s “new” Christian values have a particular secular humanist flavor to them. Which is undoubtedly the reason the American Right has turned against Pope Francis with such spittle-flecked vitriol.On that last sunny Wednesday in Ciudad Juárez, the pope visited a prison and told the inmates to “work so that this society which uses people and discards them will not go on claiming victims.” He then celebrated mass at a dusty fairgrounds overlooking the Rio Bravo, praying for the migrant dead.(Since 1994, over 7,000 desiccated human remains have been found in the Arizona desert, but who’s really counting?)Later, he obliquely criticized Donald Trump, saying, “a person who only thinks about building walls . . . and not building bridges, is not a Christian.” In an in-flight press conference back to the (ironically walled) Vatican, he came dangerously close to condoning artificial birth control in light of the spread of the Zika virus.(Octogenarian virgin Catholic theologians and apologists have been walking back the pope’s comments ever since – parsing, qualifying and befriending the necessary casuistry to say that the pope didn’t say what he said.)Donald Trump, of course, did the gentlemanly thing, and threatened a lawsuit. He also said, “I don’t think [Pope Francis] understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico.”It is almost universally agreed that Trump is a horse’s ass of such epic proportions (even among his supporters) that it would be hard to exaggerate his carnival-barking ugliness. But he isn’t dumb.He must know, assuming he has policy advisers who can read, that Mexican immigrants to the U.S. (legal or otherwise) are a benefit to the U.S. economy, as even some conservative groups have reluctantly admitted, and that the U.S. is experiencing a net loss of illegal immigrants.Moreover, even a cursory look at FBI crime data reveals that illegal immigrants are more law abiding than average U.S. citizens, and not, as it were, drug dealers, rapists and thieves. But empirically verifiable data isn’t very sexy. As sociologist Barry Glassner pointed out in his seminal work The Culture of Fear, the lifeblood of American politics and public media is fear.Frightening people to the very edge of panic is the sin qua non for Republican politics. And the more clear and present the danger, the better: raping Mexicans, dodgy Syrian refugees (watch out for those elderly women with grandchildren – they’re in cahoots with ISIS), and communism 2.0 (i.e. Bernie Sanders), to name but a few scary memes. It doesn’t really matter what you’re afraid of, just choose your favorite flavor – blacks, Mexicans, drugs, atheists, books, ad nauseam.But if this were not enough, we now have the Zika virus. Maine’s pride and joy – Republican Gov. Paul LePage – recently waxed hysterical that immigrants and asylum seekers were bringing with them deadly diseases incubated by the “ziki fly.” Never mind that no such thing exists. Or that the Zika virus is a mild mosquito borne illness only (potentially) dangerous to the fetuses of pregnant women – It’s fucking scary.So expect a new conspiracy theory in the very near future that the Mexican government plans to infect Gringolandia with Zika (or “ziki” if you prefer – it doesn’t much matter) so that all new Gabacho babies will be born with microcephaly. In a generation, all Americans will have heads the size of Florida oranges, and it will be easy to take back the land stolen in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.But I digress. The point I’m trying to make, perhaps too circuitously for my politically conservative readers, friends and colleagues, is this: consider that your fair weather intellectual leaders on the Right have turned toward cannibalizing their traditionally greatest cultural ally – the leader of the Catholic Church and the representative of Christ on our little blue planet. Particularly on the issue of immigration.But curiously, the current pope hasn’t said anything different regarding immigration than Pope John Paul II, or even Pope Pius XII, for that matter.We might forgive Maine’s Forrest Gump-of-a-governor LePage for his idiocy. (After all, his surname sounds suspiciously French, which can only mean he’s a Frenchurian socialist candidate implanted specifically to discredit the Republican Party to ensure the election of a Sanders clone in Maine’s 2018 gubernatorial race.)But then there’s Trump, who is hardly alone in his revulsion of the pope’s preachings on economic equality, climate change, or immigration. Rush Limbaugh expressed his dismay that the pope was not actively campaigning for Bernie Sanders. Jeb! Bush actually defended (!) Donald Trump, saying that it was not appropriate for the pope to question Trump’s Christian faith.Ben Carson, in a brief instance of consciousness, said “enforcing our immigration laws is not in contradiction of love and kindness.” (Strange, coming from a man who has proposed drone strikes at the border, the desert itself apparently not efficient enough in dealing death to children.)Jeb! (I’m not sure if he’s legally changed his name to include an exclamation point) of course has wisely dropped out of the race, testament to the fact that money really can’t buy you love, while Carson stubbornly refuses to throw in the towel, despite polling numbers lower than his pulse rate (but book sales remain brisk).Republicans, of course, have never liked this pope. In 2015, during the pope’s U.S. visit, Chris Christie said, “I just think the pope is wrong.” He went on to pontificate (what a glorious verb) that the pope was only infallible on religious matters and not political ones, as if one could possibly separate the two, especially in America.It has now become a point of pride among GOP politicians to openly disagree with the pontiff. Notably, Rick Santorum, a hyper-devout Catholic to the point of psychosis, echoed Christie’s sentiments, apparently inoculated against the (more dangerous than Zika) virus of philosophical consistency.Rick Perry, despite his new black-framed eyeglasses, and his criticisms of the pope’s radical social views, could never quite recover from his statement that Jesus’ native language was English, or viral photos of his supporters carrying signs reading “Home Scholer’s [sic] for Perry.”So here I am, and here you are, living inside a calliope of the absurd. Mexicans and Americans are more alike than either would like to believe. The fact is, we love our children and hope for better lives for them. We go to work every day with hope for the realization of the distant light of peace, and comfort, and stability.We suffer from asinine laws passed by the self-studied idiots we elect. We too easily discard reason for passion, and live internal fantasy lives where quiet desperation is unknown.Some might be confused by this essay. Do I think that the pope is saying some sensible, moral, and ethical things? You bet. Do I believe in the teaching of the Catholic Church? Not so much. Do I think the current gaggle of GOP candidates has any solutions for the observable and endemic decline of America? Absolutely not.The truth is we are at war. Both Mexico and the United States. With ourselves. All civilizations and all countries experience their Belle Époque, their apogee of success, some more modestly than others. The decade following WWII found America at the very height of its power, economic prosperity, geopolitical influence, and limitless hope in the perfection of an enlightened civilization.The Sumerians, the Greeks, the Romans, and countless others have fallen from their own weight so slowly as to be imperceptible by a single generation. The Greeks thought themselves to be exceptional, as did the Romans, as do Americans now.America’s empire in turn is being slowly diluted and retracted. Rome distracted its citizenry with gladiators. We’re distracted by the modern day equivalent – pudgy men in suits battling and insulting each other with word salads of nonsense, where sloganeering, ridiculous platitudes and religious adherence to failed ideologies have replaced sensible public policy ideas, where pandering to morons and hillbillies is quite possibly the only way to get elected.It is entirely likely that our next president will be elected by World Wrestling Federation fans. Donald Trump’s ridiculous comb-over is just a business mogul’s mullet.Mexico’s fate, because it has chosen (perhaps unwillingly) to be a satellite of its powerful northern neighbor, may be written as well. If there was ever a time for Mexico to decouple itself from America, to write its own policies and forge its own independent future, it is now.There is no shortage of models to emulate (many northern European countries seem to have pretty much nailed the whole “good governance” thing).

A lightning bolt can result when the energy is discharged.Strong explosions were reported at the volcano on Friday morning, and several pyroclastic flows — hot gas and rock — were seen traveling down the western flank, reported Volcano Discovery.The volcano has seen some intense eruptive activity in the past four months, prompting specialists from the University of Colima to fly over it and have a look. But while doing so the mountain gave a demonstration of its force with an explosion in the center of the crater.A gray column of gas and vapor formed and rose above the plane carrying the volcanologists. One of them was Nick Varley of the sciences faculty at the university. “It’s good luck when that happens because it’s interesting to see exactly where in the crater the explosions are originating. It’s very valuable information.”The temperatures in the columns of gas that result can be as high as 300 C.During their flight the scientists discovered that the many recent explosions have destroyed a dome that had formed within the crater, which measures 170-190 meters across and some 30 meters deep.They expect the explosions to continue, with about 15-20 eruptions a day.Eruptions in February produced some spectacular videos and still photos.Source: Televisa (sp)La María is a crater lake in Colima, an enchanting, hidden-away place where you can enjoy a fireworks show of a sort at night.More than 360,000 people live within a 25-kilometer radius of the volcano El Popo.326sharesDon Goyo is having none of the cold wave taking over Mexico: an eruption at the volcano yesterday could be  FULL STORY1sharesEl Popo is angry, according to one report this morning.

The theater is divided into five seating sections with varying prices, and various offerings of food and beverages.At the top end, for a US $225 ticket price, guests will enjoy a specially-prepared dinner and fine champagne.Cirque president and CEO Daniel Lamarre describes it as a creative collision of cuisine and immersive performances that is tailor-made for Cancún and the Riviera Maya.“We reveled in the creative challenge of introducing something completely different in Joya. Through the integration of premium food and beverage service into a Cirque du Soleil theatrical experience that draws on Mexico’s rich culture and heritage, Joya will deliver an immersive, multisensory offering beyond anything that currently exists for residents and visitors of Mexico, or elsewhere in the world.”The company’s creative director said Joya will be a tribute to the Mexican tradition in which knowledge is passed between generations, an example of which can be seen in “the marvelous art” of Mexico. “There is so much culture here,” said Richard Dagenais.Previous Cirque de Soleil shows have been well received in Mexico.“The relationship between Mexico and the Cirque has always been a very good one,” said Dagenais. “We’ve brought shows here for many years and we have an incredible fan base.“For that reason it was natural that we should do something specifically for the region.”That something will be a show that opens as a permanent fixture in Cancún on November 8, the Cirque de Soleil Riviera Maya.Joya follows the adventures of a rebellious teenage girl whisked away to a mysterious jungle in the fantastical world of her grandfather, an eccentric art collector.“Surrounded by a strange band of half-human, half-animal assistants, the extravagant naturalist is on a relentless quest for the meaning of life,” says the company’s press material.“When the reluctant Joya finds herself in this strange land, she must face a series of outlandish challenges that her mischievous grandfather has secretly set out for her. Is she ready to take over the quest her granddad inherited from his own ancestors?”“Inspired by the fabulous migratory journey of the monarch butterfly in which life is passed from one generation to the next to ensure the survival of the species, Joya reveals a world inhabited by entrancing characters that work hand in hand to perpetuate the love of life.”The show features performing artists from Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia, as well as Mexican talent, including acrobat Diana González.Source: Reforma (sp), Theme Park University (en)A 6-billion-peso, 90,000-square-meter shopping and lifestyle complex featuring a National Geographic entertainment center will open in November.A Mexican theater director will make her debut in London this weekend with a Mexico-inspired opera based on Jacques Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffman.Gerry Smith knows books and ‘Bola’ Domene knows music.

Trump arrived at the Istana, Singapore's government house, shortly before noon. He and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) are meeting one on one before they're joined by aides for a larger working lunch. In October, Trump praised the U.S. relationship with Singapore and called Loong a \"wonderful and loyal partner.\" Waiters were spotted near an elaborate dining room carrying Diet Cokes. That's Trump's beverage of choice. __ 11:55 a.m. President Donald Trump has arrived at Singapore's government house for a meeting with the island city-state's leader. Trump and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (lee haz-ee-en lahng) are meeting Monday at the Istana house. The two leaders are scheduled to meet one on one before an expanded working lunch with aides. The streets were lined with press and onlookers with cell phones as Trump's motorcade made its way from his hotel. Singapore is hosting Tuesday's unprecedented summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over dismantling the North's nuclear weapons program. Trump and Kim arrived in Singapore hours apart on Sunday night. Kim and Lee also met on Sunday. Trump will also meet with U.S. Embassy personnel later Monday. ___ 10:55 a.m. South Korea has started surveying South Koreans who would be willing to meet their war-separated relatives in North Korea for temporary reunions planned between the rivals as a reconciliatory measure. Seoul's Unification Ministry said Monday the surveys conducted through home visits, phone calls and letters will continue through Aug. 10. South Korea has lobbied hard for Tuesday's summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the future of Kim's nuclear program. Seoul says improved inter-Korean relations are important because North Korea wouldn't be willing to give up its nuclear weapons unless it feels its security has been assured. Kim's meeting with Trump comes after Kim's recent meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in (jah-YIHN'). The Koreas plan to hold military talks Thursday to reduce tension across their heavily armed border. ___ 9:20 a.m. President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un will start their historic summit with a one-on-one session with translators. A U.S. official says Monday that the leaders will meet for up to two hours before an expanded bilateral meeting with their respective advisers. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about internal deliberations and insisted on anonymity. Officials remain uncertain what will come out of Tuesday's unprecedented summit, the first of its kind between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea. Trump has said he wants to strike a deal to get the North to give up its nuclear weapons. He also has sought to lower expectations for the meeting, saying it may be the start of a longer process. ___ 6:50 a.m. North Korea's official media have reported that leader Kim Jong Un is in Singapore to meet President Donald Trump to discuss how to forge a new relationship. The first word Kim is in Singapore for Tuesday's summit came early Monday morning. Though North Koreans have been left largely in the dark about the summit, the reports of his arrival came relatively quickly by North Korean standards. A dispatch by the state-run Korean Central News Agency says Kim and Trump will exchange \"wide-ranging and profound views\" on establishing a new relationship, the issue of building a \"permanent and durable peace mechanism\" and realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The report notes the summit is being held \"under the great attention and expectation of the whole world.\" ___ 11:35 p.m. U.S. and North Korean officials are set to meet in Singapore to make final preparations for the summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, who has taken the lead on policy negotiations with the North, will hold a working group with a North Korean delegation at 10 a.m. Monday local time, or 10 p.m. Sunday on the U.S. East Coast. Sanders says Trump spent his flight from Canada to Singapore \"meeting with his staff, reading materials and preparing for his meetings in Singapore.\" Trump and Kim are set to meet at 9 a.m. Tuesday in Singapore, which is 9 p.m. Monday on the U.S. East Coast. ___ 10:30 p.m. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says the North Korean leader has already achieved some success just by bringing the American president to the table. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey says: \"To the extent that Kim Jong Un has already gone from international pariah to being normalized internationally, you have to say that he's had some success here.\" Menendez also stresses that getting a nuclear deal with North Korea will not be the hard point, noting that several previous presidents were able to strike deals only to see them fall apart. The test will be whether a deal has \"verifiable elements of a denuclearization,\" to prove whether the North has dismantled its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Menendez spoke Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" as President Donald Trump arrived in Singapore ahead of Tuesday's talks with Kim. ___ 8:25 p.m. President Donald Trump has arrived in Singapore where he will meet with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. Trump landed at 8:21 Sunday evening at the island city-state's Paya Lebar Air Base, traveling from Canada, where he attended a meeting of the Group of Seven Nations. Trump's high-risk meeting with Kim is scheduled for 9 a.m. Tuesday, or 9 p.m. June 11 on the U.S. East Coast. The president hopes to win a legacy-making deal with the North to give up their nuclear weapons, though he has recently sought to manage expectations, saying that it may take more than one meeting. This will be the first summit of its kind between a leader of North Korea and a sitting U.S. president. The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. ___ 7:10 p.m. Pope Francis has prayed that the summit this week between the U.S. and North Korean leaders succeeds in laying the groundwork for peace. Francis expressed hope Sunday that Tuesday's talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore will \"contribute to the development of a positive path that will assure a future of peace for the Korean Peninsula and the entire world.\" He invited the thousands of faithful in St. Peter's Square to pray with him so that the Virgin Mary \"accompany these talks.\" Francis said he wanted yet again to send \"a special thought in friendship and prayer\" to the beloved Korean people. ___ 6:50 p.m. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ahead of Tuesday's summit with President Donald Trump. Kim smiled broadly in the meeting Sunday evening. Kim told Lee: \"The entire world is watching the historic summit between the DPRK and the United States of America, and thanks to your sincere efforts ... we were able to complete the preparation for the historic summit.\" ___ 3:15 p.m. A plane presumably carrying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Singapore ahead of Kim's summit Tuesday with President Donald Trump. The jet landed at the airport Sunday afternoon amid huge security precautions on the city-state island. Kim is set to meet Tuesday with Trump in what's shaping up to be one of the most unusual summits in modern history. Despite the initial high stakes of a meeting meant to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons, the talks have been portrayed by Trump in recent days more as a get-to-know-each-other meeting. He has also raised the possibility of further summits.","header":" The Latest: Trump meeting Singapore PM ahead of Kim summit  ","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:11:36.542Z"},"time":"Monday, 20 August 2018"}

Singapore is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea. “It’s our contribution to an international endeavour which is in our profound interest,” Lee told reporters at the huge media centre the city-state had constructed to deal with the enormous demand.Over 2,500 journalists are covering the summit, the first between a sitting United States President and a North Korean leader. Lee said the cost of the summit for Singapore was 20 million Singapore dollars. “It is a cost we are willing to pay,” he said, adding that security costs would account for about half of that figure.The summit has the potential to set developments on the Korean Peninsula on a new path, Lee was quoted as saying by Straits Times newspaper. The summit is a plus for Singapore, he said.“It gives us publicity. The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting – we did not ask for it, but we were asked and we agreed – says something about Singapore’s relations with the parties, with America, with North Korea, also our standing in the international community,” he said.Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim met with Singapore Prime Minister Lee, hours after arriving here. Kim was greeted at Singapore’s Changi airport by Singapore’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan.Balakrishnan, an Indian-origin politician, had earlier visited Pyongyang and held talks with senior North Korean leaders to tie-up the details of the summit.According to images released by the Singaporean government, Kim arrived on an Air China plane. Accompanying him was Kim Yong Chol, who earlier this month met with President Trump to hand deliver a letter from Kim. Trump yesterday declared that the young dictator had a “one-time shot” to bring his country in from the cold with the summit.President Trump will arrive later today. The US hopes the summit will kick-start a process that eventually sees Kim give up nuclear weapons. Kim and Trump will sit down for talks at 9 am (6:30 am IST) on Tuesday at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa.Singapore has been used before for high-profile diplomatic occasions. In 2015, the leaders of China and Taiwan held historic talks in the city-state – their first in more than 60 years.","header":"Singapore to spend S$ 20 million for Trump-Kim summit: PM Lee","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:17:49.466Z"},"time":"\nMonday, August 20, 2018\n\n"}

The resort island was recently gazetted as a \"special event area\" by the Government.Meanwhile, it is believed that Mr Trump will stay at the Shangri-La Hotel off Orchard Road. Mr Kim is likely to reside at the St Regis Singapore.As June 12 draws near, here's a look at the trio of venues where summit activity is likely to be the busiest.The luxury hotel is set in a tranquil 15-acre site off Orchard Road, and has 747 hotel rooms spread over three wings, including 26 suites for heads of states and distinguished guests.The area surrounding the hotel had been declared a \"special event area\" for the period June 10 to 14.This means that security restrictions will be imposed in the area, and people and vehicles who enter the demarcated area will see stricter security measures and may be subjected to spot checks.Earlier, some observers had said that the gazetting of the area around Shangri-La Hotel raised the likelihood of the hotel being the venue of the summit.But with Capella Hotel being announced as the official summit venue by the White House, it is now likely instead that one of the two leaders will be staying at Shangri-La Hotel.The hotel's presidential suite, called the Valley Wing Shangri-La Suite, is where some experts think Mr Trump might stay during his visit. It has a private entrance and lift.It has also hosted former US presidents Barack Obama and George H.W. Bush.The hotel, which is located away from Singapore's main shopping belt and within a residential area, guarantees privacy for its guests.Crucially, it has solid experience in hosting high-security events, such as the landmark meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and then Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, and the Shangri-La Dialogue which attracts dozens of defence ministers each year.The gazetted area around Shangri-La Hotel includes other high-end hotels, including The St Regis Singapore.While previous reports had suggested that Mr Kim's preferred choice of lodging was the Fullerton, the hotel is not within any special zones gazetted by the Government for the summit.This increases the likelihood that Mr Kim will be staying at The St Regis instead, which is a nine-minute walk away from Shangri-La Hotel.The St Regis was the choice hotel for the Chinese delegation in 2015, when Singapore hosted a historic meeting between Mr Xi and Mr Ma.Located in Tanglin Road, a block away from the bustling Orchard Road belt, the hotel may not be able to provide the same sense of privacy that Shangri-La boasts.The hotel features 299 rooms and suites, including the lavish presidential suite on the hotel's highest floor on the 20th storey.The suite includes a bedroom, living room, dining room, office and terrace, and features a private balcony, jacuzzi, a gym and a butler service.Each room in the suite is lined with gold, and accented with brass, onyx and silver metals. The walls are adorned with hand-painted silk panels, with custom-made Czech crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.This luxurious hotel on the resort island of Sentosa was confirmed to be the venue for the summit by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday (Wednesday morning, Singapore time).The announcement came after the Singapore Government issued a public order gazetting the entire island as well as waters off its south-west beaches as a \"special event area\" from June 10 to 14.Earlier, it was reported that some US officials have been staying at the hotel, led by White House deputy chief of staff for operations Joe Hagin.The American delegation has been staying at the hotel to plan for the summit, according to previous reports.Before the summit was confirmed to be back on by President Trump, Mr Kim's de facto chief of staff Kim Chang Son was spotted spending a few hours at the Capella Singapore on May 31.Mr Kim Chang Son is believed to have been involved in high-level meetings with the American delegation, ahead of the summit.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

U.S. President Donald Trump and top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un will meet at the Capella Hotel on Singapore's Sentosa Island on Tuesday. (Xinhua/Li Peng) by Chen JianSINGAPORE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a summit meeting in Singapore on Tuesday, the first between incumbent leaders of the two countries since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.Trump kept open the possibility of ensuing meetings with Kim following the one in Singapore, which he said will hopefully start \"something big.\"\"Meeting in Singapore with North Korea (the DPRK) will hopefully be the start of something big ... We will soon see!\" he tweeted on June 5.POSITIVE STEPWhen announcing the reinstatement of the June 12 U.S.-DPRK summit, Trump said, \"It will be a beginning. I think you're going to have a very positive result in the end.\"Lee Sang-man, professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies of Kyungnam University in South Korea, viewed the DPRK-U.S. summit as a positive step toward a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\"It contributes much to the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization and lasting peace settlement,\" he told Xinhua. \"Coexistence and co-prosperity will come based on peace. With peace on the Korean Peninsula, peace will naturally come in Northeast Asia.\"Richard Haass, president of Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank, said that Trump \"appears to be embracing the idea of summit as the first step of gradual progress.\"In a tweet on June 1, the scholar said, \"This is the only way to advance if we are to avoid catastrophic failure of diplomacy or catastrophic success, ie, offering up too much to get a deal in Singapore.\"Acknowledging the wide strategic and ideological divisions between the United States and the DPRK, Robert Kelly, a political science professor at South Korea's Pusan National University, said, \"My expectation is that the summit will result in some small improvements, and then lead to a process that takes six months or a year.\"To extend good faith and commitment, both countries have sent out positive messages recently. Washington, in particular, seemed to have toned down the expectations for a cure-all agreement through one meeting.\"President Trump has already started to say that CVID (complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization) is unlikely and that this will take some time. So I think they're beginning to manage expectations,\" Kelly said.Dan Mahaffee, senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of Congress and the Presidency, believes that the resumption of dialogue and clearer expectations could provide a path forward.\"Hopefully ... dialogue can continue to lessen tensions, but with a realistic understanding of what are likely outcomes,\" he said.STICKING POINTS REMAINIn an encouraging sign, the DPRK decided to suspend its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests on April 21. It also dismantled its nuclear test site in the northeastern part of the country in late May.But achieving the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be a daunting challenge given the deep mistrust between Pyongyang and Washington, as well as their differences over what denuclearization would entail, experts said.\"Denuclearization means CVID for the United States, but from the viewpoint of North Korea, denuclearization means the denuclearization of the entire peninsula,\" said Masahiro Kohara, professor at the University of Tokyo.Calling for phased and synchronous measures for denuclearization, requiring reciprocal actions by the United States, what Pyongyang also wants in return for its relinquishment of nuclear weapons is a security guarantee from Washington as well as the lifting of sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the Unites States.\"Without the lifting of sanctions, the DPRK cannot exist as a normal state that normally engages in global trade and financial transactions,\" said Lee from Kyungnam University. \"The United States must guarantee there will be no regime change in the DPRK,\" he said.In addition, experts have pointed out a number of obstacles that will have to be addressed during and after the Singapore summit.\"There are many issues to discuss, from denuclearization to international assistance for North Korea,\" Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said.\"The key thing will be to establish a process by which each side moves a bit and gets rewarded with a parallel action from the other side,\" he said, adding only a win-win agreement will last for long.Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believed the tangible outcomes of the June 12 summit would be \"big-sounding, but achievable.\"Paal expected the summit to achieve \"grand objectives worded ambiguously, a tentative timetable for achieving them, and the designation of envoys to continue the process.\"\"It (the meeting) will be made to look like steps in the right direction for both sides, with details to follow,\" he said.

Trump's Air Force One landed at Singapore's Paya Lebar Air Base on Sunday evening about six hours after Kim's arrival at Changi Airport.\"We have to get denuclearization. We have to get something going,\" Trump told the media shortly before departing for Singapore from Charlevoix, Canada, where he attended the G7 summit and clashed with leaders of the six other nations over additional US steel and aluminum tariffs.He said, \"We appreciate everything that's going on\", adding \"we appreciate working together\" with the DPRK. \"They're really working very well with us.\"The optimism and confidence is a big contrast to just months ago when Trump and Kim engaged in a war of words, including trading personal insults. On May 24, Trump abruptly canceled the June 12 summit, but revived it eight days later. Tuesday's summit will be the first meeting between a sitting US president and a top DPRK leader.\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          Trump, Kim land in Singapore for historic summit\n        ","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:38:09.805Z"},"time":"AYANA Komodo ResortOnly 1 Hour Flight from Bali!

But Trump’s foreign policy is not what it once was. It is evolving in a somewhat unexpected way. A scheduled launch of Russia’s Soyuz rocket with a satellite aboard turned into quite an event in Russia after pictures of it heading into space baffled the whole country.People across Russia took to social media to post dazzling pictures and videos featuring a mysterious object flying over them in the night to Sunday. Searching for an explanation, some said it could have been a UFO. Others said the white oval object leaving a massive trail could be a sign that Russia’s state of the art ICBM Topol-M had been launched.This was before the match against Germany, which Mexico won! One can only imagine what ensued afterwards.This free-for-all is taking place at Metro Frunzenskaya, near Gorky Park.Muscovites are reporting that the city seems to be flooded with Mexicans - they have turned out in force to support their team. The rethinking in the headline is a reversal of my course, not that of the two presidents named.  As recently as a week ago, I was criticizing colleagues for advocating a US-Russia summit, saying that Trump was not ready for it, that his pursuing it could end badly for him and for our common cause of easing global tensions, which is détente spelled out in simple English.This article originally appeared on a new site about the Christian renaissance in Russia, called Russian Faith. Their introductory video is at end of this article.This article originally appeared on a new site about the Christian renaissance in Russia, called Russian Faith. Their introductory video is at end of this article.The Russian World Cup looks to break all records.Also, Russian fans with tickets get FREE! plane tickets to cities hosting games.

But he claims without his harsh rhetoric, their summit may never have happened. Trump is reflecting on his evolving rhetoric in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity in Singapore.Trump, who had threatened 'fire and fury' and called Kim 'Little Rocket Man,' said: 'I think without the rhetoric we wouldn't have been here.'He suggested that past administrations had what he called 'a policy of silence' and didn't respond when rivals 'said something very bad and very threatening and horrible'.Trump added 'That's not the answer.' He said of his rhetoric: 'I hated to do it. Sometimes I felt foolish doing it. But we had no choice.'Dennis Rodman says his trips to Pyongyang 'opened doors' ahead of the meeting between Kim Jong-Un and President Trump. Speculation is rife that Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize following Pyongyang's commitment to the 'complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. However, experts predict, it could be South Korea's president and not Donald Trump who will receive the award. Peter Wallensteen, a Swedish professor specialised in international relations, told AFT that South Korean President Moon Jae-in deserved to be included if ever a prize were awarded for peace in Korea.'Actually, Moon might be the one that deserves this the most, but that would be a slap against Trump!'Geir Lundestad, who served as secretary ot the Nobel committee between 1990 and 2014 said: 'Nobel is not a prize for saints. But you don't have to push this logic to the extreme either.' Lundestad said the efforts of Trump and Kim were welcome but there are problems with both men. He said: 'These two people have a lot of baggage: Kim is one of the worst dictators in the world and Donald Trump is in the process of tearing down the political and economic structures that the US set up after 1945 and that have benefitted everyone.' The European Union also praised today's 'historic summit' between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said it was 'our strong conviction that diplomacy is the only way forward towards lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula'.She said: 'Pursuing the diplomatic track is often challenging, but it is always rewarding. This Summit was a crucial and necessary step to build upon the positive developments achieved in inter-Korean relations and on the Peninsula so far, thanks to the leadership, wisdom and determination of the President of the Republic of Korea, Moon Jae-in.The ultimate goal, shared by the entire international community and as expressed by the United Nations Security Council, remains the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The Joint Statement signed by the U.S. and DPRK leaders today gives a clear signal that this goal can be achieved.'Europe's stocks markets faltered Tuesday as initial optimism faded over US President Donald Trump's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, dealers said.Frankfurt, London and Paris had shot higher at the opening bell, in tandem with gains across Asia, but ran out of steam as the morning progressed.Analyst Craig Erlam told AFP: 'The general reaction in the markets has been fairly muted.'While the outcome of the summit is generally positive and gives reason for optimism, there may also be an element of scepticism from investors in regards to what denuclearisation means, the timescale and whether the deal will be sustained.' Global equity markets had rallied Monday as traders brushed off a chaotic Group of Seven meeting to focus instead on Trump's summit with North Korea.However, markets were unhappy with the vague nature of the Tuesday's agreement, according to Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.He said: 'The markets began to unravel the optimism that propelled them higher on Monday, investors seemingly unsatisfied with what the vagueness of what was agreed between the US and North Korea.' The UN's nuclear watchdog today said it would help verify future agreements between the US and North Korea to dismantle Pyongyang's atomic weapons programme. Yukiya Amano, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency said: 'The IAEA will closely follow the negotiations to be held between the two countries to implement the outcomes of the US-DPRK Summit.'The IAEA stands ready to undertake any verification activities in the DPRK that it may be requested to conduct by the countries concerned.'According to AFP, last week Amano said the IAEA would be ready to restart inspection work in North Korea 'at short notice, within weeks, not months' if a political agreement were reached, adding that the agency would be able to mobilise 'many' staff if needed.In 2009 Pyongyang expelled IAEA inspectors from its Yongbyon nuclear site and has since refused to allow IAEA inspections on its territory.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov approved of US President Donald Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Interfax reported on TuesdayLavrov said: 'The mere fact of the meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea is positive ... We are following the comments that both sides are making but we have not seen the document yet, we'll see.' Former NBA star Dennis Rodman said President Obama had dismissed his attempts to broker peace between the US and North Korea. During an interview with CNN, he said: 'When I met Kim Jong-un, I didn't know what to expect...but once I got to know the culture over there I felt at home. South Korea is to seek urgent clarity from the US State Department following Donald Trump's decision to suspend annual war games between the two nations. Some 28,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea, however, Trump announced the training drills will be curtailed. A spokesman for the South Korean government said: 'At this point, we need to find out the precise meaning or intentions of President Trump's remarks.'President Donald Trump says he really believes North Korea's Kim Jong-un is going to make good on his promise to denuclearise.During an hour-long press conference in Singapore, he said he may be wrong about Kim, but he'll never admit it. Trump joked that he 'may stand before you in six months and say, \"Hey, I was wrong.\"'I don't know that I'll ever admit that.'President Trump said he was going to cost Canada 'a lot of money' after Justin Trudeau criticised the billionaire businessman following last week's G-7 summit. Speaking to reporters following his meeting with Kim Jong-un, Trump  recounted his recent tough exchanges with Trudeau. He says the Canadian leader must not have realised that Trump had televisions on Air Force One, allowing him to monitor Trudeau's news conference at the end of the G-7 summit. The president also recounted his discussions during the G-7 summit and his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the final document.Trump says the photo taken of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others standing before him was taken as they were waiting for changes he'd requested.Trump admitted it 'didn't look friendly' but it was 'very friendly'. German news paper Spiegel compared photographs of the two summits, with the caption: 'One week, two photographs'. The Iranian government has warned North Korea that Donald Trump could tear up today's nuclear deal without warning. Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, spokesman for the Iranian regime told the semi-official Fars news agency: 'We are facing a man who revokes his signature while abroad.' Nobakht's remarks are the first by an Iranian official after Trump and Kim concluded their nuclear summit. While flying for talks with Kim on Sunday, Trump rejected an agreement signed by the leaders of the G-7 countries at their summit in Canada. The US also pulled out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in May. President Donald Trump says he thinks 'we'll probably need another summit'- or at least a second meeting - with North Korea's Kim Jong-un as they discuss Kim's commitment to denuclearisation.But Trump told reporters in Singapore on Tuesday that he and Kim were able to cover far more ground than he'd expected. He says, 'We're much further along than I would have thought.' He told reporters following the meeting that North Korea has 'a substantial arsenal' of nuclear weapons and suggested today's meeting should have happened five years ago. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the joint statement signed by President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore as a first step in the denuclearisation of North Korea.He said: 'We see this as a step in a comprehensive resolution.' Japan wants North Korea to agree to a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.In the joint statement Kim committed North Korea 'to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula'.Abe added that he 'would like to thank the president (Trump) for raising the abduction issue,' referring to Japan's demand that Pyongyang release any remaining Japanese people it abducted to train its spies. China suggested on Tuesday that sanctions relief could be considered for North Korea if the country abides by United Nations resolutions, as US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work for denuclearisation.China has signed up for increasingly tough UN sanctions against its isolated neighbour following Pyongyang's repeated nuclear and missile tests, but has always said sanctions should be accompanied by talks for a political resolution.Speaking in Beijing following Trump and Kim's signing of a joint statement at the end of their historic summit in Singapore, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China has always strictly abided by all UN resolutions on North Korea.He said: 'The UN Security Council resolutions that have been passed say that if North Korea respects and acts in accordance with the resolutions, then sanction measures can be adjusted, including to pause or remove the relevant sanctions.' President Donald Trump says he had planned to place another 300 sanctions on North Korea recently, but he held off because it would be 'disrespectful' ahead of the meeting.Trump said Tuesday at a news conference in Singapore following his summit with Kim Jong-un that the U.S. will remove the sanctions already in place when they're assured that the nuclear weapons 'are no longer a factor.'He also says that it takes 'a long time to pull off complete denuclearisation' but that he will push for North Korea to remove its nuclear weapons as fast as it can 'mechanically and physically' be done. Trump has appeared largely unconcerned about the implications of feting an authoritarian leader suspected of ordering the public assassination of his half brother with a nerve agent, executing his uncle by firing squad and killing US college student Otto Warmbier.But Trump says without Warmbier's death, his meeting with Kim may not have happened. He says, 'Otto did not die in vain.'Trump says human rights did come up during the talks, albeit briefly.Trump says Kim Jong Un has accepted his invitation to visit the White House sometime in the future.The timing of the visit is not yet known. Today's visit to Singapore was the furthest Kim Jong-un has travelled from North Korea since taking over from his late father. Trump later said he was open to visiting the North Korean capital Pyongyang. Donald Trump said he wants to halt ongoing war games with South Korea and believes in the future he might be able to pull US troops out of the region. Speaking to the media after the US-North Korean talks, he announced the major policy shift. The US has had a continuous presence in the Korean peninsula since the 1950s. He also said he discussed the issue of human rights with the dictator. Trump suggested halting the regular war games will save the United States 'a lot of money'. He said: 'The war games are very expensive, we pay for the majority of them. Under the circumstances, that we're negotiating ... I think it's inappropriate to be having war games.'Trump says talks with Kim 'honest', 'direct', 'productive' after the North Korean dictator agreed to destroy a major missile engine testing site. The US president was addressing the media following his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un.Trump said Kim want's to 'de-nuclearise' the Korean peninsula and the president admitted he 'trusts' his his North Korean counterpart. He said he was 'prepared to start a new history' with the hermit state. Kim Jong-un left Singapore without addresssing the international media. Donald Trump has secured Kim Jong-un's agreement to return the remains of some 7,800 US troops who remain unaccounted for during the 1950-53 Korean War. In a joint statement signed by the leaders Tuesday, the countries committed to the recovery of the remains and the immediate repatriation of those already identified. The statement was otherwise filled with vague aspirational vows for peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Efforts to recover and return the remains have been stalled for more than a decade because of the North's nuclear development.North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has left the historic summit with US President Donald Trump to return to his hermit state. Kim spent 45 minutes in a one-on-one meeting with Trump, with only a pair of interpreters in the room to help with the talks. Commenting on the talks, President Trump praised his North Korean counterpart, claiming he was 'very worthy, very smart negotiator'. Trump says Kim has a 'great personality' and is 'very smart. Good combination.'Trump also says he learned Kim is 'a very talented man' and 'loves his country very much.'Former professor, Michel Riesen, who taught Kim when he was around 14-years-old in Switzerland says he would have absolutely learned basic English.  'He was a good student, but he wasn't extraordinary,' Riesen told NBC's Keir Simmons.Former White House National Security Council China director Paul Haenle branded the solo meeting between Donald Trump and and Kim Jong-un as 'a bad idea'. Mr Haenle, who served in the Obama and George W Bush administrations said: 'I could see Trump giving up a lot for very little in return.'Retired US Army general Barry McCaffrey was also concerned. He said the nature of the meeting was an 'unacceptable danger to U.S. national security.'He said: 'NSC should have TRANSCRIPT of all interactions with brutal, nuclear armed dictator.'Shanghai stocks recovered from early losses to end higher on Tuesday, as sentiment improved after US.President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a 'comprehensive' deal aimed at the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.The blue-chip CSI300 index ended 1.2 per cent higher at 3,825.95 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index ended up 0.9 per cent at 3,079.80 points, snapping a three-session losing streak.According to AP, there were no immediate details on the contents of the document, but Donald Trump said he expected the denuclearisation process to start 'very, very quickly'. Some called it the ‘bad hair summit’ or branded it the ‘hair conference' or ‘hair battle spectacular'. And thanks to the magic of Photoshop, social media was full of memes poking fun and mocking Trump and Kim for their unconventional hairstyles.The portly leaders are both known to enjoy their food. Kim reportedly has packed on weight so he could emulate his powerful grandfather.Trump notched just below obese in his first White House physical and is trying to lose 10 to 15 pounds.  US President Donald Trump said the North Korean denuclearisation process would be starting 'very quickly', as he and Kim Jong Un signed an unspecified document.US president Donald Trump said his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un went 'better than anybody could have expected'.\n\u0009    Share what you think\n          The comments below have not been moderated.We are no longer accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group","header":"Singapore summit LIVE: Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un sign document, shake hands and make history ","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:47:31.817Z"},"time":" Published: 07:29 BST, 12 June 2018 "}

US President Donald J. Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet at the Capella Hotel in Sentosa for a historic summit on June 12, 2018.Francesco Mancini is the Associate Dean, Co-Director, and Visiting Associate Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, as well as an Adjunct Associate Professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. New Europe’s Federico Grandesso spoke in an exclusive interview with Mancini about the upcoming meeting in Singapore between US President Donald J. Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un.NE: First of all, why do you think Singapore was selected as the best location for the summit? Singapore is truly a natural location for what we can call so-far the “summit of the century.” It is a friendly nation across the globe. It has had diplomatic ties with North Korea since 1975 and good relations with both the US and China. Singapore would not be a home turf for Kim, as opposed to anywhere near the DMZ, but he will still be in a friendly country.North Korea has an embassy in Singapore’s central business district, which can help with the elaborate logistical and protocol requests that will be part of the summit. It is also an ideal venue for the US as it is a large trading partner, the second-largest Asian investor and a long-time supporter of US military presence in the region. Its prime minister, Lee, has already been received at Trump’s White House. The Asian city-state can guarantee excellent security at the summit, due to the efficiency of its security forces and territorial control.Also, Singapore is closer than Europe for North Korea and allows for Kim’s private jet to reach the summit without having to refuel, and is not near the US, which means that Kim does not have to travel a longer distance than Trump. Finally, Singapore already has experience in hosting unprecedented summits. In 2015, it hosted a meeting between China’s Xi Jinping and Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, the first time the leaders met since 1949.NE: Who is going to benefit the most from this summit?I see already two clear winners. One is Singapore, as the host. It has put the country in the global news cycle and since this summit is more an event than an actual summit, Singapore has received a huge press exposure. News outlets are in Singapore for 4-5 days broadcasting their news from here, like they would do during the Olympics or a World Cup. That is quite extraordinary.Whatever happens after the summit, everybody will remember that the famous handshake happened in Singapore. The second obvious winner, even before going into the meeting, is Kim. He has managed to achieve three goals at once. First, he is not a pariah leader anymore. He has secured a summit with the US president, he has travelled to China and was visited by the Russians. He has basically legitimized North Korea as a nuclear state. And third, he has successfully loosened the grip on sanctions.As for Trump, he has secured a photo op of the century, even if nothing comes out of it. Notcoincidentally, the handshake should happen around 9 am Singapore time, primetime in the US.NE: What do you see coming out of the discussions?My expectation is that not much substance will be discussed at the summit. Trump might propose to move toward peace, not a full peace treaty (which requires US Senate approval and is politically difficult right now), but a pacification of the relations between the US and North Korea. He might even invite Kim to Mar-a-Lago to continue the conversation. But the details will not be there. These will be left to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former spy chief Kim Yong-chol to sort out.A long process is probably ahead.NE: How do you see the position of China in this regard?The fact is this is a long process that plays in favour of China. Today, the US may outshine China, but China will be the winner. A declaration of an agreement to end the Korean War is something that will undermine the rationale of keeping American troops in the Korean Peninsula. China’s position will be much stronger in the future, while the US will be weaker.China will become the key guarantor for North Korea, as well as an economic investor. China has so far played their hand beautifully and will be able to play, but with far larger strategic consequences. The real loser here is Japan, who risks being left out of the whole process. Trump has indicated that he is likely going to insist that Kim give up his ICBMs, but not shorter range weaponry. A fact that remains a key issue for Japan.NE: Can we hope for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula in the future?Regarding de-nuclearisation, I think CVID is pretty much off the table now. Kim has no reason to give up his nuclear capacity and reason to. It remains his ace in the hole when he needs it. He might commit to a process toward no proliferation and no ICBM capability, which might be enough to get some economic help that he so desperately needs.Trump might be happy enough with getting rid of IBMs, because he’ll look like he ensured the safety of US territory and I don’t think he cares about anything else. Again, it will be up to Pompeo to follow up on and to develop a plan for disarmament, and in this long process, China will, again, be a key influence due to its long-term strategy. In other words, the US and North Korea will have to start to playing the game of strategic reassurance. Credible assurance means both sides would have to forego their strategy of threat escalation. China and South Korea end up being key to this assurance game.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"Lee Kuan Yew university’s associate dean talks Trump-Kim summit","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:57:00.799Z"},"time":"Jun 6, 2018"}

Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during their historic meeting in Singapore; June 13, 2018. \u0008Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un signed a “historic” document concluding the unprecedented summit between a US president and a North Korean leader. Trump described the agreement as “comprehensive” and characterised it as embodying substantial commitments. Let’s analyse the agreement to see what was actually agreed. The agreement recites “President Trump committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK,” whilst Kim Jong-un “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.” Following this preamble, and a recognition that relations between the US and North Korea would be good for world peace, and confidence building can “promote” denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the two leaders “stated” four matters.  These are: first, the two sides committed to establish “new … relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity;” second, they will “join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula;” third, North Korea reaffirms the “April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration …[and] commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula;” and fourth, they “commit to recovering POW/MIA remains” and repatriate already identified remains. The agreement closes with a commitment “to implement the stipulations in this joint statement fully and expeditiously,” and hold further talks. This is not a legal agreement. It is merely a political agreement – both sides are making promises that cannot be enforced legally. A legal agreement – a treaty – is qualitatively different to this agreement signed by Trump. Under article 2, section 2, clause 2 of the US constitution, the president “shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.” This is an executive agreement – concluded solely by the president of the US. And he can terminate it when he pleases. Notably, the Iran nuclear deal or JCPOA was also an executive agreement. It was terminated solely by the president. So, Trump or his successor can rip this agreement with Kim to bits. If Kim was seeking a meaningful deal, based on the recent experience with JCPOA, he would have been safer with a treaty. To be sure, a treaty was unlikely because there was insufficient time to secure agreement on key matters. Then, the text shows the parties have not made substantial commitments. The first promise says “President Trump” – as distinct from the United States – “committed to provide security guarantees to the DPRK.” This is significant. The president committing to provide a security guarantee is arguably different from the US making such a promise. What kind of “security guarantee” can Trump provide? He can promise to abstain from regime change as long as he is in office. No more. Even if the US had entered into a non-aggression pact – a legal agreement – with DPRK, it would not mean much. History proves great powers rarely tie their hands and eliminate aggression when it is in their self-interest. Notably, the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact concluded between Hitler and Stalin in 1939 pledged non-aggression against each other. It was meaningless in the end. Similarly, the security guarantee would be worthless if North Koreans revolt against Kim or if North Korea threatens the US. No US president would be able to justify protecting a dictator suppressing his own people. The political cost would be too high. Obviously, if Kim threatens the US, the “security guarantee” would also be rendered nought. The commitment to “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” despite its “unwavering” and “firm” nature, is similarly meaningless. As noted previously, “denuclearization” has not been defined, and the US and DPRK disagree on its meaning. Turning then to the four statements, the first three are anodyne promises that don’t entail any significant change. Neither party is giving up anything. The fourth promise – to recover and repatriate POW/MIA remains is meaningful. It represents a good gesture by Kim. If the promises are not legally binding, what do they tell us about the parties’ intentions?Given that the commitments are non-legal, the context helps to understand intentions and forecast future developments.While we don’t know much about Kim’s perspective, the KCNA reports that “Kim Jong-un clarified the stand that if the US side takes genuine measures for building trust in order to improve the DPRK-US relationship, the DPRK, too, can continue to take additional goodwill measures of the next stage commensurate with them.” In other words, not yielding much. We have good contextual information about Trump’s views from his press conference post summit. Trump believes that Kim recognises the “tremendous potential for North Korea.” There is “no limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up nuclear weapons,” and “these are truly gifted people.” Second, echoing Kim, the president said “the past does not have to define the future” and “adversaries can indeed become friends.” This de-couples future initiatives from the previous failed record. Third, Trump said “only the most courageous can make peace” – seeming to break from his previous aggressive posture. Fourth, the agreement evidences an “unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization,” “it will be verified,” and “the language is very strong.” Fifth, he accepted that “it takes a long time to pull off denuclearization …scientifically it takes time …” but “when you hit a certain point you can’t go back.” Sixth, in a gesture of goodwill, Trump promised to “stop the war games which will save us a tremendous amount of money plus … it is very provocative.” Again, making a significant departure from past practice, Trump diplomatically stated it is “inappropriate to be having war games” when “we are signing a comprehensive agreement.” This is a sign of goodwill. Seventh, “sanctions will remain” until “the menace of nuclear weapons …[are] removed.” Trump claimed that he looks “forward to taking them off.” Eighth, human rights issues were “discussed relatively briefly,” but “will be discussed more in the future.” Ninth, Trump seems to recognise the dangers of military conflict and the severe risks of massive casualties. He said: “I don’t want to be threatening,” “Seoul has 28 million people – its right next to DMZ” and “you could have lost 20 million people, 30 million people.” Tenth, Trump thinks North Korea is to be trusted this time because Kim “did not have confidence in a president previously” and “because it is a different president.” Comparing the two positions, the agreement represents a first step in a long journey. In the final analysis, this is probably the best outcome in a bad situation. A major opening up of North Korea is unlikely because of entrenched doctrines of juche and songun (self-reliance and military-first). The regime’s Ten Principles also firmly set out Kim Jong-un-ism as the non-negotiable and foundational attribute of the country. In such circumstances, a major transformation would be suicide for Kim – if North Koreans are told to revise their views about the US and embrace capitalism they might topple Kim and seek justice for past wrongs. Therefore, Trump could only secure an agreement that may provide the foundation for a legal agreement in the future. It is a minor victory.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"North Korea Summit Yields Trump Political Victory But Not Binding Commitments","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:57:16.122Z"},"time":"Jun 18, 2018"}

The European Commission has given the green light to clear an EU-Singapore trade and investment agreements that aim to take bilateral relations to a new level and comes on the heels of the recently signed EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement,The speed by which Brussels moved to wrap-up both agreements is being seen as an effort to send a strong message to US President Donald J. Trump about the EU’s approach to fair and rules-based international trade.The EU-Singapore pacts are the first bilateral trade and investment agreements concluded between the EU and a Member State of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and will serve as a reference point for other trade and investment agreements, including negotiations between the EU and Malaysia that were launched in 2010, as well as similar ongoing talks between the EU, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia that began in 2012.The EU-Singapore deal is the most significant as the wealthy city-state is by far the EU’s largest ASEAN partner, with total bilateral trade in goods at €53.3 billion in 2017 and services at €44.4 billion in 2016.Unlike past agreements, the EU-Singapore trade agreement is one of the first ‘new generation’ bilateral agreements that not only remove customs duties and non-tariff barriers for trade in goods and services but also includes important provisions on intellectual property protection, investment liberalisation, public procurement, competition, and sustainable development.According to the European Commission, the day the trade agreement enters into force, over 80% of all imports from Singapore will enter the EU duty-free. European tariffs will be removed within three or five years for the remaining 20%, depending on the product category.Electronics, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and processed agricultural products will be prioritised, as the deal removes technical and non-tariff barriers to trade in these specific goods.The EU and Singapore have also agreed to base their technical and safety regulations on international standards. Both sides also agreed to promote international safety and manufacturing standards for cars and car parts, outside of the electronics industry.Both Brussels and Singapore will conform to international standards and guidelines for pharmaceutical products and medical devices, particularly those developed by global standard-baring bodies.Enhanced customs cooperation will simplify and modernise trade procedures and cut transaction costs for businesses. Singapore will make it easier for EU companies working in the fields of telecommunications, environmental services, engineering, computing, and maritime transport to operate in the country, a move that was reciprocated by the EU, which ruled that European commercial banks will, under specific conditions, be able to increase their number of customer services locations.Singapore has agreed to strengthen its existing geographical indications (GI) regime by setting up a system to register GIs in Singapore. Around 190 GIs for wines, spirits, and certain agricultural products including Bordeaux wines, Parma ham, Champagne, and Bayerisches Bier will be treated as being within the EU Member States.The agreements will first have to be approved by the European Council and sent to the European Parliament before possibly coming into force before the mandate of the Juncker Commission ends in May 2019.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"EU and Singapore successfully on Trade and Investment Protection Agreements","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:57:47.712Z"},"time":"Apr 19, 2018"}

Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK were among the first to recognise Singapore as a sovereign state.  Our navy’s first gunboats were jointly-produced by German and British firms, while our first military pilots were trained in the UK.  On the economic front, the late Dutch economist Dr Albert Winsemius was a key architect of our export-driven development strategy.The Singapore-Europe relationship has blossomed into a deep and comprehensive partnership that is based on enduring mutual interestsThe Singapore-Europe relationship has blossomed into a deep and comprehensive partnership that is based on enduring mutual interests.  At the political level, Singaporean and European leaders regularly exchange visits.  At the people-to-people level, over 1.5 million Europeans visited Singapore in 2013. The 60,000-strong European community in Singapore has greatly enriched our society.  As for economic links, the EU is the largest investor in Singapore, while Singapore is the EU’s second-largest Asian investor.  Bilateral trade amounts to over €60bn per year.  Defence relations remain strong, with equipment purchases flowing in both directions.  Cultural ties are similarly flourishing – 2015 will see a number of cultural events held in various European cities to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Singapore’s independence.  These include the Singapore Festival in France 2015 and Singapore’s return to the Venice Biennale.The Singapore-Europe relationship will undoubtedly continue to evolve, in no small part due to the important changes taking place in the world today.  Propelled by the rapid growth of emerging economies such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam, the 21st century will make the Asia-Pacific a dynamic region.  The 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”) economies represent 55% of the world’s GDP and conduct 44% of its trade.  The Asian Development Bank further predicts that, by 2050, Asia could account for more than half of global GDP, trade and investment.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”), comprising ten Southeast Asian countries (including Singapore), lies at the heart of the dynamic Asia-Pacific region.  In 2015, the ASEAN countries are due to form an ASEAN Economic Community, a single market and production base with 600 million consumers and a strong economic outlook.  The ASEAN economy will be one of the top ten economies in the world today.Europe’s long-term prosperity will be enhanced if it fully taps into the economic vibrancy of ASEAN. The EU is in a good position to step up its engagement through fora such as the ASEAN-EU Dialogue Partnership, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the Asia-Europe Meeting. I welcome the EU’s decision to appoint its first dedicated Ambassador to ASEAN.  The EU has also embarked on bilateral trade negotiations with Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, all of which will serve as building blocks for deeper region-to-region economic collaboration.  Against this backdrop, the recently-concluded EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (“EUSFTA”) and EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (“ESPCA”) take on special significance.The EUSFTA will bring substantial benefits to both parties.  The EU enjoys a €11.6bn trade surplus with Singapore, and will benefit from the tariff-free access and recognition of Geographical Indications.  European companies in Singapore, which currently number 10,400, will benefit from ASEAN cumulation and Singapore’s network of FTAs to increase their exports to rapidly-growing markets.  It is estimated that the EUSFTA will boost EU exports to Singapore by €1.4bn and EU real GDP by €550m over 10 years.   The EUSFTA will also stimulate green growth by removing obstacles to trade and investment in environmentally-friendly technologies.  Strategically, the EUSFTA – the EU’s first such agreement with a Southeast Asian country – will enhance the EU’s engagement of Asia, and serve as a springboard to an eventual EU-ASEAN FTA.  It is therefore vital that the EU ratifies the EUSFTA as soon as possible and send a strong signal that Europe remains open for business.  Such bilateral initiatives, along with mooted region-to-region agreements like the EU-ASEAN Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement, will augment connections, boost growth and create jobs to the benefit of the EU’s and ASEAN’s 1.1 billion citizens.Even as we celebrate Singapore’s 50th birthday, we are not resting on our laurels; we are now looking forward to the next 50 years.  We are investing in our people by providing rigorous and broad-based education up to the university level and implementing bold social policies.  In particular, we are focussing extensively on ensuring that our young people can access skills-based education, and not just focus on getting a university degree, so that they can compete in the modern world economy.  We are also enhancing our physical infrastructure by doubling our train network and expanding our airport.  In the next 50 years, we hope to become an exceptional global city with a thriving economy, where Singaporeans have good jobs whilst enjoying a high-quality life with families and friends.  In realising this vision, we remain committed to the values that have underpinned our success – incorruptibility, meritocracy, multi-culturalism, democracy and openness to the world – values that Europe shares. I am confident that the EU will continue to make positive contributions to the success and prosperity of Singapore and the region.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"Singapore and Europe: 50 Years of relations","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T15:58:03.256Z"},"time":"Jan 4, 2015"}

Kim told Xi he hoped to work with China and other parties to push the peace process, Chinese state television said.Asked about Kim's latest Beijing visit, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, \"we are watching it closely\". She said Washington was in continuing communication with the North Korea government and added: \"We look forward to them following through on their commitments and agreements that they made last week at the summit.\"At the Singapore summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, Kim reaffirmed a commitment to \"work towards complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\", while Trump said he would end \"provocative\" joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises.Although Trump has hailed the Singapore summit as a success, sceptics have questioned whether he achieved anything new, given that Pyongyang, which has rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament, appeared to make no new concrete commitments.The United States has led an international sanctions drive to press North Korea to abandon development of nuclear weapons capable of reaching the United States and Trump has expressed concern that China may be easing up on its enforcement of these steps.South Korea and the Pentagon announced they would halt the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian military drill scheduled for August.At the summit, Trump also said North Korea had agreed to return remains of U.S. soldiers missing from the 1950-53 Korean War and U.S. officials said on Tuesday that that process could start within the next few days.While not formally billed as a state visit, China gave Kim most of the trappings of one, including a welcome ceremony with honour guard in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.Xi greeted Kim warmly, in images carried on state television. The two men were accompanied by their wives.Xi said he was pleased to see North Korea's decision to promote economic reforms, adding that China's own reform and opening up process had meant the Chinese people's eyes had been open to the world. North Korean state media had not mentioned Kim's visit by early evening.A Kim trip to China to discuss his summit with Trump had been widely anticipated in diplomatic circles. China is North Korea's most important diplomatic and economic backer but has been angered by its nuclear and missile tests.South Korea's foreign ministry spokesman said South Korea and China shared the strategic goal of completely denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\"Our government hopes China will play a constructive role in resolving this problem,\" ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-deok told a regular briefing. \"We hope Chairman Kim Jong Un's visit will contribute to that.\"'DUAL SUSPENSION'China has welcomed the warming of ties between the United States and North Korea, and offered to help. It has been particularly pleased by Trump's decision to suspend military drills with South Korea. It has long proposed a \"dual suspension\", whereby North Korea stops weapons tests and the United States and South Korea stop military drills, to encourage talks.\"South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom Guardian military drill scheduled for August,\" South Korea's defence ministry said in a statement. The Pentagon confirmed the suspension, adding that the secretaries of defence and state as well as Trump's national security adviser would meet on the issue this week.Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops joined the Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills, although the exercise is mostly focussed on computerized simulations rather than field exercises.The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.The decision to halt military exercises in South Korea has bewildered many current and former U.S. defence officials, who only learned about it when Trump announced it in Singapore, after the summit with Kim.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which regularly practise to deter North Korea. \"The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations' defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan,\" Suga told a regular briefing.Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said the decision to suspend the U.S.-South Korean exercises was made to support the diplomatic effort between the United States and North Korea but added it was \"important to be wary of North Korea actions\".\"Our view of the threat has not changed. Joint training is an important in maintaining peace and stability in the region,\" he said.

The president announced Saturday that he was pulling the U.S. out of the Group of Seven's official statement of common values and accusing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host of the conference, of \"false statements.\"But with the G-7 in his rearview mirror, Trump seemed ready to focus on North Korea.

He flew in his personal Ilyushin-62M jet accompanied by a cargo plane that people with knowledge of North Korean affairs say is believed to have carried his limousine.    \"It looks very much like the trip to Dalian was a dry run,\" said Andray Abrahamian, a research fellow at Pacific Forum CSIS and formerly with Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based group that trains North Koreans in business skills.    At 4,700 km from Pyongyang's Sunan airport, Singapore is easily in the range of the Il-62M aircraft. The Soviet-era narrow-body jet with four engines was first introduced in the 1970s and has a maximum range of 10,000 km.But the Ilyushin-76 cargo plane cannot fly more than 3,000 km without refuelling if carrying a full load. It will therefore have to stop off at a friendly location like Vietnam’s capital on the way to Singapore or fly with a reduced load.    The Il-76, originally designed for moving heavy machinery to remote parts of the Soviet Union, is big enough to fit a school bus or two shipping containers inside it, according to passenger and cargo flight operator Antarctic Logistics \u0026 Expeditions.    But the cargo plane has had some safety issues. In the latest incident last month, a crash killed 257 people on board after takeoff from an Algiers air base.   Unlike his father Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011 and who travelled by armoured train on his rare trips abroad because he feared being shot down, according to a North Korean defector familiar with his security details, the younger leader is not known to be averse to flying.    But air travel of this distance does pose a significantly greater challenge in transporting communication and security equipment and personnel needed to back up a summit meeting.        SUITE FIT FOR A LEADER    Lee Yun-keok, a defector who had worked for the North's government and now heads the North Korea Strategic Information Service Center in Seoul, said the trip will involve dozens of security personnel and equipment including possibly a personal toilet for the leader.    It will also mean burning a large quantity of jet fuel, a refined oil product sharply limited by U.N. sanctions targeting North Korea’ imports. Kim's two planes will need around 50 metric tons of jet fuel per aircraft for the flight from Pyongyang to Singapore.     China, the main source of fuel for the North, exported just 3 tons of jet fuel in March and made no official exports the two previous months, according to Chinese customs data. But the North's planes can pick up extra fuel when they fly to China and Russia for commercial operations, and international security experts believe the North may have been stockpiling the fuel which it has also used for its missile programme.     “The United States had preferred Geneva,\" the South Korean presidential official told reporters, requesting anonymity to discuss the arrangements for the summit meeting.    \"But Singapore was selected as it was the most realistically viable destination Kim Jong Un could probably travel when considering the travel time and flight distance.\"    The two sides initially considered meeting in the Panmunjom truce village straddling the Korean military border, the scene of the third inter-Korea summit attended by Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month, the official said. The official said the South did not know the reason why Panmunjom was dropped.    There was no confirmation on the specific location for the meeting between Kim and Trump although there are a number of sites in Singapore that can guarantee security protection, including hotels that have experience hosting high-security events, Singapore media and a Singapore government official said.Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the country was \"honoured to host it, and would do our best to facilitate a smooth and successful meeting,\" in a telephone call with Trump on Friday. Trump said the summit would contribute to resolving the long outstanding issue of securing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, Singapore's foreign ministry said.    The meeting is scheduled for one day on June 12, but if either or both of the leaders decide to stay overnight, there is only one hotel room in all of the city that meets “security protocol\" for the U.S. president, according to a source with knowledge of previous U.S. presidential visits.    That is the 348-square meter Shangri-la Suite in the Valley Wing of the hotel of the same name, at a current rate of S$10,000 ($7,500) a night for June 12.

Americans will sweep for bugs in rooms at the Capello Hotel that could be used for side discussions, and could erect tents inside hotel meeting rooms to block any concealed cameras from viewing classified documents.Chinese intelligence agencies have shown the ability to penetrate mobile phones even when they are off, and U.S. officials are now told to take their batteries out when they are concerned about eavesdropping, according to a U.S. intelligence official.\"Chinese intelligence collection could be amped up around the summit,\" said Jeremy Bash, an NBC News analyst who was chief of staff to CIA Director Leon Panetta. \"They have prioritized surveillance in recent years and their technical prowess has really advanced.\"For years, the Chinese have engaged in a massive effort to recruit human spies in the West, and can call on an army of skilled hackers to gather intelligence from the web.But recently Chinese intelligence agencies have grown more creative and adept, U.S. officials say, posing an increasing threat to America's secrets.\"China remains a particularly aggressive espionage actor and is using increasingly sophisticated technological platforms to carry out its objectives,\" said Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, the DNI's new counterintelligence agency.According to three U.S. officials, in one recent case a top U.S. official working in China repeatedly had trouble with his hotel key card. He had to replace it several times at the front desk because it wouldn't open his door.He brought one of the key cards back to the U.S., where security officials found a microphone embedded inside, according to the U.S. officials.The Chinese have placed listening and tracking devices in chips embedded in credit cards, key chains, jewelry, and even event credentials, the officials said, often with the intent of capturing secret conversations among American officials.In advance of Chinese President Xi Jinping's 2017 meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's south Florida estate, White House officials received detailed briefings on how the Chinese would try to spy on them during the visit \"in every possible way,\" said an official who was part of the visit.And U.S. officials \"swept all of our phones afterward\" to check if they were infiltrated by the Chinese, the official added.Seven months later when Trump traveled to Beijing, White House officials were given more extensive briefings, according to officials who were on the trip, in which they were told to assume the Chinese would be tracking, taping and watching them the entire time they were in the country.During the visit, the officials say the Chinese gave the U.S. delegation pins that the Americans called their friendship pins. But members of the delegation were not allowed to wear the pins into a secure area because security officials warned they likely had embedded listening devices.The officials said their belongings were rifled through while they were not in their hotel rooms, as happened to U.S. officials during previous presidential trips to China. Some senior members of Trump's delegation packed carry-on bags with anything they didn't want the Chinese to see and took the bags wherever they went, including out to dinner in restaurants, according to officials.\"All’s fair in love, war and espionage.\"Even inside the U.S., the surveillance can be brazen. During a meeting between senior U.S. military officials and a Chinese military delegation several months ago at the Pentagon, one of the Chinese generals didn't hide his efforts to record the meeting, pointing his large watch in the direction of the Americans whenever they spoke, according to two officials familiar with details of the meeting.That story is among the anecdotes detailed in a recent internal report by the Defense Department and the intelligence community about the threat of surveillance inside the Pentagon.Defense Department spokesman Chris Sherwood declined to discuss the report, saying, \"We don't comment on intel nor on specific threat reports.\"According to Daniel Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, \"all's fair in love, war and espionage.\"Russel, who is now vice president at the Asia Society, added:, \"There's an awful lot that the Chinese do to us that we do, or try to do, to them. But as technology improves, the capabilities of the Chinese to collect become increasingly sophisticated.\"The real story is the incredible acceleration of technology, artificial intelligence, data gathering and monitoring.\"Cellphones can also be vulnerable. After President Barack Obama's first trip to China in 2009, one of his national security advisers had to throw away a Blackberry device because the Chinese had penetrated it, a former administration official said.Trump's reported use of non-secure cell phones in the White House is a massive security risk, experts say. Because smart phones can be turned into bugs and location tracking devices, Obama was not allowed to have one until 2016, and even then, he joked about how little functionality it had.It's been widely reported that Trump has rebuffed efforts by security officials to get him to use a secure mobile device, and he has been using standard-issue smart phones for Twitter and to place calls.The Washington Post reported this week that the Department of Homeland Security has found evidence of the use of sophisticated technology to intercept cell phone calls outside the White House, a type of technology that is available commercially and U.S. officials say Chinese and other foreign intelligence agencies regularly use.One former senior U.S. official said the Chinese have good intelligence collection operations in Singapore.\"What they would want to get is to know what people in the meetings said and what happened,\" the official said, and to get inside U.S. government officials' phones and computers.During other trips to China during the Obama administration, U.S. officials took increasingly strict steps to minimize any intelligence gathering from their meetings or devices. The Chinese would put microphones in U.S. officials' hotel rooms, credentials and the friendship pins featuring each country's flag, officials said.Officials were not allowed to bring those items into any meetings or secure area, instead leaving them outside those rooms, and always leaving them behind in China. U.S. officials also would leave any personal electronic devices on a government plane while in the country. The Chinese would similarly spy on reporters traveling with the president.U.S. government employees based in China are now told to presume their residences are wired for sound and video, and that the Chinese have recorded what they say or do at home, according to officials. Cabinet and other government officials are briefed on China's spying techniques, including the possibility that their hotel rooms could be wired.U.S. officials said the presumption on any visit to China or any interaction with Chinese officials outside the country is that Beijing would be trying to collect intelligence on the Americans or otherwise compromise them.Just this week, two U.S. intelligence officials appeared in court to face charges of spying for China, and a third suspected Chinese agent, former CIA officer Jerry Lee, faces trial next year.American officials fear the Chinese are making use of a massive trove of federal personal data they stole in 2015 to identify and target vulnerable intelligence officers, two U.S. officials told NBC News.\"China poses the most sophisticated counterintelligence threat to the U.S. of any other country right now,\" said Bash. \"And their intelligence gathering is probably at its highest peak in a long time.\"","header":"How China could spy on Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:06:23.496Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  08/06/2018\n"}

(June 8)\n    APSEOUL — If there’s anything Singapore is known for, it’s law and order.The wealthy city-state of 5.5 million famously fines people thousands of dollars for littering, has banned chewing gum from the streets and still uses caning as a punishment for minor crimes. Singapore’s security is also legendary, which is one major reason it was selected for the historic summit meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which will be held on Tuesday at the five-star Capella Resort on Sentosa Island. The country has pulled off other high-stakes meetings in the past, including a 2015 summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwan's president at the time, Ma Ying-jeou. Singapore also hosts a major annual defense conference every year that draws political leaders and military brass from around the world.But the meeting between Trump and Kim is unprecedented, and Singapore is pulling out all the stops to ensure the summit runs smoothly.Singapore’s Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam called the summit a \"major show of confidence\" in the country. More: Trump's goal of total 'denuclearization' of North Korea is a long shotMore: Here's Kim Jong Un's wish list for the Singapore summit with President Trump\"They believe that we, Singapore, can provide a safe and secure venue. ... We are a little red dot, but we are a serious member of the international community,” he said.While the summit is scheduled for one day, Singapore has declared it an “enhanced security special event,\" with special rules in effect from June 10-14. A security perimeter will cover Sentosa Island as well as the shoreline of the mainland and will extend about 650 feet out to sea. Singapore’s airspace will also be tightly restricted in the days surrounding the summit.Heightened security checks of people and vehicles will be in effect near the summit location and a wide range of items are banned, including drones and firearms as well as anything that could be used to make public statements or protests, such as aerosol paint cans, loudspeakers and any flag or banner larger than roughly three feet by three feet. In Washington, the White House continues to prepare and the agenda for the meeting remains fluid. The Trump administration's negotiations with North Korea have been unusual when compared to past administrations – something Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says will lead to success. \"The approach that President Trump is taking is fundamentally different,\" Pompeo said. \"In the past, there have been months and months of detailed negotiations, and it got nowhere. This has already driven us to a place we've not been able to achieve before.\"Trump has said that \"one-week preparations\" for a big event simply \"don't work,\" and that his life experience makes him ready to deal with the North Koreans. \"I've been preparing for this all my life,\" the president told reporters Friday. The summit will also take place under a stringent new anti-terrorism law that Singapore passed last month, which gives the police extraordinary powers in the case of a terrorist attack, including banning journalists and the public from reporting on it. \nThe measure gives the police the power to block all communications on the site of an attack – including photos, video, text and audio messages – for up to a month. More: Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un hold a role reversal summit: Meet first, then dealMore: No one leaves early, and 4 other key things for a successful Trump-North Korea summitThe country is already hardly a bastion of media freedom, ranking 151st out of 180 countries on a Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Border.\nSingapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs, which drafted the law, said that the city-state faces a “clear and present terrorism threat, posed by home-grown radicalized individuals and foreign terrorists.”The country has also made it clear that it doesn’t welcome foreigners holding political assemblies or rallies in Singapore. A law passed in 2017 gives the police the authority to reject applications for events that are seen as being “directed toward a political end.” Heightened security efforts for the summit have already been used against at least one suspect, as Singapore announced that it rejected entry for an Australian former terror suspect on Thursday. Zeky Mallah, who was charged in 2003 for allegedly planning a suicide attack on Australian government buildings, was barred from Changi Airport on Wednesday and sent back on a flight to Sydney the next day. Mallah had been the first person charged under Australian terror laws. He was acquitted of plotting the terrorist attack, but later was jailed for admitting that he threatened government officials. Singpaorean officials told local media that Mallah had also traveled to Syria and had expressed support for Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist groups.Contributing: David Jackson, USA TODAY","header":"Why was Singapore chosen for Trump-Kim summit?

Reuters reported that Kim may leave Singapore at 2 p.m. Tuesday, five hours after the start of the meeting with Trump. Trump had been scheduled to leave Singapore on Wednesday morning, but that departure was moved up to Tuesday night. The president is likely to take questions before heading back to the USA.Other topics that may surface at the summit include negotiations for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, which technically still exists under a cease-fire reached in 1953.In making final preparations for the Kim summit, Trump spoke by phone Monday with interested parties in the region, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe visited Trump at the White House last week.The South Korean government said in a statement that Moon offered his assessment of Kim and wished the U.S. president an early happy birthday. Trump turns 72 Thursday.A successful summit \"would be a big present for the world, as well as a good present for President Trump's birthday,\" the South Korean statement said.Trump and aides said they do not expect to sign a major denuclearization agreement at this summit. Instead, they are looking for a commitment from Kim to move forward on negotiating the details of a complete and verifiable dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons programs.After the summit, Pompeo said, \"there's going to be a lot of work left to do.\"Trump offers to lift economic sanctions on North Korea and provide other forms of economic assistance if the regime agrees to give up its nuclear weapons programs.

Here's a look at what we can expect in the coming months.\n    USA TODAYThe world has certainly come a long way since last year, when North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (the \"little rocket man\") threatened an atomic attack on the United States, and President Trump (the \"dotard\") responded by saying that his nuclear button was a lot bigger than Kim’s.Their just-concluded summit in Singapore was great theater, and a welcome relief from all the warmongering. The imagery of a U.S. president standing side-by-side with a North Korean despot was an astonishing sight that few would have predicted just months ago. The agreement signed by Kim and Trump was historic and potentially groundbreaking. The sense of hopefulness emerging from the summit, however, has to be leavened with a heavy dose of skepticism.Kim committed \"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” but the details are murky and indefinite. So far, there is no timetable and no plan for verifying that the brutal regime is unwinding its cherished nuclear program.The world has been down this road before. In 1994, for example, Kim Jong Il, father of the current leader, agreed with President Clinton to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, the main producer of fissile material. That agreement lasted for all of two years.Will this one be any different? Hard to say.Perhaps most troubling about the Kim-Trump agreement is how much the United States has already given up. This includes the U.S. pledge to halt what Trump called \"provocative\" military exercises in the region and, more significant, Trump’s willingness to legitimize Kim on the world stage by appearing with him and buttering up the totalitarian ruler as a \"very talented\" and trustworthy leader.\"He’s a funny guy, he’s very smart, he’s a great negotiator. He loves his people,” Trump told Voice of America contributor Greta Van Susteren — words of flattery that, if spoken by a Democratic president, would have Republicans howling. The Singapore summit came about largely because of Trump’s eccentric and highly egocentric approach to foreign policy. Prior presidents started negotiations with North Korea at a relatively low level and allowed them to rise only as progress was made. It's possible that Trump’s top-down approach might prove more effective.But it is just as likely to be an impediment. Trump’s agree-first, negotiate-later approach carried an air of desperation. Having angered many of America’s longtime allies and facing difficult midterm elections, Trump needed a diplomatic victory. Kim, too, was looking to enhance his standing back home.One of the great ironies is that a successful Korea deal — the dismantling of a nuclear program in return for economic security — would look a lot like President Obama's Iran agreement, which Trump recently trashed.Whether the Singapore agreement represents sustainable progress toward reducing the risk of nuclear war, or just more of the same, might not be known for months or even years. For now, it's worth letting the process play out, as there remain no good military options on the Korean Peninsula. USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

Here's a look at what we can expect in the coming months.\n    USA TODAYLast fall, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were trading personal insults and threatening nuclear war. Fast-forward to the Singapore summit, and the two men are smiling and talking on the Island of Tranquility. Just like that, peace broke out.The two leaders signed a joint statement that marked the beginning of a process for North Korea’s complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. Progress on other issues may follow, such as improvement in human rights and political reform, economic openness and perhaps reunification with South Korea. We will see. But the two men have given birth to a new world of possibilities that no thoughtful person can see as anything but good.Naturally, there has been no lack of criticism of the summit. But anti-Trump mania drives most of the critical narrative, rather than a reasoned analysis of strategic opportunity. The president was mocked for being overconfident, even as he approached the summit with repeated cautions that perhaps nothing would result.More: Donald Trump's off-the-cuff summit with Kim Jong Un might succeed. Here's why.More: Donald Trump should think again before North Korea summit in SingaporeHe was scoffed at for being an amateur in foreign policy, a reality TV star in over his head and ill-prepared. But as Dilbert creator Scott Adams pointed out, Trump has spent his entire 50-year career making deals, while young dictator Kim has never had to negotiate anything.We saw a preview of the power dynamic when the president walked away from the table two weeks ago and North Korea blinked.Now the supposed experts, pundits, former officials and other naysayers will have to eat their words. Trump the diplomatic novice — with an assist from eccentric former basketball great Dennis Rodman — is achieving what the cream of Ivy League-educated Washington swamp-dwellers could not.So is this just Big Mac diplomacy, trading a McDonald's on every corner for an end to Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions?Not at all. The Singapore summit was the product of the politics of power and interest. President Trump’s most important diplomatic move came over a year ago when he explicitly linked the North Korean issue to trade negotiations with China, which no previous president had attempted. This was the key point of leverage, bringing Beijing to understand that it could not continue to support its North Korean ally without cost.Pyongyang’s growing nuclear ballistic missile capabilities potentially threatened the U.S. mainland and thus presented an unacceptable risk. Washington asserted a credible threat of force against this threat. Beijing’s choices were to pressure Kim to negotiate, or to suffer not only trade consequences but also the probability of direct U.S. military action against North Korea. It was an easy choice for Beijing, which suspended iron, coal and lead imports from North Korea, and cut off Pyongyang’s access to Chinese banks.With his meager economic lifelines being cut, Kim had no other realistic choice but to meet with Trump. This alignment of interests was the art of the deal in action.More: Don't let Donald Trump erase Otto Warmbier from the Singapore summit with Kim Jong UnPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, mediaMaybe Kim understands the strategic disutility of nuclear weapons for developing nations and wants to shift what little resources he has back to economic development. There is literally nowhere to go but up for his backward country. In return for ending its nuclear program North Korea will see an end to sanctions, be given access to international markets, and enjoy security guarantees from the United States.Kim may also agree to expose North Korea’s illicit transnational nuclear and missile network, which includes Iran and Syria. That would be another counterproliferation coup for our “amateur diplomat” president.In signing this agreement, Kim has torn up the traditional Pyongyang playbook. Of course, we must recognize North Korea’s track record of cheating on previous agreements. It is possible that this is all a ruse, but it is unlikely that Kim is pulling a fast one.He has too much to gain by sticking to the agreement and everything to lose by breaking it. The emerging diplomatic process with North Korea will move forward because it is in everyone’s interest for it to succeed.

Nathan Rousseau Smith has the story.\n    Buzz60The island that houses the luxury resort in Singapore where President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will hold their historic summit next week has a dark past.The 5-star Capella Hotel, located a quarter-mile off the mainland, promises the \"tranquility\" of Sentosa Island amid the bustle of the \"cosmopolitan\" city-state, according to the hotel's website.But Sentosa Island — now home to beaches, luxury hotels, casinos and golf courses — used to be a Japanese camp for British and Australian prisoners-of-war during World War II. Many Singaporean Chinese who were suspected of acting against Japan were also executed there. The island was renamed Sentosa — Malay for \"peace and tranquility\" — in 1970, following a competition to come up with a new moniker. Its previous name was Pulau Belakang Mati, meaning \"Island After Death.\"The island earned the name because of its reputation as a rendezvous point for pirates during the 18th and 19th centuries. Sentosa is midway between China and India, so the island was an ideal trading port for the British. However, pirates would take advantage of cargo ships docked on its coast, making the area notoriously dangerous, according to the BBC.White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders tweeted the location of the summit  Tuesday. \"We thank our great Singaporean hosts for their hospitality,\" she added.Trump and Kim’s summit is scheduled to start Tuesday at 9 a.m. local time (9 p.m. ET Monday), after it was thrown into uncertainty when Trump abruptly canceled it, before negotiations put it back on track.A U.S. advance team was spotted at the Capella Hotel last week meeting with North Korean officials to prepare for the summit.Workers were putting a fresh coat of paint on the façade Tuesday evening.

(June 11)\n    APSINGAPORE — As the spotlight lands on this tiny nation of 5.5 million ahead of the historic summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, many Singaporeans seemed to be taking the massive operation in stride.On Monday, crowds of journalists and curious locals gathered around the hotels where Trump and Kim are staying, while most other Singaporeans went about their daily routines — going to and from work, shopping and jogging past security checkpoints and police stationed with shotguns and rifles.Some locals expressed a sense of pride about their city-state being able to pull off such a major event.“I think people here are happy about the summit,” said Zainudin Deen, a financial consultant who was walking nearby the Shangri-La Hotel where Trump and his entourage are staying. “As the host nation, we’re proud. We were able to set up the security for this with short notice.”More: Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un to meet alone at Singapore summitMore: Potty prep: North Korea's Kim Jong Un brings his own toilet to SingaporeMore: Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un arrive in Singapore for nuclear summitAt the nearby St. Regis hotel, where Kim Jong Un and his delegation are staying, a growing crowd formed during the evening as word got around that the North Korean leader would be coming out to go on a nighttime mini-city tour of Singapore.Alan Heng, 55, hung around with his brother near the hotel, hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive North Korean leader while enjoying the electric atmosphere.“Everybody is excited,” he said. “It’s a big international event, and it’s putting Singapore in the spotlight. There are small inconveniences, but it’s worth it.”Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shared that sentiment, saying Sunday that the $15 million  cost to the host country was money well spent.\"It's our contribution to an international endeavor which is in our profound interest,\" Lee told reporters Sunday at the international media center the city-state set up to accommodate the more than 2,500 journalists covering the event.Lee said that about half the cost is going to security.\"It is a cost we are willing to pay,\" Lee said. \"(The summit) gives us publicity. The fact that we have been chosen as the site of the meeting — we did not ask for it, but we were asked and we agreed — says something about Singapore's relations with the parties, with America, with North Korea, also our standing in the international community.\" Singapore is paying the bill for Kim and the North Korean delegation, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told the BBC on Monday.Of course, there have been efforts to cash in on the summit. The Singapore Mint unveiled three commemorative coins, in gold, silver and nickel, featuring clasped hands under the North Korean and American flags on the front and the inscription “World Peace” on the reverse.Local businesses have been getting in on the act as well: Several restaurants spotted around town were offering summit-related promotions. The Royal Plaza on Scotts, a hotel near the Shangri-La where Trump is staying,  was selling a Trump-Kim burger featuring kimchi, the spicy fermented dish that is a staple of Korean food.And the Trump and Kim impersonators who captured media attention at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February turned up in Singapore for an event where fans could take selfies with them for a price.Still, some locals took a bigger-picture perspective on Singapore’s role in the historic summit.“It’s very great to host such a big event,” said D.M. Lim, an office administrator who stopped to join the crowd outside St. Regis hotel on her way home from work. “It’s good for Singapore, but the main point is, maybe we can help the two sides make peace, and that would be great for the world.”  ","header":"At the center of the North Korean summit spotlight, tiny Singapore beams with pride","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:12:28.673Z"},"time":"2:58 AM"}

He also said North Korea 'loomed large' during multi-national security talks in Singapore. (June 4)\n    APWASHINGTON — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's wish list for his  meeting Tuesday with President Trump at a resort in Singapore could shed light on the prospects for the summit. Trump in the past promised \"great things\" for North Korea if it dismantles its nuclear program. On Friday, after meeting with the North's Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol, the president appeared to tamp down expectations for next week's meeting, calling it \"a get-to-know-you kind of a situation,\" and \"a process\" that starts with building relationships.Trump said the U.S. and North Korea may agree in Singapore to formally end the Korean War, which has been frozen with an armistice agreement since 1953. He said he no longer wants to speak of \"maximum pressure\" on North Korea, and said South Korea, Japan and China are expected to provide economic assistance to the North if the summit goes well. He implied that U.S. sanctions could be lifted at a later point, which would allow business relations between the North and the United States for the first time. But he is likely to hear from Kim that the North seeks more than a deal on nuclear weapons or a peace treaty. Here's what Kim wants:More: No one leaves early, and 4 other key things for a successful Trump-North Korea summitMore: Donald Trump: June 12 meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un back onMore: North Korea's isolation crumbling as Trump abandons 'maximum pressure' campaignKim's spokesman said last month that North Korea is not interested in giving up its nuclear program without a corresponding change in the U.S. military posture.North Korea is not interested in \"unilateral nuclear abandonment,\" Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement, according to North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). He accused the White House and State Department of attempting to turn North Korea into another Libya by insisting on \"abandoning nuclear weapons first, compensating afterward.\"Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi relinquished his nuclear weapons development program in return for normalized relations with the United States, but he was deposed in a rebellion supported by NATO.North Korea's agreements and statements indicate Kim wants normalized relations with the United States. “An end to U.S. enmity remains Kim Jong Un’s aim just as it was his grandfather’s and father’s for the past 30 years,” said Leon Sigal, author of Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North Korea.Kim may be willing to denuclearize and even take steps to disarm if Trump commits to end hostile relations with North Korea and takes action to show the United States means it, Sigal wrote in March in 38 North, an independent online journal that provides analysis of North Korea.A problem for U.S. leaders has been that North Korea's totalitarian government is so cruel to its people and aggressive toward its neighbors that allowing normal trade would be politically unappetizing. In his New Year's speech, Kim said his poor country was ready to shift to economic development.Past negotiations also focused on economic benefits. The United States offered to arrange energy assistance from petroleum producers, build two light-water nuclear reactors that would be difficult to use for producing weapons, provide food assistance and lift sanctions.April's meeting of the rival Korean leaders ended with South Korean President Moon Jae-in's promise to connect and modernize railroad lines and roads.To keep that pledge, the South would need waivers from United Nations Security Council sanctions on North Korea, something Trump appears ready to agree to provide to the South, China and Japan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the United States would not provide any benefits until the North completely dismantled its nuclear program.More: Donald Trump, North Korea's Kim Jong Un will likely save the details for after the summitMore: Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un: Still fighting the Korean WarMore: Kim Jong Un's fires top military leaders: What does it mean?North Korea has made agreements while still advancing its nuclear program and can be expected to continue doing the same, said Richard Fisher, a Korea and China analyst at the International Assessment and Strategy Center.While Kim negotiates with Trump, his engineers are probably perfecting a weapon that can strike the U.S. mainland, Fisher said.\"They tested two ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) capable of reaching the United States,\" Fisher said. \"They have not yet demonstrated that the missile could carry a warhead that would survive re-entry with some level of accuracy. I’m sure they’re working day and night to develop a viable warhead.\"Kim's negotiations with Trump and Moon \"allowed this megalomaniac leader to seem reasonable on the world stage,\" and furthers a shared North Korean and Chinese goal to reduce U.S. influence in northeast Asia, Fisher said.\"Prior to these negotiations, Kim Jong Un was seen as a missile-rattling rocket boy threat to the world. (Chinese President Xi Jinping) couldn’t embrace him,\" Fisher said. \"Now that the negotiations have gone as far as they have, Xi can embrace this young leader and solidify their already very close cooperation.\"Other leaders have too. Russia has invited Kim to a conference in Vladivostok in September, and KCNA announced Sunday that Syrian President Bashar Assad will be the first head of state to visit Kim in Pyongyang.Kim and China seek an end to the U.S. military presence in South Korea, Fisher said. \"They want the Americans off the Korean Peninsula. They want full range and freedom to intimidate South Korea even more and to isolate Japan,\" he said. \"It's all part of a larger goal of forcing American power back to Hawaii and California.\"","header":"Here's Kim Jong Un's wish list for the Singapore summit with President Trump","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:13:16.411Z"},"time":"2:58 AM"}

Here's a look at what we can expect in the coming months.\n    USA TODAYI supported President Trump’s decision to meet with Kim Jong Un, the dictator of North Korea. From my own experience in negotiating with the North Koreans, I know that their leaders believe only they can make consequential decisions for their country. This makes sense since North Korea lacks a free press, an effective legislature and any sense of \"we the people.\" Although the United States is a democracy, President Trump has said that he feels that only he makes decisions for our country. I thought, then, that perhaps these two leaders might develop a framework that would authorize negotiating teams to move forward with a plan to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and ballistic missiles in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way.More: Don't let Donald Trump erase Otto Warmbier from the Singapore summit with Kim Jong UnMore: Donald Trump's off-the-cuff summit with Kim Jong Un might succeed. Here's why.Instead, the Singapore summit wasn’t much more than bluster and balloons. It was a celebratory summit where Kim publicly received the respect and recognition he and his predecessors have long sought, and Trump didn’t get much more than a vague promise. Optics were arranged to portray Kim as the equal of a U.S. president. Flags of both countries were hung side-by-side, photo ops were arranged, and the leaders signed an official statement that was far weaker than at least three previous documents signed by North Korea in years past.Unlike the agreements negotiated in 1992, 1994 and 2005, Tuesday’s joint statement includes no verification requirements or framework to guide negotiations.To further complicate matters, President Trump announced that the United States would cease joint military exercises with South Korea and indicated that he hopes to withdraw all U.S. troops from the peninsula — removing from the start an important tool in our diplomatic toolbox, in this case deterrence of the North’s large conventional military.To make matters worse, the president used North Korea’s talking points, calling the exercises \"war games\" and \"provocative\" when they are defensive in nature. And, apparently, the announcement was made without South Korea’s knowledge.This announcement underscores the president’s predilection to act bilaterally and on his own without regard to alliances and partners. He appears to have forgotten about our unified command with the Republic of Korea, which serves our security as well as South Korea’s, and he doesn’t seem to understand that any potential agreement would be durable only if South Korea, Japan, China and Russia are on board.More: Donald Trump should think again before North Korea summit in SingaporePOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, mediaKim no doubt returned home to cheering crowds, organized by his government, heralding him as a great leader who successfully made the United States treat North Korea as an equal. President Trump, too, has turned on the media machine, organizing a political campaign-like rally to herald his summit. It would be better for everyone if these leaders and their teams simply got down to work.I hope the much-hyped personal touches of the summit lead to a personal best in peacemaking for each leader and, more important, for our countries, our partners and the world.To get there, however, will take more than a vague summit statement. It will take hard work, a robust and capable team, technical detail, patience and persistence. It will demand verification and monitoring. It will require the engagement of all our allies and partners — along with the U.S. Congress and the American people. The real celebration will be years down the road, if at all.Nonetheless, dialogue and diplomacy are certainly a better path than fire and fury.Wendy R.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7a79416dba1b08b58bf747"},"url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-kim-summit.html","content":"By THE NEW YORK TIMESJUNE 12, 2018\nPresident Trump spoke about his agreement with Kim Jong-un for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and his plans to invite the North Korean leader to the White House.This live briefing has ended. See our main story on the North Korea summit here.President Trump, after a daylong historic summit with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un on Tuesday, announced plans to suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula and said he expected Mr. Kim to move “very quickly” to dismantle his country’s nuclear arsenal.The summit meeting was the first of its kind between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader, and it ended in a joint statement that opened the door to ending seven decades of hostility between the two countries.Mr. Trump said at a news conference that the United States would stop “the war games,” in what appeared to be a concession to the North. He said the exercises were expensive and “very provocative,” though both the Pentagon and South Korean military were caught off guard by the announcement.In a joint statement after the leaders’ first face-to-face meeting, the United States “committed to provide security guarantees” to the North. In exchange, Mr. Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But Mr. Trump said economic sanctions against North Korea would remain in place.Here’s what happened:• The two leaders first met privately for less than an hour in a one-on-one session with interpreters present, before breaking off for a larger meeting and then a working lunch with aides.Advertisement• The leaders signed their joint statement, in which the United States committed to providing guarantees of security to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization.• “We had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,” Mr. Kim said as he and Mr. Trump signed the joint statement, adding, “The world will see a major change.”Mr. Trump was similarly optimistic saying, “We are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world.”• Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim departed Singapore hours after their meeting. See photos from the summit.In the joint statement, Mr. Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea. Mr. Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”But the statement was short on details and did not lay out potential next steps or a timetable. It was not immediately released to reporters, but was legible in a photo of Mr. Trump holding it up at the ceremony.The statement said the two nations would hold “follow-on negotiations” led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a high-level North Korean official “at the earliest possible date, to implement the outcomes” of the summit meeting.AdvertisementThe statement also said the two nations would “join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime” on the divided Korean Peninsula, meaning talks to reduce military tensions that could eventually lead to a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War.During a meeting in Singapore, Donald Trump presented Kim Jong-un with a short video depicting the prosperity that could come with peace. James Poniewozik, The Times’s chief television critic, tells us the video’s cartoonish, idealized aesthetic was no accident.Mr. Trump presented Mr. Kim with a short video depicting the prosperity that could come with peace. The video, which was shown to journalists before Mr. Trump’s news conference, was a hyperbolic movie-trailer-style montage of many, many images, both positive and dire.Among them: airplanes, bridges, skyscrapers, smiling children, American armaments, missile launches, postwar devastation, high-speed trains, a basketball player dunking a ball and horses running through water.“There comes a time when only a few are called upon to make a difference, but the question is: What difference will the few make?” intones a narrator in the English-language version of the video.“The past doesn’t have to be the future. Out of the darkness can come the light.”American and South Korean officials were surprised by Mr. Trump’s plans to end “war games” on the Korean Peninsula. Lt. Col. Jennifer Lovett, a United States military spokeswoman in South Korea, said in an email that the American command there “has received no updated guidance on execution or cessation of training exercises — to include this fall’s schedule Ulchi Freedom Guardian.”“We will continue with our current military posture until we receive updated guidance from the Department of Defense,” she added.Mr. Trump’s statement that he was suspending joint military exercises with South Korea also stunned many South Koreans. The annual exercises have been an integral part of the alliance with the United States that forms the bulwark of South Korea’s defenses against the North.Mr. Trump’s pronouncement raised fears that Washington was making concessions before North Korea had actually dismantled its nuclear weapons.AdvertisementThe South Korean Defense Ministry issued a curt statement saying that it was trying to determine Mr. Trump’s intentions.Despite the uncertainty, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea celebrated the meeting’s outcome, calling it “a historic event that has helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on earth.”“I pay my high compliments for the courage and determination of the two leaders, President Trump and Chairman Kim, not to settle for that outdated and familiar reality but to take a daring step toward change,” Mr. Moon said.“Once again, I would like to pay my respects to President Trump, who achieved a feat that no one else has ever delivered,” he said.At the end of their meeting, Mr. Kim pledged to destroy a missile-engine testing site, Mr. Trump told reporters, in what he characterized as a last-minute decision that was not included in the joint agreement.“I got that after we signed the agreement,” Mr. Trump said of the concession. “I said, ‘Do me a favor; we’ve got this missile-engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat.’ It’s incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you.”The death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was detained in North Korea, helped precipitate the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the president said on Tuesday at a post-summit meeting news conference.“I think without Otto this would not have happened,” Mr. Trump said. “Otto was someone who did not die in vain.”AdvertisementMr. Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea in 2016. He was repatriated to the United States in a coma after 17 months in detention and then died.“The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim,” Mr. Trump said in a statement at the time of Mr. Warmbier’s death.Mr. Trump, who was a developer before he became president, focused on one particular economic prospect for North Korea: real estate.“As an example, they have great beaches,” he said during a news conference after his meeting with Mr. Kim. “You see that whenever they’re exploding their cannons into the ocean. I said, ‘Boy, look at that view. Wouldn’t that make a great condo?’”“You could have the best hotels in the world right there,” Mr. Trump continued. “Think of it from a real estate perspective. You have South Korea, you have China and they own the land in the middle. How bad is that, right? It’s great.”For Americans who never got to bury loved ones killed in the Korean War, the summit meeting offered new hope.The joint statement signed by both leaders said their two countries were committed to recovering and repatriating the remains of soldiers who were designated captured or missing at the end of the conflict in 1953.Of the 82,000 American service members still missing from the wars of the past century, 7,702 are from the Korean War, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is responsible for recovering missing personnel from around the world.AdvertisementAn estimated 120,000 South Korean troops and police officers are also unaccounted for in the Korean War.Mr. Trump, in his post-meeting news conference, said he had received “countless calls and letters” from family members asking him to discuss the issue with Mr. Kim.“The remains will be coming back,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re going to start that process immediately.”China welcomed the news from Singapore and patted itself on the back.“I think nobody can doubt the extremely unique and important role China has played,” said Wang Yi, the foreign minister.Mr. Wang may have been so pleased because of Mr. Trump’s decision to suspend military exercises on the Korean Peninsula.China floated that idea last year, suggesting that the North suspend its weapons program in exchange for an end to American military exercises.Chinese experts on North Korea, however, were underwhelmed by the summit meeting’s outcome.“Well below my expectation,” Cheng Xiaohe of Renmin University said of the joint statement. “Full of empty talk that has already been said before. So far Trump has failed to prove himself a dealmaker.”Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized the president’s seemingly cozy relationship with North Korea and said the declaration signed by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was “very light on details” in a statement hours after the meetingAdvertisement“Talking to dictators is one thing; embracing them is another,” Mr. Biden said. While Mr. Trump gained little from the meeting, the North Koreans had much to gain, he said.Mr. Biden urged the president to remember the “horrendous human rights abuses North Korean leaders perpetrate against their own people” and called Mr. Trump’s claim that preparation for the meeting was unimportant “inexcusable and irresponsible.”“North Korea gained the legitimacy of a meeting with the American president; the easing of the international economic and sanctions pressure, carefully built over the last two administrations; and the suspension of our military readiness exercises with South Korea — a decision apparently made without consulting our ally,” Mr. Biden said in his statement.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim departed Singapore just hours after their meeting. Mr. Trump flew out ahead of schedule, leaving just before 6 p.m. local time on Tuesday. He had initially planned to leave early Wednesday, but said his plans had changed.“There was nothing more we could have done. We had the agreement done,” Mr. Trump said when speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the flight, according to pool reports.“I think he wants to get it done,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kim’s willingness to denuclearize, adding that he trusted the North Korean leader.When asked how he planned to verify that North Korea would follow through on these promises, Mr. Trump provided little detail.“We’re going to have to check it, and we will check it,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ll check it very strongly.”AdvertisementPresident Trump’s plane touched down in Guam early Wednesday to refuel.Mr. Kim departed Singapore around 11 p.m. on an Air China flight, according to Singapore’s Ministry of Communications and Information. The ministry shared photos of a smiling Mr. Kim shaking hands with Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore’s minister of foreign affairs.Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim filed into a working lunch with their expanded entourages, and hamburgers were not on the menu.Mr. Trump, you may remember, famously said early in his campaign that he was willing to sit down with Mr. Kim and perhaps have a hamburger with him.Instead, their first meal together at the Capella on Sentosa Island in Singapore included beef short rib confit, Korean stuffed cucumber and sweet and sour crispy pork with Yangzhou fried rice. According to the menu released by the White House, dessert included a dark chocolate tartlet ganache — perhaps in honor of Mr. Trump’s preference for chocolate cake. The White House did not indicate whether it had been flown over from Mar-a-Lago. When Mr. Trump played host to President Xi Jinping of China, he boasted about serving “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen.”In deference to Mr. Kim, there was also another Korean dish, Daegu jorim, described as soy braised cod fish with radish and Asian vegetables.Reporting was contributed by Russell Goldman from Hong Kong, Mark Landler and Motoko Rich from Singapore, Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea, Richard Pérez-Peña and Michael Wolgelenter from London, Eric Schmitt from Washington, Megan Specia from New York and Jose A.

A potentially important event. The meaning of it is still to be seen. Apparently, the U.S. has agreed to suspension of exercises, which isn't as much of a giveaway as it seems. Asking for de-nuclearization while engaging in wargames at their border is a tough sell. Holding back on that this long was a good move. If N.K. shows ill will, it will be easier to resume military exercises. Sanctions remain. The test now is whether N.K. is serious. Trump has removed objections without compromising the main things. Now we must wait to see if Kim is not playing games. As much as legitimacy for the N. Korean gov't this action also brings them out of the shadows. Again, we will see if the N. Koreans are serious. If they aren't it will be on them, not us, not Trump. This could even work against China. Who knows? I'm willing to see what happens and not bash Trump in knee-jerk fashion. You can't make this up.  Key quotes - the remarks about the condo prospects. Always an angle, Donnie J.  Seriously?  When you think about it, that's his orientation to everything. Not surprising, really. He should just go live there and never come back.  It's 'his peeps' he is developing, lately - a real band of bro's - Donnie and the World Crime Mob with Zhynah, Pootin, and lil' Kim...  'World Toasted', their upcoming No. 1 hit...I suspect this will diminish America’s clout in the region, and it’s the second time in less than a week we sold out our allies. North Korea will likely pull out at the last minute, benefitting from easing sanctions while preserving nuclear capability (it wouldn’t be the first time North Korea reneged).  Japan and South Korea will likely no longer depend on us for protection, and to hedge their bets, they may directly reach out to North Korea and China to make their own agreements.Trump should have prepared.With regard to selling out our allies, they were already selling us out. Trump merely retook the momentum. The concerns regarding S. Korean and Japanese security would be valid if the President had not worked to regain momentum. I wish folks would stop attacking everything about this President and not put me in the position of defending him. Attack the substance. Here we really don't know how things will play out. “Stick with me, Kim baby, and you’ll be driving Cadillacs.”If Trump wasn’t afflicted with those nasty bone spurs of his, he could have gone to Vietnam and made a 5-Star hotel out of the Hanoi Hilton and changed the course of history.  It can’t get any easier than that.  Just like the kids game of Monopoly - not much thinking, roll the dice, hope you land on the right spot, buy more hotels till you get tired of winning.Sure, North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons.I've got a bridge that I'd like to sell to President Trump.Trump would have done better not to mention Otto Warmbier, who was detained, tortured and died at the hands of the North Koreans.  This bogus agreement is bad enough without reminding us of the cruelty and ruthlessness of the dictator he was playing pals with.It was a mighty fine show, The Kardashians could have not done much better. Well, maybe they could. This made for Fox News summit is as phony as everything else about Trump.\" The Presidential Apprentice: Dictator Summer \".  A VERY special episode.Trump made a “promise” - Big deal!  Two dictators met.  Both liars. What’s new?Sure sounds like an appeasement concession to Kim.Trump is a fascist.  I'm sure the CIA and FBI have had secret meeting in case this does not end well.  And it won't.....for anyone.Did the video included a pitch for Trump Hotel in Pyongyang, or a Trump resort in the mountains?I have a bad feeling about this episode of OUR DAILY REALITY SHOW.Maybe because the the 2 who signed this meaningless agreement are lying dirt bags with hidden agenda's, one is a brutal but clever Dictator and the other is a grifter conman who would sell his mother for a nickel.Extra, Extra, Trump sells out South Korea!! Read all about it. Another Republican Victory!Oh wait- this is a Trump deal. It may or may not be real. Only Kelly Conway knows. Trump has accomplished 4 significant things:1.  Demonstrate to the world that there is a payoff for developing the capability of hitting the United States with nuclear weapons, never mind if there is any possibility of actually using them without committing suicide.  The \"crisis\" thus created in the U.S. will lead to a shower of free goodies.  Iran is no doubt taking notes.2.  He has exchanged for a vague promise by NK to give up nuclear weapons which are militarily worthless because they are not usable for offensive strikes (as every nuclear power already knows) for giving NK for free a specific promise by the U.S. to eliminate its most important real military deterrent against it, namely maintaining battle-ready troops on the Korean peninsula.  The deterrent value of 30,000 U.S. troops in SK is much if they are not allowed to maintain combat readiness by performing joint exercises with SK troops.3.  He has brought Kim one important step closer to his overarching goal of dominating the Korean peninsula through conventional military means.4.  He has pleased China, which has long wanted American forces removed from the Korean peninsula, or the next best thing, rendered unprepared for combat.    Reasonable concerns are expressed here, but let's keep it all in perspective. The S. Koreans have long wanted to reunite with the North. President Moon is part of that school of thought. The S. Korean President was already working around the U.S. and undermining our efforts. There is no stomach in S. Korea's admin to take a hard line with Kim. Trump's action may help S. Koreans decide what they actually want. Trump may have done more to bring down the N. Korean gov't by engaging it. Kim has thrived in a hermit kingdom, but once in the real world he may find coping a lot harder. As far as nukes are concerned, Trump is obstructing nuclear proliferation--a laudable goal. Regarding China, if Korea is drawn closer to the U.S., then it will be that much further from China--a future competitor. The U.S. is unilaterally dropping South Korea’s largest assurance of peace on the peninsula. Without warning. Do you want a nuclear armed South Korea? Because, Mr. Trump, this is how you get one. One con man meets another.Classic.Trump: unprepared in 2016, unprepared in 2018.What did 18 months of presidency teach Trump? Nothing. Bad teachers? No, bad student.If I was in Tokyo or Taipei, I would be seriously nervous.  Based on trumps actions toward our enemies vs our allies, it seems pretty clear that Russia, China, and NK coordinated this dog and pony show for maximum effect. Alienating friends and dropping military readiness in S Korea is something all three of our new best friends would welcome.So, what's Trump's NEXT move with the military going to be?   Training to invade Canada?  It's shocking that a president would just fling away such a vital aspect of our defense posture as military training exercises with our ally.  What kind of foreign policy is this?  Breaking up with long term democratic allies and going all kissy-kissy with despotic and murderous adversaries?  Don't cry for me, America!  For I've elected Trump as my Loathsome Leader. Trump totally ignored the issue of \"human rights\" in NK, which is and always has been an American value. Kim Jung Un assassinated his half brother and uncle. He has been recommended in a report by a UN commission in 2014  for crimes against humanity and was recommended for accountability for these crimes by the International Criminal Court. But Trump said he purposely didn’t bring it up. But Trump closed Cuba to Americans due to \"human rights\" issues after Obama had opened it up in order to allow US business opportunities to compete with Russian influence. So now Russia is investing in Cuba and has a geopolitical advantage. The point is......\"human rights\" is really not important to Trump.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/world/americas/cuba-trump.htmlIn addition, Otto Warmbier's parents were on CNN today, recounting the horror of having their son returned to them as a deaf and blind vegetable. \"I think about Otto every day,\" his mother said, \"I think about Otto every minute of every day.\" The idea of Trump inviting his new pal to the White House is sickening. The only reason this meeting took place is because putin wanted it to.DJT works for putin not the American people, so it’s easy to understand his disdain for the G7 but he meets with one communist dictator (Un)and proposes that another (putin) should be readmitted to the G7.His actions are treasonous and his very words are not close to believeable! DJT has no interest in the well being of this nation and its peopleI will support any and all candidates that seek his removal from office.Readers shared their thoughts on this article.The comments section is closed.

They are protecting against a literal info dump.“The leader’s excretions contain information about his health status so they can’t be left behind,” Lee Yun-keol explained.Similar travel considerations are reportedly made whenever the North Korean leader conducts on-site inspections of military bases and state-run factories across the country.In fact, according to the South Korean news agency, Daily NK, there is a customised bathroom built into Kim’s convoy of vehicles at all times.“The restrooms are not only in Kim Jong Un’s personal train but whatever small or midsize cars he is traveling with and even in special vehicles that are designed for mountainous terrain or snow,” a source in South Pyongan Provincefamiliar with Kim’s Escort Command told the DailyNK in 2015. “There are multiple vehicles within the convoy so that people cannot tell which one he is in, and there is a separate car that acts as his restroom.”So, in this respect at least, it seems this historic summit is no different than Kim’s other excursions.He simply always uses a personal, highly guarded toilet in “loo” of public facilities. Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that “the nation’s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7a79dc6dba1b08b58bfe55"},"url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/06/american-fox-korean-tortoise-met-singapore/","content":"By Owei LakemfaWHEN United States, US, President Donald Trump arrived the Sentosa Island of Singapore, he appeared psychologically unprepared for  his June 12, historic summit with the Democratic   Peoples’ Republic of Korean, North Korean President  Kim Jong- un. Two days before the summit, he had a verbal brawl at the G7 Summit with some of America’s closest allies; the trusting  but miffed Germans, the  exasperated French and traditional ally,  Canada.An angry Trump refused to sign the G7 Communique and accused Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of stabbing America in the back. In turn, the  countries accused America of insulting them.  As the meeting with Jong-un  got underway, the question was if brother Canada is beginning to find the Americans  unreliable, is it the North Koreans who would trust them?Following  his fight with trusted allies, Trump arrived Singapore, a man that appeared isolated.In  contrast, Jong-un  took strolls with Singaporean officials,  appeared at ease and enjoying  the international focus on him and his country. It was a sharp contrast; here is the leader  of the ‘Free World’ looking isolated and the leader of  North Korea, a country that has faced isolation for 68 years, appearing friendly, free and relaxed.For North Korea, the meeting was a good public relations and it had every reason to appear confident. Its food crises, is over, its possession of nuclear weapons, meant that Trump cannot  afford to display the kind of arrogance he had exhibited to the Canadian and German leaders. Also, for the first time in nearly 70 years, the government in South Korea was not anti-North, wants peace and reconciliation and is keen to ensure that its territory will not be used as a theatre of war.The North and South Korea conflicts are a  Cold War product. Both sides went to war on June 25, 1950. On the North Korean side were China and  the defunct Soviet Union, on the South Korean side were  21 countries including Great Britain with the US providing 90 per cent of the foreign troops under the United Nations flag.It was a stalemate, and by the time the ceasefire agreement was signed in July, 1953, over five million people had lost their lives. The US alone lost almost 40,000  troops  with over 100,000 injured. Technically, the war has  not ended and it was only in April, 2018 that Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to sign a treaty formally ending the war, by the end of the year.It is clear that if the US has the capability and military strength, it would be dictating and not holding a meeting with Jong-un; but  North Korea with its nuclear weapons has become like a needle which the rotund American cock, cannot swallow.The meeting itself was more of drama than substance. President Trump said his country is committed to providing  security guarantees for North Korea, a promissory note which the North Koreans know is not cashable. In return,  Jong-un “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The same commitment he had made to the South Korean President and to the world 46 days earlier.The twosome signed a vague four-point communique in which both sides committed themselves  to establishing  new  relations for peace and prosperity. They also agreed to  build “a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.” The third point was a reiteration of North Korea’s commitment “to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The last,  was  a  commitment to  recovering the remains of Prisoners Of War  and those Missing In Action and  the immediate repatriation of those already identified.Both sides also  agreed  to hold follow-up negotiations, led by the American  Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and a high-level North Korean  official. The timeframe for this is an equally vague “earliest possible date” to implement the outcomes of the  summit.President Trump hailed the vague agreement as “comprehensive.” While Jong-un returned home apparently satisfied that his country had exacted some commitments from the US and shown itself to the world that contrary to widely held beliefs, it is not a warmongering state,  President Trump  addressed a press conference seeking to provide some flesh to the bony agreement and provide some details.He said the US would stop its military exercises with South Korea because: “We will be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, it is very provocative.”He is also looking forward to bringing the 32,000 American troops home. Both promises, apart from being confidence-building measures, are also economically sensible.  The rising annual cost of maintaining American troops in South Korea as at 2016, was $1.1 billion. Although the South Koreans pick up about half the bill, Trump has been complaining about it being a financial burden to cash strapped US. Additionally, the South Koreans spend $10 billion annually to provide support personnel services to the American military. It also makes huge arms purchases from the Americans which in the last 10 years came to over $32 billion. The South Koreans would rather want to spend such huge resources developing their country.America would certainly want to reduce the cost of maintaining foreign bases in countries like Germany, Japan, Qatar, Djibouti, Australia, Bahrain,  Kenya, Colombia,  and Bulgaria.The Trump promise of America gradually easing sanctions will be sweet to North Korean ears, but I am not sure how much store they can  put in another Trump promise to assist in the massive  development of  their  country, when America itself needs cash. As  at May, 2018,  the US official debt was $21.15 trillion  while its former Comptroller-General  (Director of American Government Accountability Office), Mr. David Walker says in reality, the American debt exceeds $65 trillion.While Trump appears anxious  to negotiate a nuclear deal with North Korea, he is not hesitating in smashing  the Iranian Nuclear deal with the United Nations because he knows  the former has a stockpile of nuclear weapons while he believes the Iranians can be stopped from developing  nuclear weapons.China should be happy about the easing of tension in the Korean Peninsula, stoppage of war games   and the possibility of America drastically reducing its troops there. But it should realise that the Americans may shift attention to the disputed South China Sea.If peace were to return, the immediate winners would be the two Koreas who will spend less on arms, work towards reconciliation and if possible, unite. But let me conclude by stating that the Talks are not irreversible especially if they are tailored primarily to achieve unilateral North Korean denuclearization. The North Koreans will not entrust their security and lives in the hands of the Americans.Also in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that “the nation’s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7a7a326dba1b08b58c022f"},"url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/06/nobel-offing-trump-kim-jong-un/","content":"Could their historic Singapore summit earn Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un a Nobel Peace Prize?Maybe, but it’s still early days, say experts.The US president and the North Korean leader on Tuesday signed an agreement which, while short on details, reaffirmed Pyongyang’s commitment to the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula”.Some commentators and politicians have suggested the pair be awarded a Nobel for their efforts.But experts say the prestigious prize — at least for now — may remain elusive for the duo.Timing and personalities count against both leaders, they say.Trump has given a seismic shock to international diplomacy by, among other things, pulling the US out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran, while Kim is guilty of numerous human rights violations.And then there is the question of whether their process bears fruit. The diplomacy of disarmament is invariably risk-laden, complex and long.“It’s too early,” Asle Sveen, a historian who specialises in the Nobel prize, said of the prospects for a Kim-Trump award.“But if (the agreement) were to lead to real disarmament on the Korean peninsula, it would be very difficult to not award them the prize. It would be a bizarre situation, but that’s happened in the past, that people with a pretty violent past have received the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Even before the Singapore summit, several people, including South Korean President Moon Jae-in, former US president Jimmy Carter and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, suggested Trump could deserve the Nobel.One fake Nobel Peace Prize nomination for Trump has already been invalidated after a case of identity fraud was uncovered earlier this year. But 18 Republicans have nominated him for 2019 in recognition of “his tireless work to bring peace to our world.”Ten years after it awarded the Peace Prize to the newly-elected Barack Obama in a move that was widely mocked as being premature, the Nobel committee does not want to repeat past mistakes.And in 2000, the Nobel was awarded to then South Korean president Kim Dae-jung for his reconciliation efforts with the North, which turned out to be little more than “a public relations campaign,” said Henrik Urdal, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (Prio).“I think they’ll probably wait to see some pretty significant results before giving another prize in that direction,” Urdal said.Dan Smith, the head of Stockholm peace research institute SIPRI, agreed the Nobel would be premature.“Today’s agreement is a good first step but the journey is long and complicated. Other things President Trump has done — most notably withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, which is crucial for global security, and destabilising the Iran nuclear deal, which is crucial for Middle East regional stability — are much less positive for peace.”– ‘Blood on their hands’ –\nIf real progress were to be made on the Korean peninsula, the Nobel committee would find itself in a bit of a dilemma, given the track record of the two main actors.“Many of those who have received the Peace Prize have had quite a bit of blood on their hands,” noted Urdal.“The question is whether they did enough good that it washes out the blood. Neither Trump nor Kim Jong Un have done enough this year to win the prize.”Geir Lundestad, who served as the influential secretary of the Nobel committee between 1990 and 2014, used to say that the “Nobel is not a prize for saints.”“But you don’t have to push this logic to the extreme either,” he said on Tuesday.He hailed the Singapore summit but expressed scepticism about the possibility of a Nobel at this stage.“These two people have a lot of baggage: Kim is one of the worst dictators in the world and Donald Trump is in the process of tearing down the political and economic structures that the US set up after 1945 and that have benefitted everyone,” he said.Urdal meanwhile pointed to the paradoxes in Trump’s diplomacy.“The thing that damages Trump’s chances the most is that he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal,” Urdal said.“At the same that he’s choosing the path of peace on the Korean peninsula, he’s stoking a conflict in the Middle East and is putting an entire region in danger.”Peter Wallensteen, a Swedish professor specialised in international relations, said South Korean President Moon Jae-in deserved to be included if ever a prize were awarded for peace in Korea.“Actually, Moon might be the one that deserves this the most, but that would be a slap against Trump!”AFPAlso in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that “the nation’s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

Thank you to Kim Jong Un,” Trump wrote on Twitter.A White House statement earlier said: “We are encouraged by North Korea’s actions and the momentum for\npositive change.”The White House in a statement said a U.S. military transport plane flew to an airfield in North Korea’s northeastern city of Wonsan to bring the remains to Osan air base in South Korea.Soldiers in dress uniforms with white gloves were seen slowly carrying 55 small cases covered with the blue-and-white U.N. insignia, placing them one by one into silver vans waiting on the tarmac in Osan.Straight-backed officers looked on next to the flags of the United States, South Korea and the UN.A formal repatriation ceremony would be held at Osan on Wednesday, the White House said.The remains would then be flown to Hawaii for further processing under the U.S. Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the UN Command said in a statement.The transfer of the remains coincided with the 65th anniversary of the 1953 armistice that ended fighting between North Korean and Chinese forces on one side and South Korean and U.S.-led forces under the UN Command on the other.The two Koreas are technically still at war because a peace treaty was never signed.Kim paid tribute to the North’s Korean War “martyrs” and to Chinese soldiers killed in the conflict, state media said.More than 7,700 U.S. troops who fought in the Korean War remain unaccounted for, with about 5,300 of those lost in what is now North Korea.The pledge to transfer war remains was seen as a goodwill gesture by Kim at the June summit and, while it has taken longer than some U.S. officials had hoped, the handover will rekindle hopes for progress in\nnuclear talks.Kim committed in a broad summit statement to work toward denuclearization but Pyongyang has offered no\ndetails.South Korea welcomed the return of the remains, calling it “meaningful progress that could contribute to fostering trust” between Pyongyang and Washington.The two Koreas agreed to hold general-level military talks on Tuesday to discuss ways to implement their own summit in April in which they vowed to defuse tensions, Seoul’s defence ministry said on Friday.South Korea also said it plans to cut the number of troops from 618,000 to 500,000 by 2020 and the number of generals from 436 to 360 as part of military reforms.The plan comes amid a thaw in relations between the two Koreas and days after the South pledged to reduce guard posts and equipment along the demilitarized zone on its border with the North.It would spend 270.7 trillion won (241.8 billion dollars) on the reforms from 2019 to 2023, which translates to a 7.5 per cent rise in its annual defence budget, the ministry said in a statement.Pyongyang has renewed calls for a declaration of the end of the Korean War, calling it the “first process for peace” and an important way Washington can add heft to security guarantees it has pledged in return for North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons.The U.S. State Department says Washington is committed to building a peace mechanism to replace the armistice when North Korea has denuclearised.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Senate hearing on Wednesday North Korea was continuing to produce fuel for nuclear bombs in spite of its pledge to denuclearize, even as he argued that the U.S. was making progress in talks with Pyongyang.Pompeo said North Korea had begun to dismantle a missile test site, something Kim also promised in Singapore,\nand called it “a good thing, steps forward”.However, he said Kim needed to follow through on his summit commitments to denuclearise.The UN Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, banning luxury goods said to include recreational sports equipment.NANAlso in the Lagos Prison Command, two inmates, Tunwase Kabiru and Oladipupo Moshood, have enrolled for their Doctorate d...Each day we receive complaints from men like you that are tired of suffering from premature ejaculation, weak erections...RelatedFormer Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Timi Frank, has cautioned Pres... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that “the nation’s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...The throne of a viable democracy stands on four sturdy legs.

It will not rid Singapore of drugs. By executing people for drug-related offences, which do not meet the threshold of most serious crimes, Singapore is violating international law.“Most of the world has turned its back on this ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. It is about time that Singapore does the same, starting by restoring a moratorium on all executions as a first step towards abolition of this punishment.”“Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, regardless of the method of execution or the crime for which it is imposed, and believes that there is no credible evidence that the death penalty has a unique deterrent effect.Obioha was found in possession of more than 2.6 kilogrammes of cannabis in April 2007, surpassing the amount of 500 grammes that triggers the automatic presumption of trafficking under Singapore law.Under Singaporean law, when there is a presumption of drug possession and trafficking, the burden of proof shifts from the prosecutor to the defendant. .Chijioke Stephen Obioha graduated in Industrial Chemistry from Benin University in Nigeria.

We also see lots of evidence that suggests that many of the low skill jobs will be taken over by technology.“Now, there’s also tremendous hope for technology. I think there’s tremendous hope that technology could help some African countries, many African countries we hope leapfrog and go forward and find new ways of driving economic growth.“But that there’s no getting away from the need to invest much more and much more effectively in health and education. When we say rates of childhood stunting over 30 percent, meaning these children their brains are simply not as well-developed as their non-stunted peers, and that they were learn less and they will earn less in the future.“We have good date on that. That when stunting rates are over 30 percent, sometimes close to 50 percent that that group of young — of children will not be prepared to compete in the digital economy in the future. So human capital is a huge, huge issue.“And I think, you know, if you look at all of the difficulties in terms of, you know, of increasing their resources for hard infrastructure, things like roads and energy, and also the need to increase investments in human capital. Every African country has to look much more seriously at how it improves its own domestic resource mobilization.“So in other words, they should be better at collecting taxes, you know, to just provide the basic services we think countries should collect at least 15 percent of GDP in taxes. Many countries don’t reach that level.“Also, if African countries were to remove fossil fuel subsidies that are often very regressive, in other words, they help the rich more than they help the poor. Even agriculture subsidies, there are many agricultural subsidies that are also very regressive.“They don’t help the small holder farmers, but they help others in the value chain. And things like tobacco taxes. Tobacco taxes have been shown to be very effective at raising revenue and decreasing smoking and can be used to finance all kinds of things.“So there’s so many things that can be done to help countries both invest in physical infrastructure and also invest in human capital, but it requires reform and it requires courage.“And so I know these kinds of things that I’m talking about are difficult, but please let all the African leaders know that the World Bank Group’s ready to help them undertake all those measures.”World Bank approves $2.1bn loan for NigeriaPope Francis reveals how Europe is exploiting Nigeria, other African countries2026 World Cup: African countries that did not vote for Morocco revealedTrump speaks on historic meeting with KimTrump cancels Singapore summit with Kim, gives reasonsBuhari/Obasanjo spat: African centre demands full probe of Nigeria’s past leadersCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","header":"Three things African leaders must urgently do – World Bank president, Kim","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:26:44.786Z"},"time":"\nPublished\non April 19, 2018\n\n"}

They then moved into a roughly 40-minute one-on-one meeting, joined only by their interpreters, before including their advisers.For all the upbeat talk, it remained to be seen what, if any, concrete results the sit-down would produce.\"We are going to have a great discussion and I think tremendous success. We will be tremendously successful,\" Trump said before their private session.Kim said through an interpreter: \"It wasn't easy for us to come here. There was a past that grabbed our ankles and wrong prejudices and practices that at times covered our eyes and ears. We overcame all that and we are here now.\"Aware that the eyes of the world were on a moment that many people never expected to ever see, Kim remarked that many of those watching \"will think of this as a scene from a fantasy ... science fiction movie.\"In the run-up to the meeting, Trump had predicted the two men might strike a nuclear deal or forge a formal end to the Korean War in the course of a single meeting or over several days. But on the eve of the summit, the White House unexpectedly announced Trump would depart Singapore by Tuesday evening, raising questions about whether his aspirations for an ambitious outcome had been scaled back.The meeting was the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.Critics of the summit leapt at the handshake and the moonlight stroll Kim took Monday night along the glittering Singapore waterfront, saying it was further evidence that Trump was helping legitimize Kim on the world stage as an equal of the U.S. president. Kim has been accused of horrific rights abuses against his people. During his stroll, crowds yelled out Kim's name and jostled to take pictures, and the North Korean leader posed for a selfie with Singapore officials.Trump responded to that commentary on Tuesday on Twitter, saying: \"The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters \u0026 losers.\" But he added \"our hostages\" are back home and testing, research and launches have stopped.Trump also tweeted: \"Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly ... but in the end, that doesn't matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!\"Addressing reporters on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sought to keep expectations in check, saying: \"We are hopeful this summit will have set the conditions for future successful talks.\"The summit capped a dizzying few days of foreign policy activity for Trump, who shocked U.S. allies over the weekend by using a meeting in Canada of the Group of Seven industrialized economies to alienate America's closest friends in the West. Lashing out over trade practices, Trump lobbed insults at his G-7 host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump left that summit early and, as he flew to Singapore, tweeted that he was yanking the U.S. out of the group's traditional closing statement.As for Singapore, the White House said Trump was leaving early because negotiations had moved \"more quickly than expected\" but gave no details. On the eve of the meeting, weeks of preparation appeared to pick up in pace, with U.S. and North Korean officials meeting throughout Monday at a Singapore hotel.The president planned to stop in Guam and Hawaii on the way back to Washington.Trump spoke only briefly in public on Monday, forecasting a \"nice\" outcome. Kim spent the day mostly out of view — until he embarked on the late-night sightseeing tour of Singapore, including the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, billed as the world's biggest glass greenhouse.Less than a year ago, Trump was threatening \"fire and fury\" against Kim, who in turn scorned the American president as a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\" As it happens, the North Korean and the American share a tendency to act unpredictably on the world stage.Beyond the impact on both leaders' political fortunes, the summit could shape the fate of countless people — the citizens of impoverished North Korea, the tens of millions living in the shadow of the North's nuclear threat, and millions more worldwide. Or, it could amount to little more than a much-photographed handshake.U.S. and North Korean officials huddled throughout Monday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, outlining specific goals for what the leaders should try to accomplish and multiple scenarios for resolving key issues, a senior U.S official said, adding that the meetings were also an ice breaker of sorts, allowing the teams to get better acquainted after decades of minimal contact between their nations.As Trump sought to build a bridge with Kim, he was smashing longtime alliances with Western allies with his abrasive performance at the G-7 and angry tweets directed at Trudeau and sent from aboard Air Force One as Trump flew from Quebec to Singapore.Trump advisers cast his actions as a show of strength before the Kim meeting.Alluding to the North's concerns that giving up its nuclear weapons could surrender its primary deterrent to forced regime change, Pompeo told reporters that the U.S. was prepared to take action to provide North Korea with \"sufficient certainty\" that denuclearization \"is not something that ends badly for them.\"He would not say whether that included the possibility of withdrawing U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, but said the context of the discussions was \"radically different than ever before.\"\"I can only say this,\" Pompeo said. \"We are prepared to take what will be security assurances that are different, unique, than America's been willing to provide previously.\"The North has faced crippling diplomatic and economic sanctions as it has advanced development of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Pompeo held firm to Trump's position that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes — and said they would even increase if diplomatic discussions did not progress positively.Experts believe the North is close to being able to target the entire U.S. mainland with its nuclear-armed missiles, and while there's deep skepticism that Kim will quickly give up those hard-won nukes, there's also some hope that diplomacy can replace the animosity between the U.S. and the North.While advisers say Trump has been reviewing briefing materials, the president insists his gut instincts will matter most when he gets in the room with Kim. He told reporters he thinks he will know almost immediately whether a deal can be made, saying: \"I will know, just my touch, my feel. That's what I do.\"APRelated TagsHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Trump, Kim Jong Un come together for momentous summit","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:27:40.391Z"},"time":"Mon 20 Aug"}

No, no, say others, you need to manage your expectations. This is just an elaborate get-to-know-you session, albeit between the two most famous leaders in the world, and nuclear armed at that.Actually, says another group, there will indeed be disarmament, a peace treaty ending the Korean War and North Korea's emergence as a contributing member of the international community - but just not right now.Whatever the results, it will be one of the more unusual summits in recent history as a flamboyant, often erratic U.S. president gets a close-up look at a hereditary socialist despot who sits on a nuclear weapons program.Here's a look at how Tuesday's first-ever meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the United States might turn out:WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE?Success in Singapore would see Kim making a bold decision to exchange his nukes for economic support and security assurances, according to Ryan Haas, an Asia expert at the John L. Thornton China Center. Both leaders would offer \"clear, specific, unequivocal statements\" outlining a dismantlement of North Korean weapons, an inventory and removal of all nuclear fuel and an opening up to U.N. nuclear inspectors.Trump has faced intense pressure to win something similar to this.A group of opposition Democratic lawmakers in the United States said in a statement that if Trump, a Republican, wants approval for a deal that allows an easing of sanctions on North Korea, he needs to get the permanent dismantlement and removal of \"every single one of North Korea's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,\" end all military nuclear fuel production and missile and nuclear tests, and persuade Pyongyang to \"commit to robust compliance inspections including a verification regime for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\"This is a very high bar and probably unrealistic after one meeting. Laboriously negotiated past nuclear deals, considered breakthroughs at the time, broke down on North Korea's extreme sensitivity to allowing in outsiders to look at whether they're dismantling their nuclear facilities, many of which are thought to be hidden.READ: Trump vs Kim insults: War of words between two leaders\"While a summit between Trump and Kim would be historic, it is unlikely to be decisive. This is not the fault of either Trump or Kim, but rather a reflection that intractable, decades-long strategic challenges rarely-if ever-get resolved in single encounters,\" Haas writes.SHOULD WE LOWER OUR EXPECTATIONS?Probably. In fact, Trump has been doing quite a bit of this lately.What was initially portrayed by the White House as a summit meant to completely rid the North of its nuclear weapons is now being cast as a chance to \"start a dialogue\" and for Trump the dealmaker to look into the eyes and take the measure of his nuclear-armed antagonist.Ferial Saeed, a former State Department official, writes that the summit will be a \"getting to know you meeting, 'plus.' That means, lower your expectations, and that the president is likely to lean toward keeping his own counsel and eschew a script. The 'plus' refers to discussions on ending the Korean War.\"China, both Koreas and the United States would have to sign off on any legally binding treaty, so it is unlikely Kim and Trump will do more than express an intention to end the war.Trump, after meeting recently with a North Korean envoy at the White House, said the summit will likely be part of \"a process.\"\"I told them today, take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly,\" Trump said.\"That is an extraordinary offer of flexibility, considering (North Korea) poses a direct security threat to the United States,\" according to Saeed.In part, these lowered expectations are a reflection of the extreme skepticism among many that the North can be persuaded to give up a nuclear program it has stubbornly built over the decades, often in secrecy and despite intense sanctions, international condemnation and widespread suffering among its people.\"There is no chance to make North Korean leaders ... surrender their nuclear weapons,\" Andrei Lankov, a Korea expert at Seoul's Kookmin University, wrote recently on a Washington-based Asia newsletter. \"They see denuclearization as a collective suicide (and they are probably right). However, now there are good chances to push North Korean nuclear/missile program back, for many years perhaps, and keep it that way for some time.\"WHAT IF THE SUMMIT FAILS?If things fall apart, it could be because \"Trump presents Kim with a hard-and-fast binary choice: relinquish nuclear weapons and live in peace and prosperity, or cling to them and risk the impoverishment of your people and the safety of your regime,\" Haas said.But a failure Tuesday doesn't necessarily mean a return to the animosity of 2017.That's in part because of South Korea's diplomatic outreach to the North, which was highlighted by two summits this spring between the rivals' leaders.If Trump and Kim fail in Singapore, \"the result may be to enhance North Korean dependency on Seoul and Beijing as safety valves against the prospect of renewal of U.S.-(North Korea) confrontation,\" according to Scott Snyder, a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"This circumstance in and of itself provides a new buffer against the prospect of military escalation in Korea that was not present at the end of 2017.\"APHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

The world will see a major change.”Trump said the process of denuclearisation would happen \"very, very quickly\", adding that he had formed a \"special bond\" with Kim and the relationship with North Korea would be very different.“This is going to lead to more and more and more,” Trump said.Asked whether he would invite Kim to the White House, Trump said: \"Absolutely, I will.\" He called Kim \"very smart\" and a \"very worthy, very hard negotiator.\"\"I learned he's a very talented man. I also learned that he loves his country very much.\"During a post-lunch stroll through the gardens of the Singapore hotel where the summit was held, Trump said the summit had gone \"better than anybody could have expected\".Kim stood silently alongside, but the North Korean leader had earlier described their meeting as a \"a good prelude to peace\".Both men walked to Trump's bullet-proof limousine, nicknamed \"The Beast\", and looked in at the rear seat, with Trump apparently showing Kim something inside. They then resumed their walk.Both men had appeared cautious and serious when they first arrived for the summit at the Capella hotel on Singapore's Sentosa, a resort island with luxury hotels, a casino, manmade beaches and a Universal Studios theme park.But, with cameras of the world's press trained on them, they displayed an initial atmosphere of bonhomie as they met on the verandah of the Capella, a refurbished 19th century British regimental officers' mess.After a handshake, they were soon smiling and holding each other by the arm, before Trump guided Kim to the library where they held a meeting with only their interpreters. Trump had said on Saturday he would know within a minute of meeting Kim whether he would reach a deal.Inside, they sat alongside each other against a backdrop of North Korean and U.S. flags, with Kim beaming broadly as the U.S. president gave him a thumbs up.The combatants of the 1950-53 Korean War are technically still at war, as the conflict, in which millions of people died, was concluded only with a truce.After initial exchanges lasting around 40 minutes, Trump and Kim emerged, walking side-by-side through the colonnaded hotel before entering a meeting room, where they were joined by their most senior officials.Kim was heard telling Trump through a translator: \"I think the entire world is watching this moment. Many people in the world will think of this as a scene from a fantasy...science fiction movie.\"Asked by a reporter how the meeting was going, Trump said: \"Very good. Very, very good. Good relationship.\"Kim also sounded positive about the prospects of peace.\"We overcame all kinds of scepticism and speculations about this summit and I believe that this is good for the peace,\" he said. \"I believe this is a good prelude for peace.\"The dollar jumped to a 3-week top on Tuesday and Asian shares rose on the news.Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and John Kelly, White House Chief of Staff, for the expanded talks, while Kim's team included former military intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, foreign minister Ri Yong Ho and Ri Su Yong, vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party.As the two leaders met, Singapore navy vessels, and air force Apache helicopters patrolled, while fighter jets and an Gulfstream 550 early warning aircraft circled.Body language expert said both men tried to project command as they met, but also displayed signs of nerves.After the meetings, the two teams and other senior officials met for a working lunch, where beef short ribs, sweet and sour pork and \"Daegu Jormin\", or Korean braised cod, were served for the main course, according to the menu. That was to be followed by dark chocolate tarts, pastries and vanilla ice cream for dessert. The North Korean leader's sister and close confidante Kim Yo Jong was among the lunch party.As the cameras captured the moment, Trump quipped: \"Very nice. Getting a good picture everyone, so we all look nice and handsome and thin...perfect\".In the hours before the summit began, Trump expressed optimism about prospects for the first-ever meeting of sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders, while Pompeo injected a note of caution whether Kim would prove to be sincere about his willingness to denuclearise.Pompeo said the summit should set the framework for \"the hard work that will follow\", insisting that North Korea had to move toward complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.North Korea, however, has shown little appetite for surrendering nuclear weapons it considers vital to the survival of Kim's dynastic rule.Sanctions on North Korea would remain in place until that happened, Pompeo said on Monday. \"If diplomacy does not move in the right direction ... those measures will increase.\"The White House said later that discussions with North Korea had moved \"more quickly than expected\" and Trump would leave Singapore on Tuesday night after the summit, rather than Wednesday, as scheduled earlier.Kim is due to leave on Tuesday afternoon, a source involved in the planning of his visit has said.One of the world's most reclusive leaders, Kim visited Singapore's waterfront on Monday, smiling and waving to onlookers, adding to a more affable image that has emerged since his April summit with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in.Trump spoke to Moon and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, both key allies of Washington in the region, to discuss developments ahead of the summit.\"I too, got little sleep last night,\" Moon told his cabinet in Seoul as the summit began in Singapore.\"I truly hope it will be a successful summit that will open a new age for the two Koreas and the United States and bring us complete denuclearisation and peace.\"Related TagsHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Trump, Kim Jong Un sign document at end of historic summit","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:28:52.805Z"},"time":"Mon 20 Aug"}

He had earlier been scheduled to leave on Wednesday.Kim is due to leave on Tuesday afternoon, a source involved in the planning of his visit, said on Sunday.Kim was not believed to have left his hotel since a meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong soon after his arrival in the city on Sunday, but he ventured out on Monday evening.The Swiss-educated leader, who is believed to be 34, has not left his isolated country since taking office in 2011 other than to visit China and the South Korean side of the border Demilitarised Zone, which separates the two Koreas.His first stop was a waterfront park with futuristic installations, Gardens by the Bay, which boasts the largest glass greenhouse and tallest indoor waterfall in the world.He joined Singapore's foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, who took a selfie, before stopping at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, which resembles a giant surfboard perched on three tall columns, for a look out over the bright lights of the city from its rooftop garden and swimming pool.On the way back to his hotel, Kim walked along a promenade near the Merlion, a giant statue, and fountain, of a mythical creature, half lion, half fish - Singapore's unofficial mascot.The rare public appearance of Kim, waving and smiling to onlookers, adds to the more affable image of the young leader that has emerged since his summit in April with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in.Just a few months ago, Kim was an international pariah accused of ordering the killing of his uncle, a half-brother and scores of officials suspected of disloyalty.'INTERESTING MEETING'Trump arrived in Singapore on Sunday after a blow-up over trade with other members of the Group of Seven major industrialised nations that cast a cloud over his efforts to score a major foreign policy win in the nuclear talks.Although gaps remain over what denuclearisation would entail, Trump sounded a positive note in a lunch meeting with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee.\"We've got a very interesting meeting ... tomorrow, and I just think it's going to work out very nicely,\" Trump said.It was a far cry from last year when Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" and mocked Kim as \"little rocket man,\" and Kim denounced the U.S. president as the \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\"Trump and Kim are staying in separate hotels less that a kilometre apart in the famous Orchard Road area of Singapore, dotted with high-rise luxury apartment blocks, offices and glittering shopping malls.Commenting for the first time on the summit, North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said the two sides would exchange \"wide-ranging and profound views\" to re-set relations. It heralded the summit as part of a \"changed era\".Discussions would focus on \"the issue of building a permanent and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean peninsula, the issue of realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and other issues of mutual concern\", KCNA said.In the lead up to the summit, North Korea rejected any unilateral nuclear disarmament, and KCNA's reference to denuclearisation of the peninsula has historically meant it wants the United States to remove its \"nuclear umbrella\" protecting South Korea and Japan.RISKThe White House said Trump would hold a one-on-one meeting with Kim on Tuesday on the small island of Sentosa. The two will later be joined by officials and have lunch together.Many experts on North Korea, one of the most insular and unpredictable countries in the world, remain sceptical Kim will ever completely abandon nuclear weapons. They believe Kim's engagement is aimed at getting the United States to ease the crippling sanctions that have squeezed the impoverished country.Kelsey Davenport, director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, said there were signs that the gaps between the two sides were narrowing but there was also risk.\"Trump is likely to declare the summit a victory irrespective of the outcome, but if the two sides fail to reach a common understanding of denuclearisation it will put at risk any process that the summit kicks off,\" he said.\"The process could be doomed before it begins.\"Trump initially touted the potential for a grand bargain with North Korea to rid itself of a nuclear missile programme that has advanced rapidly to threaten the United States.But he has since lowered expectations, backing away from an original demand for North Korea's swift denuclearisation.He has said the talks would be more about starting a relationship with Kim for a negotiating process that would take more than one summit.

I’ll never claim to be a perfect human being. We all have slip ups in life, I have many. Now let’s all move on to things that actually matter.”Few will disagree that the protagonists in today’s historic summit in Singapore - Trump and North Korean authoritarian Kim Jong-un - have giant egos. The summit is a meeting of two strongmen of 21st century politics.Trump and Kim will meet in front of the world’s media at around 9am local time. Any progress will have to be swift - the North Korean delegation is reportedly scheduled to leave Singapore as early as five hours later.Trump has previously said that nothing short of a commitment to total denuclearisation by the reclusive state will be good enough. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, said Kim travelled to Singapore with the intention of meeting the US leader and “meet the changing demands of the new era”.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, on the other hand, has expressed hope the summit will lead to a declaration to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. But a spokesperson said it’s unlikely that such a declaration would take place while Trump and Kim were still in Singapore. Trump has raised the possibility of further summits and an agreement ending the Korean War by replacing the armistice signed in 1953 with a peace treaty. China and South Korea would have to sign off on any legal treaty.Whatever the outcome of today’s summit, it is unquestionable that the world - and especially the Korean peninsula - will be a safer place if Kim curtails his nuclear ambitions and Trump stops his sabre-rattling.Still, it remains to be seen whether the Singapore summit will achieve anything in itself. Even if it doesn’t, it is not the end of the process, but merely a significant historic moment at its beginning. The chance to agree to a process of denuclearisation with Pyongyang is in itself a remarkable breakthrough.The MercuryHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"EDITOR'S VIEW: Trump-Kim summit stirs hope","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:30:23.412Z"},"time":"Mon 20 Aug"}

A day later, Trump said he had reconsidered, and officials from both countries were meeting to work out details.When Kim Chang Son was asked by a reporter at the Beijing airport if he was flying to Singapore for talks with the United States, he said he was \"going there to play,\" according to footage from Nippon Television Network.Meanwhile, North Korea's Kim Yong Chol, a senior official dealing with inter-Korean affairs was scheduled to fly to the United States on Wednesday after speaking to Chinese officials in Beijing, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said citing an unnamed source.Due to sanctions against him, Kim Yong Chol is banned from visiting the United States normally. His visit to the United States would indicate a waiver was granted.The United States and South Korea blacklisted Kim Yong Chol for supporting the North's nuclear and missile programmes in 2010 and 2016, respectively.Yonhap added Choe Kang Il, a North Korean foreign ministry official involved with North America issues, was also spotted at Beijing Capital International Airport. Yonhap did not say whether Choe would be accompanying Kim Yong Chol.In a flurry of diplomacy over the weekend, Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held a surprise meeting on Saturday at the border village of Panmunjom, during which they agreed the North Korea-U.S. summit must be held.And on Sunday, the U.S. State Department said American and North Korean officials had met at Panmunjom. Sung Kim, the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and current ambassador to the Philippines, led that American delegation, an American official told Reuters.Moon said on Monday that there could be more impromptu talks between the two Koreas in the lead-up to the summit.In Kim and Moon's first, upbeat meeting on April 27, they agreed to seek the \"complete denuclearisation\" of the Korean peninsula - but didn't define what that meant, or how that would proceed.Since then, North Korea has rejected U.S. demands for it to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons programme that experts say could threaten the United States.Pyongyang also demanded the United States halt future joint military drills with South Korea if it truly wishes for talks with North Korea, the North's Rodong Sinmun said on Tuesday. In response to reporters' questions regarding the report, South Korea's defense ministry said it does not have plans to change joint exercise schedules with the United States military.Analysts believe Washington is trying to determine whether North Korea is willing to agree on sufficient steps towards denuclearisation to allow a summit to take place.North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programmes as a deterrent against perceived aggression by the United States, which keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.It has long said it is open to eventually giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and ends its “nuclear umbrella” alliance with Seoul.Heated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"N.Korean official lands in Singapore as summit preparations advance","parent_keyword":"singapore trump summit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-20T16:30:43.783Z"},"time":"Mon 20 Aug"}

Trump welcomed a conciliatory statement from North Korea, saying it remained open to talks after he called off the summit with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un on Thursday.“It was a very nice statement they put out,” Trump said. “We’ll see what happens - it could even be the 12th. We’re talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it.”Earlier on Twitter, Trump had noted “very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea”.After decades of tension on the Korean peninsula and antagonism with the US over its nuclear weapons programme, Kim and Trump agreed to meet in what would be the first meeting between a serving US president and a North Korean leader.Trump scrapped the meeting on Thursday after repeated threats by North Korea to pull out of the summit in Singapore over what it saw as confrontational remarks by US officials. Trump cited North Korean hostility in cancelling the summit.In Pyongyang, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea’s recent criticisms of certain US officials had been a reaction to unbridled American rhetoric and that the antagonism showed “the urgent necessity” for the summit.“His sudden and unilateral announcement to cancel the summit is something unexpected to us and we cannot but feel great regret for it,” Kim Kye Gwan said.He added that North Korea remained open to resolving issues with Washington “regardless of ways, at any time”.North Korea had sharply criticised suggestions by Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Vice President Mike Pence that it could share the fate of Libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed by Nato-backed militants after halting his nuclear programme.Kim Kye Gwan said North Korea appreciated Trump for having made the bold decision to work toward a summit. “We even inwardly hoped that what is called ‘Trump formula’ would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue,” he said.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready for dialogue with the US, but a proposed summit between him and Trump was not working out for now. Trump said in March they would meet soon, but since then already poor ties between Washington and Moscow have deteriorated further. - ReutersHeated office argument leads to manager being burnt to deathDurban man cleared of rape after 13 years in prisonWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsOne missing CPUT student found alive, another deadSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

Trump is expected to hold talks with Lee on Monday.On the US side, joining Trump was a delegation of high-level officials,  including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton.Before boarding the Air Force One flight to Singapore, Trump said: “At a minimum, I do believe we will have met each other.”“We will have seen each other.\nHopefully we will have liked each other and we’ll start that process. I would say that would be the minimal.”The summit comes after months of speculation and disputes between Washington and Pyongyang that led Trump to briefly cancel the June 12 meeting on May 24.READ MORE: North Korea threatens to cancel US summitAfter a flurry of diplomatic efforts, including a White House meeting between by Kim’s right-hand man Kim Yong-chol and Trump, the proposed summit was put back on.Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from Singapore, said Trump has been sending “mixed messages” to Kim ahead of their meeting.“President Trump last month briefly called off this summit and he has repeatedly threatened to walk out if he doesn’t believe the negotiations are serious. That’s a tough position.”Authorities in Singapore imposed tight security around the summit venue and related luxury hotels, including installing extra pot plants outside one contender for Kim’s accommodation to obstruct reporters’ views.At stake at the summit are North Korea’s nuclear weapons and peace on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea spent decades developing nuclear weapons, culminating in the test of a thermonuclear device in 2017. It also successfully tested missiles that had enough range to reach the US mainland.The tests came amid a campaign of “maximum pressure,” led by Washington, that tightened economic sanctions against Pyongyang and raised the possibility of military action.In a New Year’s address, Kim said his country had completed development of its nuclear programme and would focus on economic development, suggesting a meeting with South Korea.After a flurry of contacts between the two Koreas , South Korean officials suggested to Trump in March that Kim would be willing to meet face-to-face.The talks will focus on reaching an agreement on the denuclearisation of North Korea in exchange for the easing of economic and diplomatic sanctions.Victor Teo, professor at the University of Hong Kong, believes “North Koreans are upbeat, but careful at the same time”.He told Al Jazeera: “A meeting where the optics are positive, meaning Trump gets a handshake with Kim Jong-un and they both go home agreeing to some kind of denuclearisation deal would go a long way domestically for President Trump as much as it would for the chairman of the state committee.” — Al JazeeraGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)Plans for a landmark summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un are moving “very nicely”, US President Donald Trump said Sunday, as the South’s leader said Kim told him the talks would be a historic opportunity to end decades of confrontation.The latest conciliatory declarations capped a turbulent few days of diplomatic brinkmanship on the Korean Peninsula that had sent tensions soaring.Trump rattled the region on Thursday by cancelling a planned June 12 meeting with Kim in Singapore, citing “open hostility” from Pyongyang.But within 24 hours he reversed course, saying it could still go ahead after productive talks were held with North Korean officials.“It’s moving along very nicely,” Trump told reporters late Saturday when asked for an update. “We’re looking at June 12 in Singapore.\nThat hasn’t changed.”Trump’s unpredictability sparked a sudden and surprise meeting on Saturday between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in — only the fourth time leaders from the two countries have ever met — as they scrambled to get the talks back on track.Pictures showed them shaking hands and embracing on the North Korean side of the Demilitarised Zone separating the two nations.Moon said Kim reached out to him to arrange the hasty meeting “without any formality”. There the North Korean leader described the Singapore summit as a landmark opportunity to end decades of confrontation.“He… expressed his intention to put an end to the history of war and confrontation through the success of the North-US summit and to cooperate for peace and prosperity,” Moon told reporters in Seoul on Sunday.Pyongyang’s state-run KCNA news agency said Kim “expressed his fixed will on the historic DPRK-US summit talks”, using the official abbreviation for North Korea.Kim said the two Koreas should “positively cooperate with each other as ever to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations and establish mechanism for permanent and durable peace,” KCNA added, saying South and North Korea would hold another round of “high-level” talks on June 1.Trump’s original decision to abandon the historic summit initially blindsided South Korea, which had been brokering a remarkable detente between Washington and Pyongyang and is desperate to avoid conflict breaking out.However, there was a further signal of progress Saturday as White House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed a team of US officials was leaving for Singapore “in order to prepare should the summit take place”.Last year, Trump and Kim were trading war threats and insults after Pyongyang tested its most powerful nuclear weapon to date and missiles it said were capable of reaching the US mainland.Tensions were calmed after Kim extended an olive branch by offering to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, sparking a rapid detente that led to Trump agreeing to hold direct talks with Pyongyang.Moon won the election last year partly by vowing to be open to dialogue with the North and finding a solution to a Cold War-era sore that continues to blight the region.The flurry of diplomatic backslapping and bonhomie disappeared in recent weeks as the summit was thrown into doubt by increasingly bellicose rhetoric from both top US administration officials and Pyongyang.There are still stark differences between what the two sides hope to achieve.Washington wants North Korea to give up all its nukes in a verifiable way as quickly as possible in return for sanctions and economic relief.Pyongyang has a different view of what denuclearisation might look like and remains deeply worried that abandoning that deterrent would leave the country vulnerable to regime change.“Kim stressed again that he had a firm determination towards complete denuclearisation,” Moon told reporters Sunday.“The thing he was uncertain about was not denuclearisation but concerns on whether he could trust that the US would end its hostile policy and guarantee the security of his regime when the North denuclearises itself.”Saturday’s meeting between Moon and Kim took place on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, a heavily fortified village that lies between the two countries where the 1953 armistice was signed.Only last month, the two leaders met in the same village, with Kim famously inviting Moon to step briefly into the North before they both held talks in a building on the South’s side.Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korea studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said Moon and Kim moved quickly to defuse the crisis after Trump’s shock cancellation.“Moon essentially helped relay messages from Trump to Kim and vice versa, to further smooth the process and to resume negotiations,” he told AFP, saying the Singapore meeting was “clearly back on track”.Unlike last month’s summit, which was held in front of live TV cameras, Saturday’s meeting took place in utmost secrecy, with reporters only told later that the face-to-face had taken place.Footage released by the Blue House on Twitter, accompanied by a dramatic orchestral score, showed Moon arriving in a convoy of cars and first shaking hands with Kim’s sister Kim Yo Jong, who has played a major public role in recent talks with the South.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

Specifics on how both pledges will be achieved at this stage unknown but details are expected to be revealed later on Tuesday in a media briefing.The summit as a whole has launched hopes for a peace deal for the divided Korean Peninsula and a concrete agreement that Pyongyang will scale back or dismantle its nuclear programme. Both Trump and Kim have expressed optimism throughout the summit with Trump saying “people are going to be very … happy and we are going to take care of a very dangerous problem for the world” when describing what the outcomes of the joint agreement will be.Kim said the leaders had “decided to leave the past behind” and that “the world will see a major change”. Trump and Kim’s one-on-one meeting is the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader and the two marked this historic moment with a handshake and cautious smiles.[(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)]During a media briefing before the meeting, Trump said he is confident that the talks will be a “tremendous success” and Kim said “it has not been easy to get here.

(Reuters)Donald Trump dangled the carrot of foreign investment in front of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at their nuclear summit, but analysts say few will want to put money into one of the highest-risk business environments in the world.The US president showed Kim a movie of bright lights, high-speed trains and soaring tower blocks — pitching a future that could be possible if Pyongyang gives up its weapons.Optimists say that with mineral wealth, cheap labour, and a helpful geographical location, the North has huge potential.But the history of overseas firms who have tried to set up operations in the isolated, impoverished country is a long and sorry one.Rules that can change on a whim, bills that are never paid, and the threat of expropriation hang over foreigners who step into the wildest of wild east investment destinations.For now, dozens of restrictions apply under the various sanctions regimes imposed on the North over its nuclear ambitions.Joint ventures are banned by the UN Security Council, the European Union blocks financial transfers of more than €5 000, and US regulations mean international banks are loath to enable transactions of any kind –- so much so that even humanitarian organisations struggle to fund their activities.READ MORE: History and handshakes — Five key takeaways from the Korea summitAnd even if they are lifted, there are major challenges to working in the North.Infrastructure is poor, and analysts say corruption is widespread.Crucially, said a diplomatic source in Pyongyang, “legal guarantees for business are very weak”.During the Sunshine Policy, a previous period of warmer ties, South Korean conglomerate Hyundai poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a tourist resort for Southerners to visit the scenic Mount Kumgang.But the trips came to an abrupt halt when a North Korean soldier shot dead a woman from the South who strayed into a forbidden zone.Many South Korean firms set up operations in the joint-venture Kaesong Industrial Complex where they employed cheap labour from the North, but Seoul closed the project in 2016 over Pyongyang’s weapons programmes.Egyptian telecom firm Orascom poured hundreds of millions of dollars into setting up the North’s first mobile phone network, Koryolink, only for the government to set up a rival operator of its own.The company was also unable to get its money out.“I am taking all the hits,” Orascom’s billionaire owner Naguib Sawiris told Bloomberg last month. “I am being paid in a currency that doesn’t get exchanged very easily, I have put a lot of money and built a hotel and did a lot of good stuff there.”Construction giant LafargeHolcim last year disposed of its stake in a North Korean cement plant for an undisclosed sum, nursing significant losses.“Governance is weak, information is lacking and there are huge cultural gaps with local partners,” said Geoffrey See, founder of Choson Exchange, a non-profit that trains entrepreneurs and economic policymakers in the North.The most successful foreign firms in the North, he added, focus on trading activities to avoid having assets in the country that are vulnerable to seizure.Kim undoubtedly wants to make his country better off.\nHe declared earlier this year that having completed the development of his nuclear arsenal, “socialist economic construction” was now his top priority.State media’s coverage of the Singapore summit included extensive pictures of the prosperous city-state, a port, and even Kim’s motorcade passing a Cartier advert — images that would not have been shown in the past.It was an indication of “permissible aspiration”, said an Asia-based diplomat.The highly secretive North has been quietly bringing in reforms for several years, allowing private traders to operate in informal markets, giving state-owned enterprises some freedoms to operate, and turning a blind eye to private company operations.The moves are reminiscent of China’s “reform and opening” under Deng Xiaoping, which propelled the country from a basketcase to the world’s second-largest economy.Foreign firms have also begun to make inquiries since Pyongyang’s recent diplomatic thaw, says Michael Spavor of Paektu Consulting, who has been working with the country for 20 years.“Our organisation has had much interest recently from investors interested in market research as well as face-to-face matchmaking with potential DPRK ministries and future partners,” he told AFP, using the official acronym for North Korea.But the North has not officially embraced the market. At the last ruling party congress, Kim decried the “filthy wind of bourgeois liberty and ‘reform’ and ‘openness’ blowing in our neighbourhood”.China has taken North Korean officials on study tours of Beijing, Shanghai and its coal-rich provinces to try to encourage them to follow its example, and diplomats say it is offering detailed development planning.But they add that Pyongyang is wary of being too dependent on Beijing, and prefers to look to Vietnam for an example of how a smaller Communist country has been able to adopt capitalism while not weakening the authorities’ hold on power.READ MORE: Big Brother capitalism for North KoreaNorth Korea does have some advantages, says Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist for Capital Economics, pointing out natural resources including zinc, magnesite, iron and copper, low-cost labour, and an advantageous location.But even if sanctions are lifted, he said, “it’s basically a police state and you have a long way to go to North Korea becoming a normal economy”.“It’s going to take a very brave investor to venture in again.”© Agence France-PresseGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Reuters)\nNorth Korea threatened Wednesday to cancel the forthcoming summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump if Washington seeks to push Pyongyang into unilaterally giving up its nuclear arsenal. It also cancelled high-level talks due Wednesday with Seoul over the Max Thunder joint military exercises being held between the United States and South Korea, denouncing the drills as a “rude and wicked provocation”. It is a sudden and dramatic return to the the rhetoric of the past by Pyongyang, after months of rapid diplomatic rapprochement on the peninsula. “If the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue,” first vice foreign minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement carried by state media. In that case, he added, Pyongyang would have to “reconsider” its participation at the summit, due in Singapore on June 12. The North’s arsenal is expected to be at the top of the agenda of the historic talks, but Pyongyang has long insisted it needs the weapons to defend itself against invasion by the US. Washington is pressing for its complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. But so far the North has not given any public indication of what concessions it is offering, beyond euphemistic commitments to denuclearisation of the “Korean peninsula”. Pyongyang had “made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearisation is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States”, minister Kim said. In the past, Pyongyang has demanded the withdrawal of the US troops stationed in the South to protect it from its neighbour, and an end to Washington’s nuclear umbrella over its security ally. The minister also blasted US National Security Advisor John Bolton’s talk of a “Libyan model” for North Korean denuclearisation. It was a “sinister move to impose on our dignified state the destiny of Libya or Iraq”, he said.\n“I cannot suppress indignation at such moves of the US, and harbour doubt about the US sincerity.” The North has long said it needs nuclear weapons to protect itself against a US invasion. After giving up his atomic programme, Libyan leader Moamer Khadafi was killed in an uprising backed by NATO bombing. Minister Kim also dismissed offers by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who has visited Pyongyang twice in recent weeks, coming back the second time with three released US detainees — for US economic aid if the North denuclearises. “We have never had any expectation of US support in carrying out our economic construction and will not at all make such a deal in future,” Kim said. In recent weeks, as well as an eye-catching summit with the South’s leader last month in the Demilitarized Zone, Kim has twice met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pyongyang has announced it will destroy its nuclear testing site next week. Analysts said Pyongyang was now trying to redefine the terms of the debate. “It’s a diplomatic tactic,” Kim Hyun-wook, professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, told AFP, calling it “brinkmanship to change the US position”. “It looks like Kim Jong Un was pushed into accepting US demands for ‘denuclearisation-first’ but is now trying to change its position after normalising North Korea-China relations and securing economic assistance,” he added. “The classic North Korean tightrope diplomacy between the US and China has begun.” US officials have repeatedly claimed credit for Washington’s “maximum pressure” policy for bringing Pyongyang to the negotiating table. Joshua Pollack of the Middlebury Institute for International Studies said Pyongyang had been irritated by the “triumphalist tone”. “The North Koreans aren’t happy with what they’re seeing and hearing,” he said. “There is still a yawning gulf between expectations for diplomacy in Pyongyang and Washington, DC.” Earlier KCNA denounced the Max Thunder joint military exercises being held between the US and South Korea as a “rude and wicked provocation”, and Seoul said it had received a message cancelling planned high-level talks “indefinitely”. The two-week drills started last Friday and involves some 100 aircraft from the two allies, including F-22 stealth fighter jets. Pyongyang’s move was “regrettable”, said unification ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun, adding it “contradicts the fundamental spirit and purpose of the Panmunjom Declaration”. Hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War stopped with a ceasefire, leaving the two halves of the peninsula divided by the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and still technically at war. The North has spent decades developing its atomic arsenal and missiles capable of reaching the US, earning itself multiple rounds of UN Security Council resolutions, while Trump and Kim traded personal insults and threats of war last year. Relations underwent a sudden turnaround as Moon used February’s Winter Olympics in the South to broker talks between Washington and Pyongyang. Washington said it will continue to plan the meeting in Singapore on June 12, with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert telling reporters it had received “no notification” of a position change by North Korea. The exercises were “not provocative” and would continue, she added.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

According to custom, the khukri must draw blood every time it is unsheathed.“They are among the best Singapore can offer, and I am sure they will be involved (in the summit),” said Tim Huxley, an expert on Singapore’s armed forces at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).“They remain very much a substantial and front line force, and the demands of this kind of event are precisely the sort of special operation that the Gurkhas are trained to handle,” he said.A spokesman for the Singapore police declined to comment on the deployment of the Gurkhas or their numbers.The IISS Military Balance says 1,800 Gurkhas serve in the Singapore police, across six paramilitary companies.A legacy in part of the British colonial era and more recent pragmatic Singaporean leadership, Singapore’s Gurkhas are linked to a British tradition that has recruited and paid for elite regiments of soldiers from Nepal for more than 200 years.Beaten back by the Gurkhas in the 19th century Anglo-Nepalese War and admired for their valour and fighting skills, the colonial British then began to recruit them. Now Gurkhas serve in the British, Indian and Nepalese armies, as well as in Brunei and Singapore.They have fought in both world wars as well as the Falklands conflict and, more recently, in Afghanistan.‘Tough, vigilant and steadfast’Huxley said the Gurkhas had long proven to be an asset to Singapore’s leadership, providing a neutral force within an ethnically diverse city-state, including VIP and anti-riot protection.At times of regional tension, they have protected international schools, and are often seen at the Malaysia-Singapore border crossings.The Singapore Police website describes the group as “tough, vigilant and steadfast” that operates “across the spectrum of paramilitary operations to help safeguard Singapore”.They live with their families in the secure Mount Vernon Camp outside the city, an enclave that ordinary Singaporeans are not allowed to enter.A woman married to a Gurkha who lived in the camp said life there was restricted.“We have a curfew of 12 midnight,” she said. “For women, we can let them know if we have a genuine reason to stay out, for men, there is no excuse.“One of the rules we have is that we have to be in bed by 10.30pm every night. This means no music, no nothing. Even if we have a party, we need to stop. If not, there will be some form of enforcement by the people patrolling.” Typically recruited at 18 or 19 before being trained in Singapore, the Gurkha soldiers retire at 45 when they are repatriated. While their children attend local schools, Gurkhas are not allowed to marry local women.A handful of ex-British Army officers serve as sworn-in Singapore police in senior leadership, training and organisational roles.“Although they are police, the links between the contingent and the British Army remain deep and strong,” one British Army officer said. “They are part of a fine tradition.”Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTrump offers condolences to SaudisWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAE'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown Dubai traffic, transport plans during Eid rushGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

That’s raising concerns about the risk of holding such a monumental meeting with barely anyone to bear witness.Trump and Kim will meet on Singapore’s Sentosa Island for roughly 45 minutes while their entourages wait nearby.The huddle will come before a larger meeting and a working lunch attended by top advisers to the president and their North Korean counterparts.Word of the private meeting unleashed a torrent of criticism on social media from national security veterans who worry the lack of a transcript will create a he-said-he-said showdown that could turn into a major headache for Trump. AFPSingapore: Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will make history on Tuesday, becoming the first sitting US and North Korean leaders to meet, shake hands and negotiate to end a decades-old nuclear stand-off.The extraordinary summit — unthinkable only months ago — comes after the two nuclear-armed foes appeared on the verge of conflict late last year as they slung personal insults and Kim conducted nuclear and missile tests.Trump called on the international community to exert “maximum pressure” to buckle Kim’s regime and threatened to unleash “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if Pyongyang continued to threaten the US.For his part, Kim called Trump a “mentally deranged US dotard” and said he would “tame” him, “with fire”.That will seem a distant memory later Tuesday amid the palms and whitewashed walls of Singapore’s ultra-exclusive Capella Hotel, where the two men will walk towards each other and then sit down for an initial half-day of meetings with ramifications for the entire world.It is a historic meeting for both men — perhaps comparable to president Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to China, or Ronald Reagan’s summit 1986 with Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik.It is potentially legacy-defining — as long as they can disprove critics’ fears that the meeting will be more about drama than detail.The North has promised to give up its weapons in the past, while a long history of previous agreements have ultimately foundered.“If there is no statement of intentions to move toward a peace treaty, if there’s no statement from the North Korean side on denuclearisation, we’re going to find ourselves very quickly in a very hollow summit,” said Ryan Hass of the Brookings Institution.If that happened, he added, “quickly we’ll move into a space of mutual recrimination and finger-pointing about whose fault it was”.On the eve of the summit, Trump — who is due to leave Singapore on Tuesday evening — said optimistically: “I just think it’s going to work out very nicely.”Hugely symbolic talksThe pair — Kim in his thirties and consolidating his dictatorship, Trump in his seventies and struggling to bend Washington to his impetuous will — are unlikely protagonists, both instantly recognisable and larger-than-life.But their work this week is deadly serious.Washington and Pyongyang are still technically at war, even if the mortars, carbines and gunships of the bloody 1950s conflict have long since fallen silent.And the totalitarian regime has made rapid progress towards marrying nuclear and missile technology that would put Los Angeles, New York and Washington within striking distance of a nuclear holocaust.The United States says that is unacceptable and will be dealt with, one way or another.But for North Korea the mere fact of the talks is a hugely symbolic advance.For its leader, standing as an equal beside the US president in front of a phalanx of cameras is a goal the pariah state has sought for decades, with critics charging that it legitimises one of the most ruthless regimes.On Monday evening Kim — accompanied by a phalanx of bodyguards and his personal television crew — took a night-time stroll on the Singapore waterfront, even posing for grinning selfies with the city-state’s foreign minister.‘Brighter future’Yet it remains far from clear that Pyongyang is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, which it says it needs to defend itself against a US invasion.On the eve of the meeting, aides from both sides were still scrambling to narrow yawning differences over “denuclearisation”, which means vastly different things to the two parties.Trump will use what he says are long-honed instincts to see whether Kim if bluffing, buying time or serious.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the United States was willing to offer the regime “unique” security guarantees, to “provide them sufficient certainty that they can be comfortable that denuclearisation is not something that ends badly for them”.Kim and Trump will first meet one-on-one in a closed session, before a larger meeting with key advisers, US officials said.But Pompeo signalled that the summit was likely to be the start of a longer process of negotiation, and warned the United States would not be “duped”, with nothing less than complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation considered.Max -

And while the summit was heavy on pointed moments, it has — at least on paper — offered the prospect of a Korean peninsula that is committed to peace.On his part, Kim committed his nation to the complete demilitarisation of the Korean peninsula, while the US offered a security pledge that would eliminate the threat of conflict. One immediate effect of this was that Washington has cancelled its military exercises with South Korea. Both Kim and Trump have also committed themselves to the peace overtures agreed between Kim and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea when they met in a historic meeting at the Demilitarised Zone in April. Indeed, this aspect of the Singapore summit serves as a timely reminder that North and South remain technically in a state of war with the Korean War ending nearly 65 years ago in a cessation of hostilities.It is always hard to fathom the immediate results of any much-anticipated meeting between adversaries. The very fact that both Trump and Kim met is a success in itself, given that the summit seemed as if it would be cancelled — a threat that underlined the distrust between Washington and Pyongyang. Yes, there is a commitment to denuclearisation on the peninsula, but that is one that both the US and North Korea have signed before in 2005. Certainly, the fact that both men met within six months of threatening to unleash nuclear devastation from their atomic arsenals shows that progress has been made.There is a reality too, however, that the regime in Pyongyang has a long and chequered history of promising concessions and then reneging on them — and that 2005 agreement is a casualty of Korean convenience in that regard. It ought to be remembered that it has taken the imposition of severe economic and financial sanctions against Pyongyang to get it to the table — along with the threat of military action. Yes, the Singapore summit marked an opportunity to reset relations. But real progress can only be measured by verifiable and unfettered inspections, and by adherence to specific targets and goals. The threat of those sanctions must remain a presence now moving forward. It’s one thing to commit to denuclearisation, another to adhere to that commitment away from the pomp and circumstance of summitry.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedTrump: McGahn allowed to cooperate with MuellerTrump increasingly takes aim at ChinaFuture political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...For balanced journalism, we need media and journalists to in ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTrump offers condolences to SaudisWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAE'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown Dubai traffic, transport plans during Eid rushGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

And how can anyone be sure that North Korea is really denuclearising? A look at some of the questions.1. Between Trump and Kim, who got the better deal? Both Trump and Kim got things they want. Trump appears to have resolved the immediate threat of war and cast himself as a peacemaker. But Kim’s wins — suspended US military drills, new international status, improved relations with China and South Korea and talk of easing sanctions — are more substantial.2. What are the chances that the Koreas will actually be united as one nation?They’re better now than they were a year ago. But reconciling the two political systems is daunting. More likely is decades of economic and cultural integration before anything that could be described as unification is possible.3. How will this change relations between the US and South Korea, particularly the presence of US troops?So far, Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are pretty much in line. There are still few details about Trump’s decision to suspend US “war games” in South Korea, which could fuel discussion about a weakening of the alliance. While Trump has talked about lowering overseas troop deployments, he says that’s not on the table for South Korea right now.4. What do we now know about Kim that we didn’t know before, based on his presence at the summit?We know that Kim is far less cautious about his public appearances than many had surmised. He didn’t look exactly comfortable strolling around Singapore’s tourist spots surrounded by a phalanx of guards, but he spent more than two hours out on the town, and seemed happy to have those images published back in Pyongyang.5. How can anyone be sure that North Korea is really denuclearising? And how can the US make sure Kim will keep his commitments?That’s perhaps the biggest of the many questions left unanswered by this joint statement yesterday. Not only was there no mention of verification and inspection, but the two sides didn’t establish what denuclearisation means. Asked about this yesterday, Trump said: “I think he wants to get it done. I really feel that very strongly.”6. Apart from denuclearisation, could you give a quick recap of what was agreed to at the summit and what we need to watch for in the coming months?There are four main points of the joint statement: establishing new US-North Korea relations, building a lasting and stable peace regime, reaffirming North Korea’s commitment to “complete denuclearisation” and repatriating American war dead. There’s also Trump’s decision to suspend military exercises.7. Did Trump or Kim say anything about the human rights record of North Korea? How will this rapprochement affect ordinary North Koreans?This question led to some of the most interesting exchanges during Trump’s sprawling news conference after the signing with Kim. First, Trump acknowledged that human rights was not a major topic during the meeting, saying it “was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearisation.” When pressed later about whether he had betrayed the political prisoners in North Korean gulags, Trump suggested that improving relations would help them.8. Who made this summit possible, and why wasn’t South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited?A lot of people can claim credit for making the summit happen, Kim and Trump, obviously. But Moon played a key role in opening the dialogue and getting things back on track after Trump cancelled the meeting last month. China and Singapore also provided key logistical support.9. Is this summit a game-changer for Asia and the rest of the world? Which countries have the most riding on a concrete peace deal?Rather than a game-changer, this was more of a breakthrough in how the US and North Korea talk to each other. Having open channels of communication can only minimise the risk of miscalculation. North Korea and South Korea have the most riding on a peace deal, but China, which is next door, is probably next in line.10. What have observers been saying about the possibility of Trump (or Kim) getting a Nobel Peace Prize?Moon says Trump deserves a Peace Prize. Others might say it’s Moon who is probably more deserving, since he was pushing Trump and Kim toward peace when they were still both threatening nuclear war. Others might say let’s wait until there’s an actual peace deal before we start doling out accolades.11. Why has it taken this long to get North Korea to the table? What’s the best-case and worst-case scenario we can hope for?North Korea has resisted talks over the years because it disagreed with the US’s preconditions — mainly, a clear commitment to an inspection-and-verification regime. But it has long wanted a meeting with a US president. Trump’s decision to meet Kim without that clear path to denuclearisation removed the roadblock.Best-case scenario is the two sides start talking, North Korea decides the US is no longer a threat and scales back its arsenal. Worst case is the US decides North Korea isn’t cooperating and we go back to war threats.12. After all those nuclear and missile tests, it seems as if Kim Jong-un has suddenly signalled he wants peace. Why the change of strategy?There is not enough known about North Korea to fully explain Kim’s motivations. But the North Koreans have expertly escalated and de-escalated tensions to suit their needs over the years. Now that Kim has a hydrogen bomb and missiles that can deliver it to the US, he says he doesn’t need to test them anymore and can dedicate more of his resources toward the economy.Also, this has been a long time coming. Kim has put an increasing focus on developing his nation’s economy since he came to power in 2011.Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTrump offers condolences to SaudisWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAE'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown Dubai traffic, transport plans during Eid rushGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Both Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump are right to assure that they will indeed meet June 12 in Singapore. The planning now finally being put in place at meetings in Panmunjom and at the White House is a key to success and must be taken seriously and used smartly. There is much to do, the time is short, and the trail is complex and tricky.We welcome the efforts to open communications between the United States and North Korea facilitated by the diplomatic efforts of South Korea. We also recognise that one meeting — even a summit — cannot be expected to produce an immediate solution to the decades-old North Korean nuclear problem. This is just the beginning of a long process that will require persistence and patience to succeed.Current circumstances could open the door to bringing about goals the key participants have said they wish to achieve. North Korea’s leadership appears to wants a more secure and productive relationship with its neighbours and with the broader global community, especially the US.South Korea wants a stable and peaceful relationship with its northern neighbour that offers opportunities for development of the peninsula. The US — and the rest of the international community — needs to see an end to North Korea’s experiment with nuclear weapons and intercontinental delivery vehicles.And China seeks a Korean Peninsula on its border functioning in a way that produces stability and confidence rather than uncertainty and potential conflict.What can this summit achieve?First and foremost, it must produce an agreed-upon statement committing the parties not only to a permanent end to hostilities but to the complete, irreversible, full and verifiable denuclearisation of the peninsula. Those who see this as a measure to be taken in one leap must also see the hard reality. As Trump has noted, steps and stages may be the only secure and permanent way to achieve that main goal.Second, a freeze in missile and nuclear-weapons testing is clearly needed, certainly for as long as conversations continue on the main goals of peace and denuclearisation.The US has shown it is prepared to demonstrate that its regular joint exercises with South Korea are defensive in nature, do not envision the use of nuclear weapons and are not an attempt to decapitate the North Korean leadership.Avoiding misunderstandingsIt is critical that the summit yield a precise understanding of these first reciprocal steps to avoid misunderstandings such as the confusion last month over the presence of American B-52 bombers in the area.Third, it is necessary to begin moving down the more difficult road of eliminating the production of fissile material for weapons use. North Korea should reaffirm its September 2005 commitment to the Six-Party agreement by abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes and returning, at an early date, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and to safeguards established by the International Atomic Energy Agency.For its part, the United States should reiterate the affirmation made in that statement that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and has no intention to attack North Korea with either nuclear or conventional weapons.In a parallel process, South Korea should also reiterate its commitment not to receive or deploy nuclear weapons, while reaffirming that there are no such weapons within its borders.Early steps in that regard would be a declaration by all concerned parties of the existence and location of all facilities either engaged — or that could be engaged — in nuclear weapons-related activities; an agreement to cease all weapons development; and the application of reciprocal arrangements for verification.In return, in addition to humanitarian and economic support already noted publicly, the United States should agree to a dedicated energy programme for North Korea based in part on past efforts related to peaceful production of nuclear energy. This would ensure that reciprocity, balance and proportion are part of the process.The summit should thus be designed as a launch pad for sustained, structured negotiations leading to the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of the North Korean nuclear-weapons programme, while taking concrete steps that reduce tensions and encourage North Korea’s continuing compliance.Such a sustained and smart diplomatic effort is the only viable means to resolving the challenges posed by North Korea. We should all stand ready to promote and support that effort.— Washington PostChristopher R.

This footage shows the rescue, said to have been carried out in the Paravur administrative division of Ernakulam, a district in Kerala, where 27 other locals were also rescued. As many as 1,568 relief camps have been built for people displaced by the floods, the Times of India reported. Credit: PRO Defence Trivandrum ‏ via StoryfulTHE worst floods in a century in the Indian state of Kerala have so far killed over 300 people and forced more than 200,000 into relief camps, officials say, with the toll expected to rise.As the southwestern coastal state’s chief minister sought military reinforcements to boost rescue efforts, a disaster management official said that, since the monsoon season started about three months ago, more than 320 people had died due to flooding and landslides.As the waters have risen, many people have found it increasingly hard to access food and other basic amenities, or to reach safety.During the current monsoon, Kerala has been hit with over a third more rain than average, according to India’s weather office. The floods are the worst in a century.In the latest bout that began nine days ago, 164 people have died and some 223,000 moved into more than 1500 relief camps, Vijayan said.Heavy rains began hitting parts of the state again on Saturday morning, slowing attempts to deploy rescuers and get relief supplies to isolated areas, many of which have seen no help for days and can only be reached by boat or helicopter.Rains are expected to subside to “light to moderate” levels on Sunday, India’s weather office said.A witness in a relief helicopter in Chengannur, a town in southern Kerala, saw people stranded on roof tops and waving desperately for help.“The town looked like an island dotted with houses and cars submerged in muddy flood waters and downed coconut trees,” he said.Two circling navy helicopters dropped food and water in metal baskets and flown out at least four people, including a three-year-old child.Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, said his department had geared up to meet victims’ needs.“We’ve deployed adequate doctors and staff and provided all essential medicines in the relief camps,” he said.His teams were also making arrangements to minimise the risk of people contracting waterborne diseases once they return home after the floodwaters subside.The rains have also disrupted transport networks in Kerala, a major destination for domestic and foreign tourists.Some crops have also been inundated. The state is a major producer of rubber, tea, coffee and spices such as black pepper and cardamom.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter he would travel to Kerala “to take stock of the unfortunate situation”.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

More than 350 people have died and hundreds of thousands have lost their homes, according to the Associated Press, as weeks of torrential rain have caused massive flooding in the popular tourist state of Kerala. Photo: APMORE than 400 people have died since heavy rain hit Kerala in recent weeks, triggering deadly landslides and submerging entire villages as rivers burst their banks. The rain had barely stopped falling in the town on the outskirts of the southern Indian state’s main city, Kochi, and abandoned cars, sodden furniture and mattresses filled the streets while dirty black water still flowed above knee-level.A foul smell greeted people arriving at the Union Christian College, where classrooms and halls became a relief camp for up to 4000 at the peak of the floods.Some have started to leave. Residents who remain speculated that the stench was from rubbish and dead cats, dogs and rats — or worse.“Maybe it’s human,” said one survivor.Savita Saha, one of the migrants in the big hall, said: “This smell is of five days without a bath”, adding, “Everyone here is wearing the clothes they had when they escaped.In one classroom Rasitha Sojith, from the nearby neighbourhood of Kaprassery, sobbed as she told how she escaped through chest-high waters carrying her two-month-old son.Sojith said water burst into her home without warning last Wednesday while her father and sister, with her three children, were visiting to see the new baby.“With water rising fast, we only grabbed a few clothes for the baby and went to the first-floor terrace of the neighbour’s house,” she said.Torrential rain fell for hours and they grew increasingly fearful of becoming trapped, until local fishermen rowed the family to safety the next day.“Everything is lost. Everything! We don’t even have money to go back to our neighbourhood,” said Sojith.“I don’t think we will be leaving this camp any time soon.”An estimated 725,000 people are crammed into similar makeshift camps across Kerala.Authorities have given a provisional damage toll of $3 billion but the extent of the destruction is likely to prove much greater, some officials and legislators say.In the Malikampeedika area of Kochi, Mumthaz, who goes by one name, found the smell waiting for her when she returned home.“This muddy rubble and stench is all that is left of our memories,” Mumthaz told AFP, as she dragged out mud-caked mattresses and a sofa set, damaged utensils and even her daughters’ school awards.As word spread of flood warnings, Mumthaz had taken her two daughters on Thursday to the home of her parents-in-law in another neighbourhood.But floodwater soon surged through their house as well and the whole family had to be rescued.“It was surreal. The water was close to the knees at one point and within a few minutes it was touching five feet, with a current so strong that we saw big cars floating like tin cans,” she said.With her husband searching for work in Dubai, Mumthaz knows she will struggle to look after her daughters, with the family facing an uncertain future after the nightmare of the floods.“There is no kitchen, electricity and water here. I don’t know how long it will take before I will be back … (in) my home,” she said.To join the conversation, please Log in. Don't have an account?

Rains have been diminishing in parts of Kerala state, where floods and landslides have killed more than 200 people in less than two weeks and about 800,000 more have been forced into thousands of relief camps. Abdul Samad, a 56-year-old fish seller, scooped water and garbage from his devastated concrete home in the town of Pandalam. \"When the flood waters came, we were not anticipating a calamity of this kind,\" he said. \"But minute by minute the water level began to rise.\" The family had no time to save anything they owned, and fled as water poured over the wall and into the home. Samad, who made a living pedaling through the area selling fish, has no idea now what he'll do for work. Among the many things he lost in the floodwaters: his bicycle. Torrential rains began Aug. 8 in Kerala in the midst of the annual monsoon season, eventually leaving much of the state partially submerged. The Indian military also opened an air base Monday to commercial flights to help bring in relief goods and fly out residents. The first flight landed Monday morning at the naval air station in the city of Kochi, where the commercial airport has been closed for nearly a week. The Air India flight came from Bangalore in the nearby state of Karnataka, Suresh Prabhu, the minister of civil aviation, said on Twitter. Other air bases in the region should open to commercial traffic soon, he said. Thousands of people are taking shelter in small camps in the coastal town of Alappuzha. Many are in schools, but at least one is on the grounds of a mosque where Christians, Hindus and Muslims have all found food and a place to sleep. The town itself, which is on slightly higher ground, escaped the worst of the flooding, but the situation is far more grim just a few kilometers (a couple of miles) away. \"The water came almost up to my head,\" said Ullas, a 48-year-old man who uses only one name, who fled his village for the safety of the town. He has no idea when he'll be able to come back. \"We don't know,\" he said, as he helped distribute food in one relief center. \"It could take a month.\" With rains decreasing, the water has started receding in parts of Kerala but thousands of people remain cut off and in need of help. Thousands of people have been saved by the state's fishermen, many of whom headed into the floodwaters to help. On Monday, the state's top official, Pinarayi Vijayan, announced the government would pay those fishermen about $50 for each day they helped and also pay for repairs for boats damaged during rescues. Officials say it is the worst flooding in Kerala in a century, with rainfall in some areas well over double that of a typical monsoon season.

Decreasing rains and floodwaters means the navy can cut back on its rescue teams in Kerala, navy spokesman Capt. D.K. Sharma said in a statement Monday. The navy has rescued nearly 16,000 people in the state. The annual monsoon rains were already underway in Kerala when it was hit by torrential downpours beginning Aug. 8. The rains had decreased substantially by Monday and meteorologists are expecting light-to-moderate rains in coming days. Thousands of people have been leaving Kerala's relief camps over the past two days, heading home to check on damage and begin the long process of cleaning up. \"There was sludge and muck nearly up to my knee,\" a dismayed Abdullah Aliyar said Tuesday. The 65-year-old, who has been living with his family at a relief camp for more than a week, returned briefly to his nearby home Monday to find it uninhabitable and without drinking water or electricity. For now, the family of five will remain at Union Christian College, a sprawling campus on high ground just outside Kochi. It is one of more than 3,000 relief camps created amid the havoc of the floods. Volunteers at the camp estimate that up to 10,000 people were jammed into the schools' buildings a week ago.

As the southwestern coastal state's chief minister sought military reinforcements to boost rescue efforts, a disaster management official said that, since the monsoon season started about three months ago, more than 320 people had died due to flooding and landslides. As the waters have risen, many people have found it increasingly hard to access food and other basic amenities, or to reach safety. During the current monsoon, Kerala has been hit with over a third more rain than average, according to India's weather office. The floods are the worst in a century. In the latest bout that began nine days ago, 164 people have died and some 223,000 moved into more than 1500 relief camps, Vijayan said. Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for most parts of the state on Saturday, and authorities said they planned to implement controlled releases of water from dams to manage flows and minimise damage. Rains are expected to subside to \"light to moderate\" levels on Sunday, India's weather office said. A witness in a relief helicopter in Chengannur, a town in southern Kerala, saw people stranded on roof tops and waving desperately for help. \"The town looked like an island dotted with houses and cars submerged in muddy flood waters and downed coconut trees,\" he said. Two circling navy helicopters dropped food and water in metal baskets and flown out at least four people, including a three-year-old child. Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, said his department had geared up to meet victims' needs. \"We've deployed adequate doctors and staff and provided all essential medicines in the relief camps,\" he said. His teams were also making arrangements to minimise the risk of people contracting waterborne diseases once they return home after the floodwaters subside. The rains have also disrupted transport networks in Kerala, a major destination for domestic and foreign tourists. Some crops have also been inundated. The state is a major producer of rubber, tea, coffee and spices such as black pepper and cardamom. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter he would travel to Kerala \"to take stock of the unfortunate situation\".","header":" Hundreds dead in Indian flood disaster  ","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T18:55:47.129Z"},"time":"Tuesday, 21 August 2018"}

The downpours that started on August 8 have triggered floods and landslides and caused homes and bridges to collapse across Kerala, known for its quiet tropical backwaters and beautiful beaches. Thousands of rescuers were continuing efforts to reach out to stranded people and get relief supplies to isolated areas by hundreds of boats and nearly two dozen helicopters, said P.H. Kurian, a top disaster management official in Kerala. He said weather conditions had improved considerably and expected the nearly 10,000 people still stranded to be rescued by today. An estimated 800,000 people have taken shelter in around 4000 relief camps across Kerala, Kurian said. Weather officials predicted more rains across the state yesterday. In several villages in the suburbs of Chengannur, one of the worst-affected areas, carcasses of dead cattle were seen floating in muddy waters as water began receding. However, vast rice fields continued to be marooned and many vehicles were submerged. In some villages, floodwaters up to 3m high had entered homes. Officials have called it the worst flooding in Kerala in a century, with twice the rainfall of a typical monsoon season in some areas. Officials estimate that more than 10,000km of roads have been damaged. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised more than US$70 million ($105.7m) in aid.

The worst floods in a century in Kerala, in the southwest of India, has forced more than 200,000 people into more than 5600 relief camps and the toll is expected to rise. Mathew, his wife, Divya, and their daughters, Hazel, 4, and Jizelle, 3 months old, arrived in Kerala on August 4 for a holiday and they will also attend a family wedding this week and the baptism of Jizelle today. \"I've volunteered to help out with cooking and distributing food in the relief camp that has people from as young as newborn to those that are 90 years old. They have lost everything. \"The flood was so sudden and people ran with only the clothes on their backs. Most people I know lost their school certificate and text books.

Three hours after she spoke to her father about 7pm last Wednesday, the water level rose rapidly and forced him to climb onto the roof. \"While we're happy he is safe, we don't know what is left of our house after floodwaters recede. That's also the situation with thousands of people currently in relief camps throughout the state,\" she said.

Sakeena demonstrating the method of superchlorination to one of the affected families.Dr. Sakeena says that the amount of chlorine used for superchlorination should be in proportion to the quantity of water in the well. “For 1,000 litres of water, we should use five grams of chlorine,” she says.The water in a normal well can be measured in terms of the number of rings it has. “Each ring of well can roughly be estimated to contain 1,000 litres of water. So a well with 20 rings can supposedly contain 20,000 litres of water,” Dr. Sakeena says.The DMO takes the required quantity of chlorine for a well in a bucket, then makes a paste of that by adding some water, and then adds three-fourths of a bucketful of water to it. After stirring the content, she allows it to sediment.After the sedimentation, the clear chlorine water is poured into another bucket and then lowered into the well using a rope. After chlorinating the well, water should not be used for one hour.Dr. Sakeena advises people to boil the water for 20 minutes for drinking even after superchlorination. “You can use this water for any domestic use. But you must boil it for 20 minutes for drinking.”Superchlorination should be done every day for a week. Then for the next week, it should be done twice a week. “For the next couple of weeks, superchlorination should be done weekly,” the DMO says.The Government of Maldives will donate $50,000 (roughly ₹ 35 lakhs) towards flood relief in Kerala, authorities said.The donation, according to a statement issued by the President’s office late Sunday, is being made as “a token contribution in solidarity with the people of India, for the ongoing rescue and relief operations in the flood-hit state of Kerala.” A Keralite working in Sultanate of Oman in a supermarket has been terminated from his job following a highly insensitive post he wrote in the wake of the worst-ever floods in the State.Rahul C.

The Indian Army has appealed to the public to forward disinformation about Indian Army on WhatsApp to +917290028579.Meanwhile, another viral audio clip by one Suresh Kochattil has also kicked up a controversy.In the audio clip, a text version of which is posted on his Facebook page too, he is heard saying that most of the people who were impacted by the floods in Kerala are from well to do families. He claimed that they do not need any handouts and there is more than what is required in Kerala now. He can be also heard casting doubt on the fund utilisation from the Chief Minister's Disaster Relief Fund, and requesting people to contribute to “organisations like Seva Bharathi” instead.The audio clip in English, which has been spread in WhatsApp groups outside the State too, led to all-round condemnation from people who have been involved in the rescue and relief efforts over the past few days.Even as the State has been going through an unprecedented disaster, there has also been a deluge of fake information in WhatsApp groups. The fake messages ranged from stories about bursting of dams to fake calls for rescue. The volume of fake information was so much that the Chief Minister had to issue a warning to those involved in such activities to abstain from spreading misinformation on WhatsApp and social media networks.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 21, 2018 4:01:14 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-battles-fake-news-along-with-floods/article24732678.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nKerala battles fake news along with floods ","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T18:59:11.598Z"},"time":"\n\nAugust 20, 2018 00:03 IST\n\n"}

We are going to do it immediately. The cost would easily be Rs 10,000 crore. Secondly, it would be the construction of houses — around 1 lakh houses have been severely damaged and the state government will have to spend Rs 4 lakh on each. It’s a huge amount of money. In Kerala, it’s not possible to do a hotchpotch job. The restoration of electricity and water connection itself would cost Rs 2,000 crore.”Isaac, who is a senior CPI(M) MLA, said the second major component of the financial cost would be the completion of a “package for Kuttanad” in Alappuzha, which is one of the worst-affected areas. “This will require Rs 2,000 crore and the afforestation programme would cost another Rs 3,000 crore.

Its lead author, Pune-based ecologist Madhav Gadgil, has publicly argued that had the report’s suggestions been implemented by the concerned state governments, the scale of disaster in Kerala would not have been as huge as it is. A look at some of the main recommendations of the Gadgil report, how these were substantially relaxed by a subsequent committee led by space scientist K Kasturirangan, and whether implementation of the first report would have made any difference to the Kerala crisis:Why was the Gadgil Committee set up?In February 2010, then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh attended a public meeting in Kotagiri in Tamil Nadu organised mainly by those associated with Save the Western Ghats group. Speakers pointed to threats to the ecosystem from construction, mining, industries, real estate, and hydropower. After the meeting, Ramesh set up the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel under Gadgil. The panel was asked to make an assessment of the ecology and biodiversity of the Western Ghats and suggest measures to conserve, protect and rejuvenate the entire range that stretches to over 1500 km along the coast, with its footprints in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.READ | Kerala tragedy partly man made: Madhav Gadgil, expert who headed Western Ghats reportWhat did the Gadgil Committee say?It defined the boundaries of the Western Ghats for the purposes of ecological management. The total area in this boundary came to 1,29,037 square km, running about 1.490 km north to south, with a maximum width of 210 km in Tamil Nadu and minimum of 48 km in Maharashtra. It proposed that this entire area be designated as ecologically sensitive area (ESA). Within this area, smaller regions were to be identified as ecologically sensitive zones (ESZ) I, II or III based on their existing condition and nature of threat. It proposed to divide the area into about 2,200 grids, each approximately 9 km × 9 km, of which 75 per cent would fall under ESZ I or II or under already existing protected areas such as wildlife sanctuaries or natural parks.It recommended:* Ban on cultivation of genetically modified in entire area\n* Plastic bags to be phased out in three years\n* No new special economic zones or hill stations to be allowed\n* Ban on conversion of public lands to private lands, and on diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes in ESZ I and II\n* No new mining licences in ESZ I and II area\n* No new dams in ESZ I\n* No new thermal power plants or large scale wind power projects in ESZ I\n* No new polluting industries in ESZ I and ESZ II areas\n* No new railway lines or major roads in ESZ I and II areas\n* Strict regulation of tourism\n* Cumulative impact assessment for all new projects like dams, mines, tourism, housing\n* Phase-out of all chemical pesticides within five to eight years in ESZ I and ESZ IIThe committee proposed a Western Ghats Ecology Authority to regulate these activities in the area.READ | ‘Floods in Kerala grave… political lobbying prevented implementation of Gadgil report’What was the need for the subsequent Kasturirangan Committee?None of the six concerned states agreed with the recommendations of the Gadgil Committee, which submitted its report in August 2011 (its official public release was cancelled). Suggestions and comments were received from a number of others as well. In August 2012, then Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan constituted a High-Level Working Group on Western Ghats under Kasturirangan to “examine” the Gadgil Committee report in a “holistic and multidisciplinary fashion in the light of responses received” from states, central ministries and others. This committee submitted its report in April 2013.Its report revealed that of the nearly 1,750 responses it had examined, 81% were not in favour of the Gadgil recommendations. In particular, Kerala had objected to the proposed ban on sand mining and quarrying, restrictions on transport infrastructure and wind energy projects, embargos on hydroelectric projects, and inter-basin transfer of river waters, and also the complete ban on new polluting industries.So, what did the Kasturirangan Committee say?It broadened the definition of Western Ghats and included a total of 1,64,280 square km in it. It then classified it as comprising cultural landscape and natural landscape. It said nearly 60% of the Western Ghats was cultural landscape, where human settlements, agriculture and plantations existed. The remaining was natural landscape, of which the “biologically rich” area was only 37% or about 60,000 sq km. It was only this part that the committee said needed to be classified as ecologically sensitive area (ESA)Its main recommendations for ESA* Ban on mining, quarrying and sand mining\n* No new thermal power projects, but hydro power projects allowed with restrictions\n* Ban on new polluting industries\n* Building and construction projects up to 20,000 sq m was to be allowed but townships were to be banned\n* Forest diversion could be allowed with extra safeguardsWhat was finally decided?Last year, the Environment Ministry notified an area of 56,285 sq km in the Western Ghats as ESA. This was slightly less than the 59,940 sq km recommended by the Kasturirangan committee. In Kerala, specifically, the Kasturirangan committee had proposed an area of 13,108 square km as part of ESA. This was brought down to 9,993.7 sq km at the insistence of Kerala government.Would implementation of the Gadgil report have lessened the impact of the Kerala floods?The Kerala disaster essentially has been caused by extreme rainfall. Since the 2013 Uttarakhand flooding, such extreme rainfall events have led to one disaster-like situation in India every year. The Gadgil report was submitted in 2011. Even if the state governments had begun implementing the recommendations in all seriousness immediately thereafter, it is not clear what activities would have stopped. What Gadgil seems to be arguing for is the need to learn lessons from past tragedies, and increase the resilience of disaster-struck areas through sustainable and long-term development that would involve minimal intervention in natural processes. Even in the Uttarakhand disaster, uncontrolled construction, large hydropower plants and deforestation were assessed to have aided the scale of destruction.\n\u003cimg width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/amitabh-sinha.jpg?w=400\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" /\u003eAmitabh SinhaAmitabh Sinha is Resident Editor, Pune.

He also took away bodies of two inmates who died at the home during the calamity,” says Dr Anin Aniyan from Social Security Division of Kerala health department, who is a member of the medical relief team.“The situation at the mental health home was sad. The patients could not be moved out. The deaths did not occur due to drowning but probably due to the crisis created by the floods. We heard that one of the persons who died was a diabetic and his condition was compounded by the lack of medicines and food,’’ said U R Rahul, a postgraduate student at Thrissur Government Medical College and a member of the team.Over the past five days, the medical relief team has reached some of the most inaccessible villages of Thrissur district that are surrounded by water for several kilometres.On Sunday, the six-member team took the first consignment of medical supplies to the marooned Kundoor village near Mala in Chalakudy region, which has been cut off by the flooding of Chalakudy river. The members walked through chest-deep water for over 3 km with supplies to reach a remote camp with over 500 people.READ | A step-by-step guide on how you can donate to the Kerala CM’s relief fund“This is the first time we are seeing relief workers in this region.

There is the danger of epidemics like chicken pox and respiratory diseases because the flood has forced hundreds of people to live together in cramped conditions,’’ says Dr Sumesh, a psychiatry professor who is part of the medical team.“We are doing our best now but a bigger crisis looms ahead,’’ says Dr Raveendran, a senior professor of gastroenterology and another member of the team.READ | Kerala floods: Pastor donates land for people to bury dead New Delhi: The Kerala government has asked for 90 medicines from the Centre to prepare for disease outbreaks after floodwaters recede.

Videos on social media showed groups of people breaking open shops to take food.Chief Minister Vijayan has estimated that more than two million people have been forced to move into relief camps since the monsoon season brought torrential rains three months ago.

(Xinhua)NEW DELHI, Aug 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in India's floods-hit southern state of Kerala has risen to 357, even as rescue and relief work is being carried out on a war footing. Banana and paddy crops spread over 850 acres of land have been destroyed, said unofficial estimates.Nearly 250,000 people have been shifted to over 1500 relief camps set up across the state, and many more are being rescued from their submerged houses.All the three wings of India's defence forces -- army, navy and air force, have been pressed into service to save lives in the devastated state witnessing worst ever floods in a century.Directly suprervised by the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the rescue and relief work is being carried out by as many 67 helicopters, 24 aircraft, 548 motorboats, and thousands of personnel from the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy, Indian Army and the Indian Coast Guard in the flood-affected areas.While rescuing, priority is being given to those taken ill, the old, women and children.Meanwhile, situation is slowly returning to normalcy even as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday night withdrew the red alert from as many as eight of the 13 districts affected by the deluge. Rains have been predicted on Sunday as well.A meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) is held in New Delhi on a daily basis to take stock of the situation and review the rescue and relief operation depending on the requests from the state government.Basic necessity items like food materials, medicines, clothes, etc., are being air dropped among the affected people with the help of choppers.Financial and other aid have been committed by several sources. Several Indian states have announced financial assistance and other relief materials for the people in the state.Prime Minister Modi had announced on Saturday an immediate financial assistance of five billion Indian Rupees (around 75 million U.S. dollars) for the floods-ravaged southern state of Kerala.

The flood situation in Kerala has eased to a large extent with sky turning clear in the state but affected areas in the districts of Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam and Thrissur are still reeling under crises. Several people are still stranded in these areas even as rescue operations have entered the final stages.\"Like in the aftermath of a natural disaster, enough care was being taken to ensure prevention of outbreak of any epidemic in the water-logged areas. According to a report in the Indian Express, the state has sought from the federal government 90 different kinds of medicines to prepare in advance for disease outbreaks.Health Minister J.P. Nadda assured all kinds of medical help to the state devastated by floods, described as the worst in a century.He said that he was in regular touch with his counterpart in the state government, and that his ministry was coordinating with other Indian states which have promised to provide medicines so as to augment supplies.\"We are monitoring the flood situation in Kerala on a regular basis. Heath Secretary in Delhi is in constant communication with the state health functionaries and monitoring the situation daily through the disease surveillance network,\" said Nadda.There is said to be an acute shortage of drinking water in the flood-affected districts in the state. To address this problem, the Railways Ministry is making elaborate arrangements to provide potable water.According to sources in the Railways Ministry, as many as 300,000 water bottles of one liter each have already been dispatched for the flood-ravaged state. Besides, nearly 2 million liters of water was being transported to Kerala through water-special trains in various parts to cater to the needs of the people living in relief camps.Rough estimates that there are nearly 1 million people staying in around 5,000 relief camps across the state.Tourism Minister K.J. Alphons, who hails from Kerala, tweeted: \"Today we have close to a million people in relief camps. District collectors are working as coordinators and providing supplies. Central forces are providing amazing service to Kerala. Biggest heroes are fishermen, they came in 600 boats and are rescuing people.\"Amid water logging in some parts of the state, the Indian Railways has announced cancellation of as many as four long-distance trains, partially cancelled three other trains, and diverted the routes of some trains.Indian Railways' staff have been working round-the-clock to clear the tracks of debris/carcasses due to earth slips, boulders and uprooted trees.Officials were deployed near sensitive locations such as rail bridges, tunnels and curves to gauge water levels.In order to get the state connected with the rest of the country, trains are run to various destinations through the available diverted routes touching districts of Erode, Dindigul, Karur, Tirunelveli and Nagercoil.Daily special trains are run between Ernakulam district to the state capital Trivandrum via Alleppey district which helped many rescue officials to reach different places with support.Meanwhile, in a major development addressing the connectivity problem, air operations began at Cochin city even as a commercial flight landed at the naval base airstrip on Monday morning.This stopgap arrangement has been made as air services from the Cochin International Airport have been suspended over the last few days owing to water-logging on the runway amid incessant rains.It's after 18 years that this naval base airstrip has been used for civil flight operations.India's Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted: \"Congratulations to team @airindiain. 1st scheduled flight lands at Cochin INS Garuda (the alternate site for Cochin Airport) from Bangalore with over 70 passengers.\"Xi requires strengthening CPC leadership, Party building in militaryWeekly choices of Xinhua photoHuaibei inundated by flood due to Typhoon Rumbia in east ChinaS.Korean war-separated families leave for DPRK for reunions with long-lost relativesSquirrel monkeys seen in Suzhou, E China's JiangsuScenery of prairie in Urad Zhongqi, N China's Inner MongoliaLos Angeles Tanabata Festival kicks offComics Art Museum, one of main attractions of Brussels","header":"\nFlood-hit Indian state Kerala stares at uphill task of relief, reconstruction \n","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T19:10:17.583Z"},"time":"\nTuesday, August  21, 2018\n"}

They are struggling with low salinity which harms shellfish reproduction, water stagnation, pollution and agro-chemical run-off.Over-fishing and the mounting impacts of climate change - including warmer water in the lake, a decline in winter rains and severe flash floods during the monsoon - are making matters worse.The 1.5 million people supported by Vembanad, one of India's largest lakes, live off agriculture, fishing, clam collecting, duck breeding, coconut fibre production, tourism and water-based transport. But yields have been falling and times are hard.\"To get the same quantity of black clam meat that we used to collect, process and sell in three hours, today takes nine,\" said NK Raju of Sarithodu village, one of 5,000 clam gatherers in Vembanad's south, as he processed the day's haul of just 8 kg (17.64 lb) on an open fire in a lean-to.Half the wetland's 150 fish species have been wiped out since the Thanneermukkom barrage was built in 1975, show fish counts by the Bangalore-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).So in 2008, a group of fishermen decided they would make an effort to protect their livelihoods by trying to conserve the lake's natural resources.Priyadarsanan Dharma Rajan, a senior fellow with ATREE, said his organisation worked with the fishermen to develop a \"bottom-up\" conservation model.\"The fisherfolk use their traditional ecological wisdom (and) we help them partner with scientists to identify problems and solutions which they themselves implement,\" he explained.The fishermen set up Lake Protection Forums (LPFs), legally registered bodies, which numbered 13 by 2011, spread across Alappuzha and Kottayam districts, each with 50 members, 20 of them women.\n","header":"Kerala fishermen tackle pollution, clam theft to protect wetland","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T19:12:26.884Z"},"time":null}

SK Engineering \u0026 Construction, a South Korean firm, is a partner in the project.\nThe dam is one of five auxiliary dams in the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy project, which collapsed, flooding seven nearby villages and displacing more than 6,600 people. The flooding killed at least 27 people, leaving more than 130 missing, according to local media reports.\n\"The role of a humanitarian mission is important as this disaster also involves a South Korean firm,\" said Roh Dong-whan, the leader of the relief team. \"We'd like to provide assistance to affected residents warmly and actively.\"\nThe team plans to install a base camp, possibly on Monday, at a health service center in the Sanamxay town of Attapeu Province and work in cooperation with the medical staff from the provincial hospital. \"We're going to move quickly with a goal of setting up a clinic there tomorrow,\" Roh said. \"We will also dispatch our medical personnel to the provincial hospital upon request.\"\nThe team is the first South Korean emergency medical team to be dispatched since 2014, when the government sent a team to Ebola-hit Sierra Leone.\nIn rescue efforts, the government will provide $500,000 in cash and $500,000 worth of materials to help Laos recover from the disaster. \nTwo Korean military aircraft carrying relief supplies arrived in Laos Saturday (local time) via the Philippines, according to government officials.\nThe supplies include 1,200 blankets, clothing and sanitation items provided by the government, the South Korean Red Cross and SK Engineering \u0026 Construction Co.

The builder said that the 200 workers sent to the country are working without rest and are moving swiftly to distribute 2 billion won ($1.78 million) worth of relief supplies to those affected by the flooding. \nThe company has brought in 50 tons of food, 50 tons of medicine and household goods and 10 tons of clothing to help those displaced by the disaster.

The news of the tragedy only reached Bangkok yesterday morning.\nHouses in Attapeu’s southern Sanamxay district were swept away, claiming lives, and several hundred people were missing, according to the state-run Lao News Agency.\nPrime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith suspended his monthly cabinet meeting and led senior government officials to Sanamxay to monitor rescue and relief efforts.\nThe collapse of the support dam caused flash flooding in six Sanamxay villages – Yai Thae, Hinlad, Mai, Thasengchan, Tha Hin and Samong. Hinlad and Mai were particularly hard hit.\nPictures and videos shown on state-run and social media showed the chaotic evacuation of people from inundated areas. Many people were seen clinging to the roofs of their houses, surrounded by water. \nThere were claims on social media of many people dead and missing, but no official report from local authorities as of press time.\nAuthorities in Attapeu pleaded for agencies to provide emergency aid for the victims, including clothing, food, drinking water and medicine.\nAttapeu Planning and Investment Department Director Soulichanh Phonkeo told the Vientiane Times newspaper that some victims were washed away in the torrent, but many managed to grab tree branches and wait for rescue.\n“We need a large number of boats to rescue them from the danger area,” he said.\nAn official of Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Co (PNPC) had on Monday issued a warning of danger at the dam. In a letter, the company’s head of resettlement, Lee Kan Yeol, told colleagues in Champasak and Attapeu provinces that, “Saddle Dam D is not safe and is in very dangerous condition” due to heavy rainfall.\nHe advised that the saddle dam’s failure would unleash five billion tonnes of water into the Xe Pian River basin. Lee said people living along the river downstream should be moved to higher ground to avoid an “unfortunate accident” if the heavy rain caused one.\nThe 410-megawatt Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy Dam is expected to generate 1,860 gigawatt-hours of power when completed. The project is budgeted for US$1.2 (Bt40 billion).\nPNPC is a joint venture formed in March 2012 by SK Engineering and Construction (which has a 24-per-cent stake), Lao Holding State Enterprise (26 per cent) and Korea Western Power and Thailand’s Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding (RATCH), which together hold the balance of shares.\nRATCH director Kijja Sripatthangkura said Saddle Dam D was one of five sections surrounding the main dam and its collapse would not affect power production from the project. \nBut he noted that 600 million cubic metres of water had flooded seven villages and affected more than 6,000 people in 1,700 households. His company was coordinating with officials at the site about repairing the damage, he said, but the work could not begin until more water can be released from the main dam.\nPianporn Deetes of the conservation group International Rivers said there were major risks with dams that are not designed to cope with extreme weather conditions such as very heavy rain. And unpredictable extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in the region due to climate change, she said. \n“This disaster also shows the inadequacy of warning systems for the dam construction and operations,” said Pianporn, who has long monitored dams in the Mekong River basin. \n“The warning appears to have to come very late and was ineffective in giving people advance notice to ensure their families’ safety.”","header":"Thousands flee as dam breaks in Laos","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T19:18:36.523Z"},"time":"ASEAN+  July 25, 2018 01:00"}

The situation is bad in many parts of the state and the number (of deaths) will likely increase,\" a senior official from the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority told AFP.Unconfirmed local media reports mentioned a much higher toll and cited ongoing efforts to reach many flooded areas.The official added that authorities had issued a \"red-alert\" warning in all 14 districts of the flood-ravaged state, with heavy downpours expected over the next 24 hours in many of the worst affected areas.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's office announced on Twitter that Kochi International Airport -- the main gateway to the region -- would be closed until Saturday \"due to heavy rains and resultant flooding\".Vijayan held emergency meetings with rescue officials in the state late Wednesday and discussed the situation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The chief minister has requested the deployment of additional personnel from the Indian army, navy and other emergency forces who are already working across the state, which is home to around 33 million people.\"Our state is in the midst of an unprecedented flood havoc,\" Vijayan said earlier this week. \"The calamity has caused immeasurable misery and devastation.\"Authorities have opened the gates of 34 reservoirs as water reached dangerous levels.Vijayan's office on Wednesday said that the authorities were also worried about rising water levels in the massive Mullaperiyar dam, and urged officials in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu to release water from the reservoir.Hundreds of villages have been flooded, more than 10,000 kilometres (6,000 miles) of roads and thousands of homes have been destroyed or damaged across the state, officials said.\"We have asked all airlines, domestic and foreign, to reschedule their Cochin flights either from Trivandrum or from Calicut,\" Suresh Prabhu, India's civil aviation minister said on Twitter.\"For international flights, this will require special dispensation which has been granted considering the emergency DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) is coordinating,\" he added.The US embassy last week advised Americans to avoid Kerala, which drew more than one million foreign tourists last year, according to official data.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group","header":"Flood toll in India's tourist hotspot Kerala jumps to 67","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:16:50.261Z"},"time":"\nPublished:\n  10:32 BST, 15 August 2018\n"}

Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,\" an official in the Kerala government's public relations department told AFP.Local reports indicated an even higher toll with thousands still waiting for relief and rescue across the flood-ravaged state.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that he had discussed the flood situation with Vijayan as more troops and rescue workers were deployed across Kerala.\"Later this evening, I will be heading to Kerala to take stock of the unfortunate situation,\" Modi said on Twitter.The state, famed for its palm-lined beaches and tea plantations, is always pommelled by the annual monsoon but this year's damage has been the most severe in almost a century.More than 150,000 people made homeless across the state have moved into some 1,300 relief camps.Vijayan's office Friday posted a fresh warning for around 33 million residents of Kerala.\"Alert: all districts apart from Kasargod are under red alert... heavy rains may affect these 13 districts. Everyone please be cautious,\" his office tweeted.Even before the latest warning, locals like Ajo Varghese have been posting desperate appeals for relief and rescue on social media.\"My family and neighbouring families are in trouble with flood in Pandanad nakkada area in Alappuzha,\" Varghese said in a viral Facebook post.\"No water and food. Not able to communicate from afternoon. Mobile phones are not reachable and switch off. Please help... No rescue is available,\" he added.A state official told AFP that apart from the new rainfall warnings, a breakdown of the local communication system was making it difficult for them to reach local people who may be in urgent need in the worst-affected areas.The government says 10,000 kilometres (6,000 miles) of Kerala roads have been destroyed or damaged and tens of thousands of homes partially or completely damaged.The gates of at least 34 major dams and reservoirs across the state have been opened in the last few days as water levels reached danger levels.North and central Kerala has been worst-hit by the floods with the international airport in main city of Kochi shut until at least August 26.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group","header":"Flood death toll in India's Kerala jumps to 164","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:17:07.486Z"},"time":"\nPublished:\n  08:42 BST, 17 August 2018\n"}

Army helicopters and boats kept up missions to find trapped survivors and drop food and water in isolated villages.The Indian government has declared the floods a \"calamity of severe nature\", a home ministry official told AFP.Officials said 22,000 people were rescued on Sunday. At least 30 bodies were also found, taking the death toll above 200 since the torrential rain started falling on August 8 and more than 400 since the monsoon started in June.At least 1,000 were feared stranded in five villages around Chengannur, one of the districts worst hit by the deluge.An Indian Navy team made a temporary rope bridge across a stream in Thrissur district on Sunday to rescue 100 people stranded for days.Commercial flight operations to Kochi, the state's main city, resumed Monday after the navy opened its airstrips for small passenger aircraft. The city's international airport has been ordered shut until Sunday.The floods have left widespread desolation in the city.Mumthaz fled her home in the Malikapeedika district of Kochi with her daughters aged 13 and nine last Thursday.She went to her husband's parents in another neighbourhood but within a few hours even that was also flooded and they had to be rescued and taken to a relief camp.- Hunt for missing -\"It was surreal. The water was close to the knees at one point and within a few minutes it was touching five feet with a current so strong that we saw big cars floating like tin cans,\" said Mumthaz, who has only one name.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the priority now was to provide clean drinking water and restore power supplies to the state of 33 million people.\"The total number of people taking refuge at the 5,645 relief camps has risen to 724,649,\" Vijayan told reporters Sunday.He said health officers would be deployed in each village to check the spread of communicable diseases.Thousands of army, navy and air force personnel have fanned out to help those stranded in remote and hilly areas. Dozens of helicopters have been dropping tonnes of food, medicine and water over areas cut off due to damaged roads and bridges.In the worst-hit areas such as Thrissur and Chengannur, rescuers searched inundated houses, discovering the bodies of those trapped by the fast rising floodwaters.\"They didn't think that it would rise this high -- 10 to 15 feet (3-4.5 metres) at some places -- when the initial warnings were issued,\" said Ashraf Ali K.M., who is leading the search in the small town of Mala in Thrissur.Fishermen have sailed inland from Kerala's coast to join the search, as volunteers set up soup kitchens and an international appeal was made for financial help.The state government said each fishing boat would get 3,000 rupees ($43) for each day of work and that authorities would pay for any damage to them.The floods have caused an estimated $3 billion in damage but the bill is likely to rise as the scale of devastation becomes clearer.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group","header":"Bodies found as floods recede in India's Kerala","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:17:29.480Z"},"time":"\nPublished:\n  15:52 BST, 20 August 2018\n"}

Sharma said in a statement.The navy has rescued nearly 16,000 people in the state.The annual monsoon rains were already under way in Kerala when it was hit by torrential downpours beginning on August 8.The rains have decreased substantially and meteorologists are expecting light-to-moderate rains in coming days.Thousands of people have been leaving Kerala’s relief camps over the past two days, heading home to check on damage and begin the long process of cleaning up.“There was sludge and muck nearly up to my knee,” a dismayed Abdullah Aliyar said.The 65-year-old, who has been living with his family at a relief camp for more than a week, returned briefly to his nearby home Monday to find it uninhabitable and without drinking water or electricity.For now, the family of five will remain at Union Christian College, a sprawling campus on high ground just outside Kochi.It is one of more than 3,000 relief camps created amid the havoc of the floods.Volunteers at the camp estimate that up to 10,000 people were jammed into the schools’ buildings a week ago.Today, there are perhaps 1,500.“People are going home, or to their relatives’ homes,” said K.H. Shahabas, a local elected official who has been working in the camp since it was created.He said thousands of people poured into the college a few days after the floods began, when other low-lying relief camps were inundated.While water and electricity have returned to parts of Kerala, the state’s utilities were working to restore service to vast areas that still have no service, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.“In many areas the condition has improved wherein people can somehow return to their houses,” Kerala’s top elected official, Pinarayi Vijayan, said.“Water is receding in many places, but in some places it may take a little more time.”Mr Vijayan said 223 people had died in Kerala since August 8.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday \u0026 Metro Media Group","header":"Rescue operations scaled down as flood waters recede in...","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:18:59.479Z"},"time":"\nPublished:\n  11:33 BST, 21 August 2018\n"}

There are long queues at the school's few toilets and no bathroom to wash in.\"Everyone here is wearing the clothes they had when they escaped,\" she said, squeezed onto a jute mat with her husband, who works at a cashew factory in Kochi.In one classroom, Rasitha Sojith, from the nearby town of Kaprassery, sobbed as she told of how she escaped through chest-high waters carrying her two-month-old son.Sojith said water had burst into her home without warning last Wednesday while her father and sister with her three children were visiting to see the new baby.\"With water rising fast, we only grabbed a few clothes for the baby and went to the first-floor terrace of the neighbour's house,\" she said.Torrential rain fell for hours as their fear of being trapped mounted, until local fishermen rowed the family to safety the next day.\"Everything is lost. Everything! We don't even have money to go back to our neighbourhood,\" said Sojith.\"I don't think we will be leaving this camp any time soon.\"- Muddy rubble -An estimated 725,000 people are crammed into similar makeshift camps across Kerala.Authorities have given a provisional damage toll of $3 billion but the extent of the destruction is likely to prove much greater, some officials and legislators say.In the Malikampeedika area of Kochi, Mumthaz, who goes by one name, found the smell waiting for her when she returned to her home.\"This muddy rubble and stench is all that is left of our memories,\" Mumthaz told AFP, as she dragged out mud-caked mattresses and a sofa set, damaged utensils and even her daughters' school awards.As word spread of flood warnings, Mumthaz had taken her two daughters on Thursday to the home of her parents-in-law, in another neighbourhood.But floodwaters soon surged through their house as well and the whole family had to be rescued.\"It was surreal. The water was close to the knees at one point and within a few minutes it was touching five feet, with a current so strong that we saw big cars floating like tin cans,\" she said.With her husband searching for work in Dubai, Mumthaz knows she will struggle to look after her daughters, with the family facing an uncertain future after the nightmare of the floods.\"There is no kitchen, electricity and water here. I don't know how long it will take before I will be back...

Nadda said more than 3,500 medical camps were set up across a region roughly the size of Switzerland, where rains since Aug. 8 have swelled rivers and triggered landslides.\"There is a requirement for 90 different medicines and the first instalment has reached,\" he added.\"The biggest challenges immediately ahead are cleaning of the flood-hit houses, rehabilitation, and prevention of water-borne diseases,\" said Mahesh P., a village official in Rayamangalam, about 45 km (28 miles) from Kerala's financial capital of Kochi. Mahesh oversees four relief camps in his village, which itself escaped flood damage. The camps accommodate people rescued from neighbouring areas, which were among the worst affected.The villagers had all pulled together to rescue people and prevent an even bigger disaster, Mahesh said. \"The flood has bonded the people like never before, sharing whatever they had.\"Chlorine powder to disinfect water and other cleaning material are distributed by the camps Mahesh oversees, along with a basic survival kit consisting of a five-day supply of rice and food, toiletries and clothing.LONG QUEUESLight to moderate rain was expected across Kerala on Monday, promising respite to rescue workers, who have battled rising waters and mudslides to reach tens of thousands of stranded villagers.In one of the worst-hit areas, Chengannur, about 100 km (62 miles) from Kochi, a long queue of women snaked out of a medical camp at the main relief centre.As a helicopter hovered overhead, doctors checked elderly men and women lying on wooden benches in an engineering college.\"People are being screened for respiratory infections,\" said a camp doctor, Rajesh Parameshwaran, adding that another infection doctors were targeted was leptospirosis, which can strike people wading through stagnant water.Those returning home from the camps as the waters recede face a difficult clean-up job.The insides of many homes will have about 60 cm (24 inches) of mud, officials said. Wells, commonly used in Kerala, are contaminated and few places have electricity to pump water.Kochi's airport has suspended operations until Sunday due to waterlogging. National carrier Air India, on Monday began flying turboprop planes from the city's naval airport to the cities of Bangalore and Coimbatore in neighbouring states.To assist passengers, India's aviation regulator asked domestic airlines to cap maximum fares to and from Kerala and nearby airports.Kerala faces no shortage of food, as traders have stocked up ahead of the Hindu harvest festival of Onam on Saturday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.Kerala has cancelled all official celebrations of what is usually its biggest festive event.GRAPHIC - Map: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OKhKNtNATIONAL DISASTER?Even though Vijayan called the flood one of the worst in India's history, displacing more than half a million people, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not yet declared it a national disaster.State authorities say they are making a case for such a declaration, which prompts greater commitments of funds for relief and rebuilding efforts. But without a yardstick for such a declaration, it could be an uphill task.Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, urged Modi not to discriminate between states controlled by his Bharatiya Janata Party and those such as Kerala, which it does not rule.The state, ruled by the communist party, has received just a third of the immediate assistance of 20 billion rupees ($285 million) it sought from the federal government.

The India Meteorological Department forecast heavy rainfall in only one or two parts of Kerala on Sunday and withdrew a red alert in several districts. Using boats and helicopters, India's military led rescue efforts to reach people in communities cut off for days, with many trapped on roofs and upper floors, in desperate need of food and clean water.A Reuters photographer on a naval helicopter said water levels had receded in villages around the city of Kochi. Rescue teams were focused on the town of Chengannur on the banks of the Pamba River, where about 5,000 people are feared to be trapped, officials said.Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said the total number of people taking refuge at the 5,645 relief camps had risen to 725,000. Thirteen deaths were reported on Sunday, he added, taking the total number confirmed to nearly 200.Anil Vasudevan, who handles disaster management at Kerala's health department, said authorities had isolated three people with chickenpox in one of the relief camps in Aluva town, nearly 250 km (155 miles) from state capital Thiruvananthapuram.He said the department was preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of water-borne and air-borne diseases in the camps.DESTROYEDKerala, which usually receives high rainfall, has seen more than 250 percent more rain than normal between Aug. 8 and Aug. 15. State authorities have had to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into the main river.As the rain abated on Sunday morning, 60-year-old T P Johnny visited his home in Cheranelloor - a suburb of Kochi situated on the banks of the Periyar river - to see when he and his family could return.\"The entire house is covered with mud. It will take days to clean to make it liveable.

According to a lawmaker in Pathanamthitta district, some 10,000 people were stranded and in grave danger unless they were rescued urgently.A Reuters witness in Aluva town, nearly 250 km (155 miles)from Thiruvananthapuram, said army helicopters airlifted up to 14 marooned residents, including children and elderly people from an apartment.Joseph Moolakkaat, owner of an agricultural business, was trapped in a 10-storey block near the banks of the Periyar river in Aluva.

Not able to communicate from afternoon. Mobile phones are not reachable… Please help,” he added.Other distressed messages were shared online from people trapped inside temples and hospitals as well as their homes.More than 30 military helicopters and 320 boats are attempting rescues across Kerala after some areas were engulfed by overflowing rivers, with residents seen swimming and wading through chest-high waters past partially submerged houses.Authorities said thousands of people have been taken to safety so far but 6,000 more are still waiting for rescue.“We are deploying more boats and the army to ramp up rescue operations,” senior state government official P.H. Kurian told AFP.Helicopters have also been dropping emergency food and water supplies, while special trains carrying drinking water have been sent to Kerala.– ‘Extremely grave’ –According to India’s weather bureau, since the beginning of June more than 321 centimetres (126 inches) of rain has fallen on the hilly central district of Idukki, which is now virtually cut off from the rest of the state.The Kerala government has said it faces an “extremely grave” crisis and Vijayan warned of further torrential rainfall hitting the region over the weekend.The gates of dozens of dams and reservoirs across the state have been opened as water levels reach danger levels, inundating many other villages.At least 310,000 people have been displaced and are taking shelter in more than 2,000 relief camps.North and central Kerala have been worst-hit by the floods with the international airport in the main city of Kochi shut until at least August 26.The home ministry announced separately that 868 people have been reported dead in seven Indian states including Kerala since the start of the monsoon in June.EID-EL-ADHA, as it is being celebrated today by Muslims the world over, honours the monumental sacrifice that was to be...Seven-Up Bottling Company Limited (SBC) makers of 7Up, Pepsi, Mirinda, H2Oh, Teem, Mountain Dew and Aquafina have restat...2019 election: Between APC, PDP, others, who do you think will win?ENUGU—FORMER Senate minority leader, Obong Godswill Akpbio, has given a glimpse of the shape Nigeria’s 2019  general ele... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that “the nation’s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...MANY years ago, as a member of the Nigerian delegation to the Non-aligned Conference, I engaged a Nigerian vice-presiden...IN attendance at the enthronement were the deputy governor of Ondo state, Chief Agboola Ajayi, Ondo state Commissioner f...I WAS worried when I saw a presenter on a breakfast show engaging a senator during an interview session last week.The in...THE distinguished Ghanaian diplomat and international civil servant Kofi Annan passed away on Saturday 18 August in Bern...The Director General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, revealed, at a press briefing in Abuja on 15th August 2018 that Nigeria...","header":"More than 320 dead in India flood crisis","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:30:38.965Z"},"time":"\nTuesday 21 August\n"}

Look at my daughter, she was chosen too, one day she will become a great priestess,” she says enigmatically before retreating.Elsewhere, priestesses prepare offerings and sacrifices to the great goddess: a heady mixture of sacrificed chickens, ochre powder, potato chips and gin.Beating drums and the sound of shots from colonial-era rifles build to a crescendo. Soon tens of thousands of people are marching past.– Trances and kola nuts –\nCrowds accompany the Arugba, a virgin whose face is covered with a scarlet cloth embroidered with shells, to the river where the spirit of the water goddess lives.The wife of Sango, god of fire and thunder, once demanded a sacrifice to bring prosperity to the community, but today the virgin is just tasked with giving the offerings to the sacred river.On the riverbank, in the shade of century-old trees, a woman reads the future in kola nuts.One after another, women fall into a trance and have to be held back so that they do not drown in the river.It could all be a scene from another lifetime, were it not for the billboards advertising mobile phone services and other 21st-century wares.And yet belief in the Yoruba gods persists, unstifled by either successive Muslim jihads in the Sahel, Christian colonialists from Europe or, more recently, by evangelical pastors from Nigeria’s mega-churches.These Nigerian women will turn to the beautiful Osun to give them children.– Many gods –\n“Traditional religion has not been killed by modern religion because it is too deeply rooted among the Yoruba people to be destroyed,” said researchers Saskia Cousin and Jean-Luc Martineau in the academic journal Cahiers d’Etudes Africaines.“I’m Christian, Muslim and a traditionalist,” said Ayodele Folasade, an employee of the Osogbo museum.“I pray to Allah five times a day, I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ, but I also go to worship Osun by the river,” Folasade said.“Yoruba people say that if your prayers don’t work with one God try the other ones,” she said with a smile.“Pastors or imams say it’s not good to have many gods, but almost everybody turns to Osun when they need her,” said Folasade.Omitola Babaosha, a visitor to the festival, said he believed in the traditional gods but unlike others did not hide it.“I’m very proud of my heritage and I don’t care what people say about me,” said Babaosha, wearing a large white tunic.“Whoever you believe in, whatever your religion, at the end of the day you need water to survive,” he said.“There is no one on this earth who isn’t a child of Osun,” he said, hand in hand with his wife, walking in the crowd.“Going to the river to celebrate her spirit is like saying ‘thank you’ for the creation of nature.”EID-EL-ADHA, as it is being celebrated today by Muslims the world over, honours the monumental sacrifice that was to be...Seven-Up Bottling Company Limited (SBC) makers of 7Up, Pepsi, Mirinda, H2Oh, Teem, Mountain Dew and Aquafina have restat...2019 election: Between APC, PDP, others, who do you think will win?ENUGU—FORMER Senate minority leader, Obong Godswill Akpbio, has given a glimpse of the shape Nigeria’s 2019  general ele... Shareholders of RAK Unity Petroleum Company Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposal by its Board of Directors to pay...CLICK VIEW TO THE NEWSPAPER ARCHIVESThe report further explained that “the nation’s power generation plunged by 777.9 megawatts on Monday as output from the...MANY years ago, as a member of the Nigerian delegation to the Non-aligned Conference, I engaged a Nigerian vice-presiden...IN attendance at the enthronement were the deputy governor of Ondo state, Chief Agboola Ajayi, Ondo state Commissioner f...I WAS worried when I saw a presenter on a breakfast show engaging a senator during an interview session last week.The in...THE distinguished Ghanaian diplomat and international civil servant Kofi Annan passed away on Saturday 18 August in Bern...The Director General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, revealed, at a press briefing in Abuja on 15th August 2018 that Nigeria...","header":"Thousands celebrate Osun, goddess of fertility and water","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:32:14.917Z"},"time":"\nTuesday 21 August\n"}

Kurian, a top disaster management official in Kerala. He said weather conditions had improved considerably and expected the nearly 10,000 people still stranded to be rescued by Monday.An estimated 800 000 people were sheltered in some 4 000 relief camps across Kerala, Kurian said.Weather officials have predicted more rains across the state through Monday morning.The downpours that started August 8 have triggered floods and landslides and caused homes and bridges to collapse across Kerala, a picturesque state known for its quiet tropical backwaters and beautiful beaches.Officials estimate that more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) of roads have been damaged. One of the state's major airports, in the city of Kochi, was closed this past Tuesday due to the flooding. It is scheduled to remain closed until Aug. 26.The Indian government said a naval air base in Kochi will be opened for commercial flights starting Monday morning.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspected the flooded landscape from a helicopter on Saturday and met with the state's top officials, promising more than $70 million in aid.

Federal Health Minister JP Nadda said more than 3500 medical camps were set up across a region roughly the size of Switzerland, where rains since August 8 have swelled rivers and triggered landslides. “There is a requirement for 90 medicines and the first instalment has reached,” he added. “The biggest challenges immediately ahead are cleaning of the flood-hit houses, rehabilitation and prevention of water-borne diseases,” said Mahesh P, a village official in Rayamangalam, about 45km from Kerala's financial capital of Kochi. Mahesh oversees four relief camps in his village, which itself escaped flood damage. The camps accommodate people rescued from neighbouring areas, which were among the worst affected.

Luckily it was almost intact. He also had to bring with him the beloved birds that he had to leave behind.Tanimoto wants to go back there with his wife, Chieko, and their yellow and green parakeets, Pi-chan and Kyako-chan but said it would take a few weeks until they get the utility services back and clean the place.\"I can't go back if I wanted to,\" the 66-year-old retired Self-Defense serviceman said, holding a bird cage, in which the birds chirped as he spoke. \"Electricity is out, water is cut off and there is no information there.\"Rescuers were combing through mud-covered hillsides and along riverbanks Tuesday searching for dozens of people missing after heavy rains unleashed flooding and mudslides in southwestern Japan, where the death toll has exceeded 130.More than 50 people were unaccounted for as of Tuesday morning, many in the hardest-hit Hiroshima area. At Tanimoto's apartment complex, about a dozen victims have been found. He and his wife grabbed the minimum necessities and walked about 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) to a fire engine Sunday after the floods and mudslides hit the complex. Debris and mudslides had stopped right outside the couple's apartment door.He thinks he and his wife are the lucky ones. \"Some of our neighbours had their apartments destroyed, others are still looking for their families. So we are lucky. Our parakeets even survived,\" Tanimoto said.Work under the scorching sun was hampered by mud and heat, and shipments of relief goods were delayed by damaged roads and transportation systems, especially in areas isolated by the disaster.Residents sheltering at the Yano school were provided with water, blankets and cellphone chargers. But a local volunteer, Yuki Sato, 25, said local convenience stores were obviously in short supply, so she didn't buy anything there because she wanted to save them for the evacuees or others who can't drive out of town.Water and other relief supplies were scarce in some of the other disaster-hit areas.\"No water, food, nothing gets here,\" Ichiro Tanabe, a 73-year-old resident in the neighbouring port city of Kure, told the Mainichi newspaper. \"We are going to be all dried up if we continue to be isolated.\"Delivery companies Sagawa Express Co. and Yamato Transport Co. and cargo service Japan Freight Railway Co. said some of their shipments to and from the flooded areas have been suspended or reduced. Regional supermarket chains such as Every Co. said one outlet is closed and several other outlets shortened service hours due to delivery delays and supply shortage.Thousands of homes were still without clean water and electricity in Hiroshima and other hard-hit areas. Residents lined up for water under the scorching sun as temperatures rose to 35 Celsius (95 Fahrenheit), raising risks of heat stroke.In another hard-hit town, Ozu in Ehime prefecture, water supplies were entirely cut off and residents could not clean their mud-stained homes or even their clothes. At a major supermarket in town, employees sold bottled water and tea, cups of noodles and other preserved foods that survived the floods, while employees cleaned damaged merchandise, throwing items into dozens of plastic bags.The landslides and flooding across much of western Japan have killed at least 134 people, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. Another seven were presumed dead.Some of the thousands of residents who had been evacuated, some rescued from their rooftops, began cleaning up after the rain stopped Monday.Suga said the government set up a task force and was spending 2 billion yen ($18 million) to hasten deliveries of supplies and other support for evacuation centres and residents in the region.Earlier Tuesday, the Self-Defense Force ferried seven oil trucks from Hiroshima to Kure, a major industrial city whose 226,000 residents were cut off from the rest of the prefecture due to the disaster.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a planned July 11-18 trip to Europe and the Middle East to oversee the emergency response. The government mobilized 75,000 troops and emergency workers and nearly 80 helicopters for the search and rescue effort, Suga said.Assessment of the casualties was slowed by the scale of the area affected. Officials in Ehime prefecture asked the government to review its weather warning system, noting that rain warnings were issued after damage and casualties already had occurred. The Japan Meteorological Agency said as much as 10 centimetres (3 inches) of rain per hour fell on large parts of southwestern Japan.APScience fiction gets real with Mercedes' digital lightsMourners’ shock: too fat to be crematedWorldVentures sued for millions by repsHawks raid Malema bodyguard's Durban office for gunsHundreds jobless as Afro Worldview is taken off airSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"LOOK: Rescuers comb through mud for victims of flood which left 134 dead","parent_keyword":"kerala floods","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-21T20:35:22.396Z"},"time":"Tue 21 Aug"}

Her 72-year-old spouse died in a cloudburst in the nearby village of Bastari.She now lives alone, while her two sons work in New Delhi.“The rain didn’t stop, even for a minute.\nThunderous lightning made us deaf all through the night,” she said.The following day at about four in the morning, a neighbour woke the villagers, calling them to help save a family from the deluge.As everyone gathered, there was a huge explosion. Dust and debris flew in the air. The rain continued unabated.“It was as if a bomb went off,” said Haruli Devi, wiping her tears with an end of her sari. “Pillars came out from houses. A huge surge of water came down from above, carrying boulders, engulfing trees, houses and people.”The state government announced that nine people had died, they had been submerged in the soil along with their houses. They were never found.“The soil was like quicksand that sucked them along with it,” said Haruli Devi.Since that day, Bastari has become known as a “ghost village”.Disaster management officials declared the land uninhabitable and relocated 24 families to Singhali.The government compensated Haruli Devi $6 200 for her husband’s death and gave her $4 700 to build a new house in Singhali.But the cost of constructing the house was higher — $15 600 — a sum she arranged with the help of bank loans and money from relatives.She now lives on a monthly widow’s pension of $15.The land she owned in Bastari, on which she grew vegetables to feed the family, is now barren. She remembers a spring where enough water for everyone in the village could be drawn.Now, in Singhali, she buys water from the government.She is one of five Bastari women who lost their husbands in the landslide.“We are now turned into a life of nonexistence for society,” said Haruli Devi.A man who lost his entire family in the same disaster has now remarried, she said.“Men are allowed to do everything. It’s easy for them.”Two days before tragedy struck in Uttarakhand, the Meteorological Department had warned of heavy rainfall and flash floods.The state recorded more than 100 millimetres of rainfall in just two hours on July 1, leaving 48 people dead in the districts of Pithoragarh and Chamoli.Natural disasters in the state kill dozens every year.Cloudbursts, landslides and floods are common, and large companies are often called in to manage evacuation and rescue efforts.Extreme rainfall, geological scientists have warned, weakens the mountains.Meanwhile, construction in the hills in the name of development has also increased the number of casualties and amount of damage.According to disaster management officials, more than 800 people died in the state from 2010 to 2017 due to events triggered by heavy rainfall. Hundreds of people have been injured or gone missing.But this death toll doesn’t include the flash floods of June 2013, which killed more than 5 700 people and wiped away entire villages.Locals who survived the floods disputed the official number, saying more than 15 000 people died.Piyoosh Rautela, who heads Uttarakhand’s disaster mitigation and management department, said the state is witnessing the fury of climate change.“There will be phases of severe rainfall in years to come. We are aware of the vulnerable zones and, we know, sooner or later, landslides will strike at these places,” Rautela told Al Jazeera.Women suffer most in the aftermath of a disaster, and those from unprivileged castes face further exclusion with limited access to resources.The 2013 catastrophe left hundreds of women alone, after their husbands and sons died.The district of Rudraprayag alone has 296 widows. In some sections of Indian society, widows are discouraged from leaving their houses or meeting people.Rita Devi* is from the village of Deoli-Bhanigram, home to 32 widows. She was six months pregnant when her husband, a priest, died.“Widows like us are cursed. We bring shame to the family,” she said, explaining that she rarely gets a good night’s sleep on account of her anxiety about the future.“Being a widow is difficult. Who will look after my son? I have no income. When I am alone, some men make dirty remarks at me,” she continued.A recent graduate, she is now studying for a master’s degree. She wants a government job in the city, where she believes she won’t be labelled as cursed.Sitting with her mother-in-law, she said: “Remarrying is a taboo in the community of upper-castes. If I get a job, I can spend the life with my son. At least I wouldn’t be a burden to this family.“Most of the compensation she received after the disaster has dried up.Deoli-Bhanigram is known as Uttarakhand’s “village of widows”.Several non-profit organisations attempted to support the women of Deoli-Bhanigram after the June 2013 floods, providing them with work to become self-sufficient.Ranjana Devi, another widow, is among those who received help. She now works at Mandakini Women Weavers in Deoli-Bhanigram as a handloom weaver, earning a monthly salary of $28.She used the compensation money for her daughter’s marriage and looks after her two sons, one of whom is physically disabled.“God willing, my sons and I will survive,” she said.Another NGO, Sulabh International Social Service Organisation, paid $31 a month to disaster-affected families for three years.Sewing machines and flour mills were also distributed to some women.However, NGOs and the government offered little assistance to women outside Deoli-Bhanigram.Rautela argued that the state government’s budget was limited.“We don’t have enough funds for counselling and rehabilitation efforts of disaster-impacted people, especially women. Our work ends when the disaster ends,” he said.The struggling women, who say the state government had promised them jobs, are left to deal with the prospect of more unpredictable weather and an uncertain future.“We aren’t their vote banks,” said Rita Devi, commenting on the lack of support from the state government. “We don’t feature in their policies.” — Al Jazeera*Not her real name.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

As many as 87 people have been reported killed and another 130 are feared buried in landslides, according to authorities and news reports.Troops were deployed after the sudden rains—measuring up to 94,4cm in one day in suburban Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra state—stranded tens of thousands of people.“Most places in India don’t receive this kind of rainfall in a year.\nThis is the highest ever recorded in India’s history,” said RV Sharma, director of the meteorological department in Mumbai. “We have to compare it with world records to find out if this was the highest in the world.”At least 62 people died in Maharashtra and southern Kerala state in weather-related tragedies on Tuesday.On Wednesday, at least 25 people drowned after being trapped in cars or crushed by falling walls, said Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the state’s top elected official.“Twenty-five to 30 people were killed in Bombay. The situation is very grave,” he was quoted as saying on the website Rediff.com.He said the deaths included seven children killed in a landslide in suburban Mumbai’s Andheri district.Early on Wednesday, he ordered a two-day holiday and called the army, navy and home guards to help with relief.“Inflatable rafts will be used to reach stranded people. Please try to stay where you are and don’t leave your homes,” he said.The state-run All India Radio reported about 150 000 people were stranded in railway stations across Mumbai.Roads were choked all night as tens of thousands of people were stranded, and the two main highways were inundated. The domestic and international airports in Mumbai, among the busiest in the country, have been shut down since Tuesday evening, and all incoming flights are being diverted to New Delhi and other airports.India’s previous heaviest rainfall, recorded at Cherrapunji in the north-eastern Meghalaya state—one of the rainiest places on Earth—was 83,82cm on July 12 1910, Sharma said.“Never before in Mumbai’s history has this happened,” said Mumbai’s police Commissioner AN Roy. “Our first priority is to rescue people stranded in floods.”State police reported new landslides in Maharashtra’s Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, and Kolhapur areas. Details weren’t immediately available.Rescuers started arriving on Tuesday night in Kondivali village, 150km south of Mumbai, hoping to extricate nearly 100 people trapped there, said police officer S Jadav.

Blankets dry on iron gates in the Pretoria township and shoes absorb the sun’s heat on the roofs of shacks.The russet water streams past number 251, Rose Makua’s house.\nSeven people live in this stuffy dark shack: Makua, her husband, her mother-in-law, her son-in-law and her three children.This weekend, water released from a rain-swollen dam nearby seeped into the shack and rose thigh-high, soaking belongings and warping the stove and wardrobe.The flooding is not on the same scale as those in KwaZulu-Natal, which killed 20 people earlier this month, but it is a source of misery for a poor household, nonetheless.Makua points out a bucket filled with her family’s ruined shoes. “Now none of us has shoes to wear,” she says. A broken foam mattress is perched over the fence to dry out. “The babies were sleeping on the floor,” she explains.Her first born is 17 years old and suffers from asthma. She has been sent to live with relatives because her condition is aggravated by living in the shack.Makua has lived at number 251 for more than 15 years and this is the second bout of flooding she has experienced. “But this time, it was really terrible.”8490 shacks hit\nHers is just one of 8 490 shacks hit by the flooding in Mamelodi as a result of heavy rains on December 19 and again in early January.Across South Africa, in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and the North West, floods caused by heavy summer rains have caused massive damage to households and have claimed at least 32 lives.A statement released by the department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs on Wednesday said the total damage was yet to be assessed.Information from hard-hit communities is still being coordinated by the department’s National Disaster Management Centre.However, the statement said that up to 500 houses could have been damaged in Gauteng and that 12 people had died in the province. In KwaZulu-Natal about 200 households have been affected, 20 people have lost their lives and nine have been seriously injured.Last week CNN reported that at least 50 people had died after floods in the Eastern Cape and hundreds more had been made homeless. And on Wednesday the Sowetan reported that four people were believed to have drowned in Limpopo and six in Mpumalanga.Makua and other residents of Mamelodi gathered on the dirt road to collect handouts from the Gift of the Givers Foundation, which is providing food, hygiene and household detergent packages, as well as sweet packs for children, blankets, new clothing and shoes.Back from helping out in Ladysmith and Newcastle this week, Allauddin Sayed, Gift of the Givers manager across five provinces, said that the conditions in KwaZulu-Natal were far more severe than those in Pretoria.Bridges collapsed\n“Houses were literally washed away,” he said, while bridges had collapsed, cutting communities off from the outside world, and roofs were blown off new brick homes.Sayed said one family he had visited in Ladysmith had lost a child to pneumonia—aggravated by the wet and cold.Ester Ramogale, the function head for disaster management in the eastern region of Tshwane, said the effect of the flooding in Mamelodi was exacerbated by the growth of informal settlements.“The Mamelodi area is growing rapidly,” Ramogale said. “It’s mainly informal structures. [People] settle in areas where they have been advised not to build.”Ramogale said preventative measures included the distribution of flyers containing warnings to residents about living in low-lying areas. Awareness campaigns were carried out in winter and schools, particularly, were targeted.People tolerate such conditions, Ramogale said, because “they are waiting to be moved to RDP housing”.Makua is bitter because, although she was given a deed for an RDP house in 2004, a councillor told her that the house does not exist. She still hopes her RDP house will materialise. “The councillor must make it happen,” she says.The cooperative governance and traditional affairs department told the Mail \u0026 Guardian that it plays a role in various aspects of damage management by providing support to affected communities, working in cooperation with civil society bodies and providing funds for the rebuilding of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and houses.The South African Weather Service has warned of more heavy rains and possible flooding in several provinces at the weekend.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

According to environmentalists, the committee's recommendations were strong enough to protect the sensitive Western Ghat region.The committee had suggested that 140,000 kilometres of the Western Ghats be classified in three zones as per the requirement of environmental protection in the areas. In some areas the committee recommended strong restrictions on mining and quarrying, use of land for non-forest purposes, construction of high rises etc. The report was first submitted to the government in 2011.But the Kerala government rejected the committee report and did not adopt any of its recommendations.Speaking to various regional media, Madhav Gadgil has said that irresponsible environmental policy is to blame for the recent floods and landslides in Kerala. He also called it a \"manmade calamity\". He said that the committee report had recommended to protect the resources with the cooperation of local self governments and people, but those recommendations were rejected. He also pointed out that quarrying is a major reason for the mudslides and landslides.Other environmentalists also point fingers at the extensive quarrying, mushrooming of high rises as part of tourism and illegal forest land acquisition by private parties as major reasons for the recent calamity.With nearly three quarters of a million people packed into relief camps in the southern state, known for its tourist beaches and hill resorts, authorities also fear outbreaks of disease.After a week of fierce downpours, rainfall eased Monday and flood levels have fallen in many districts.

He isn’t shirking from wading through muck-riddled waters and plucking those stranded in water-logged homes in his native district Thrissur in Central Kerala.When Gulf News tracked him over phone on Monday morning in his native hometown, he was on day four of rescue mission and was battling a nasty bout of fungal skin infection, triggered by him constantly being in water-logged streets. He’s also one of the few stars who opened the doors of his family home in Irinjalakkuda and urged those trapped in floods to take temporary shelter there. His close friends and their families are currently camping down there.“Now the situation is slightly OK. Rescue is almost over as we have managed to cart majority of the residents into relief camps. Now our next step is to rehabilitate them into their ravaged homes,” said Thomas, who has been constantly uploading videos on their collective rescue mission.Since he was working on the grounds, he also highlighted the realities facing volunteers who were trying to help the flood survivors to safety.A recent video uploaded on his Facebook account saw him drenched to the bone, pleading with his neighbours in water-logged homes seeking refuge on their terraces. He explained that shifting to relief camps, no matter how rich and privileged your existence, is the most pragmatic solution during a natural disaster like the floods as help may not reach them once the volunteer leave.According to reports, around 22,000 people were rescued from flood-hit areas in Kerala on Sunday and more than 350 people have been killed in landslides triggered by monsoons. Tovino chronicled his last week’s trying experiences as his life’s biggest lesson in humanity coming together to stay afloat.“It all started when I heard that water had flooded my friend’s home. I went to pick them but then I realised how bad the situation is. This is my first experience of such intense rains. Even my father’s generation had not witnessed such flood. So, we are just learning on the job … I am not alone in my efforts,” said Thomas. He recounts how students from Christ College, who have their families in worst-hit areas such as Wayanad, are staying back magnanimously to help in rescue and relief efforts.According to the actor, who has played a variety of roles in hits such as ABCD and Ennum Ninte Moideen, the need of the hour now is financial help.\"What I am seeing is that we have rescued and put them in relief camps. The food is ok without any problem. What we need is that we need to rehabilitate them into their homes. Lot of people have lost their livelihoods. Many traders have lost their shops and those who lived livestock have lost their cows. This was their means of livelihood. To bring them back to normalcy isn’t easy. Every malayali around the world and the non-malayalis need to just put in Rs1 [Dh 0.05] and it will still help.”But is there a silver lining in the face of such mass destruction by nature?“Kerala floods is a natural calamity but we have collectively stood together to overcome it. No matter what happens to us from now on, we will stand with our chests puffed and face it with strength. The bond between us all have strengthened. We are one big happy family.”Tovino Thomas, 29, was born in a Catholic family in Irinjalakkuda in Kerala. He is a former model who graduated from Tamil Nadu College of Engineering and is a qualified software engineer. However, the industry-outsider with no film dynasty backing him realised that his true calling is acting.He made his Malayalam film debut in 2012 with Prabhuvinte Makkal directed by Sajeevan Anthikad. But he could get his feet into the door after acting in a string of films such as Ennu Ninte Moideen, Charlie and ABCD. But the turning point in his career was Guppy in 2016. He topped up his career with hits including Godha and Oru Mexican Aparatha last year.But his biggest hit was the romantic drama, Mayaanadhi, which saw him play an endearing lover who’s in love with an aspiring actress. It was a blockbuster that made him a household name. According to critics, his appeal stems from his friendly demeanour that makes him perfect for guy-next-door roles.He is married to his childhood sweetheart Lidiya and has a daughter. Malayalam actress and fashion designer and TV Poornima Indrajith, who has been active in Kerala flood relief efforts, urged the Central government to declare the rain-ravaged calamity as a ‘national disaster’ to help the rain-ravaged state limp back to normalcy.“Kudos to the Kerala government and all the civilians who have managed to run things even without the Central government’s support so far … But when it comes to grass-roots reality, we need their [Central Government]  support,” said Indrajith in an interview with Gulf News.For the past ten days, Poornima and her actor-husband Indrajith and two daughters have been camping at the Rajeev Gandhi Sports Centre (RSC) in Kochi, which has been transformed into a massive collection centre for relief items under the NGO, Anbodu Kochi. “We weren’t ready for such rains … it was like an attack because all of us were just expecting to celebrate Onam … When a natural calamity hits you, you may at first feel like you can overcome it. But this one has hit us so hard … it was like our carpet being pulled away from our feet,” said Indrajith. She isn’t alone in helping rebuild Kerala after massive floods, which has claimed 350 people and forced its residents to seek refuge in temporary relief camps. Singer- actor Vineeth Srinivasan said the need of the hour is to provide sanitation and food.“Any contribution of the Gulf Malayalis to the CM’s relief fund will be of great help to those who have been affected. Malayalis in the GCC can also guide them about the need to work on their insurance claims,” said Sreenivasan.The Jimmiki Kamal composer Shaan Rahman dubbed the floods as the biggest disaster to have hit Kerala.“People are slowly going back to their homes now. Now what is required is cleaning materials … These flood were the biggest display of humanity coming together,” said Rahman to Gulf News. Max - 36 °CMin - 28 °CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAETrump offers condolences to SaudisKerala flood: Kochi airport to open 'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

More than 350 people have been killed since the monsoon hit the state on May 29. But the toll would have been higher had the Keralites in the state not rallied around admirably to rescue hundreds of thousands of people stranded in their homes. Dams’ sluice gates had to be opened as water levels rose to dangerous levels, adding to the woes wrought by 11 days of heavy rains.The Kerala diaspora too responded swiftly, dispatching funds and relief material to help their relatives, friends and strangers affected by the deluge. Almost all community organisations of Keralites in the UAE have set up centres around the emirates to collect relief material. Food, medicine, clothes, blankets and other aid material have been shipped to the state. The exchange houses too have weighed in by forgoing commission for payments remitted to the Kerala Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund.The UAE leadership, in keeping with the spirit of giving, lent their support, urging citizens and expatriates to pitch in help the flood victims ahead of Eid Al Adha. President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s move to set up a national emergency committee gave momentum to the UAE’s emergency relief campaign in Kerala.The rising waters may have brought the state to its knees, but it failed to break the spirit of its people. Roads and bridges have been washed away. But fisherfolk and people from all walks of life have put themselves at risk to save the lives of others. Indian mainstream media have been accused of turning a blind eye to Kerala’s suffering. But social media rose to the occasion. The networks have been filled with not just messages of support, but also offers of shelter and food to the flood-affected. In a state, where trolling is a favourite pastime, people have come together to harness the positive power of social media to help find the people stuck on rooftops and direct boats and helicopters to pluck them to safety.The people of Kerala have to be applauded for the way they pulled together to tide over the fury of the rain. Religion, caste, creed or social status didn’t matter. The will to live overcame all social barriers, and the willingness to help was heartwarming.

That is when Jaisal decided to bend down in the water and stay on all fours, letting the women step on his back and board the boat, one by one. One of the women did so, carrying her child.The social media was soon praising Jaisal’s wholehearted service to the flood-hit and a few hundred thousand had watched the video within a few hours.Dozens of Kerala fishermen from Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam districts who rushed to help in the rescue operations following floods in the state, have won the praise of the state government, which has decided to compensate them, too.The fishermen had turned heroes on social media, too, for their commitment to the rescue operations. On hearing about the floods, the fishermen had loaded their boats into trucks and rushed to places like Ranni and Chengannur to help with the rescue efforts.They worked side by side with India’s armed forces, taking their fishing boats through the by-lanes in towns and country-sides of Kerala, which had turned watery paths for them.Interestingly, many of the fishermen are themselves victims of the recent Ockhi cyclone which had devastated their own lives.While the social media gave them a big salute, state chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the fishermen would be provided free fuel for their boats and Rs 3,000 per day for their efforts in the rescue operations.The state government has also offered to compensate them for whatever damage their boats have suffered in the rescue work. Many boats had hit the walls of houses while making tough navigation through the by-lanes in various towns in their attempt to rescue people stranded in their homes.Max - 36 °CMin - 28 °CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAETrump offers condolences to SaudisKerala flood: Kochi airport to open 'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The Cochin International Airport has been shut until August 26 after the runway was submerged, according to airport authorities.Train services in several parts of the state have also been suspended because of landslides and flash floods, according to a Twitter post by Southern Railway.“Tourism is completely out of gear,” Pronab Sarkar, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, said by telephone. “Rescue operations for existing tourists are going on and no fresh tourists are bring sent at the moment.”The floods will have an adverse impact until the middle of September, Sarkar said. Tourism accounts for about 10 per cent of Kerala’s gross domestic product, with the state welcoming about one million foreign tourists last year and 14.7 million local visitors.The natural disaster could mean a loss of tourism income for an entire season while the state rebuilds itself, said Abhijit Sen, a New Delhi-based economist. “But this is also a wake-up call for India to plan better in the long run to help adapt for extreme climate change events.”Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAETrump offers condolences to SaudisKerala flood: Kochi airport to open 'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The Abu Dhabi committee of the KMCC has committed to raise Rs5 million (Dh263,141), he said. People can submit relief materials at various KMCC offices across the UAE, Rahman said.He said all community organisations in Fujairah emirate, led by Indian Social Club and KMCC, are also sending one container of relief materials on Sunday.SharjahThe Indian Association — Sharjah (IAS) has started collecting materials and many non-Indians have also come forward to help. “An Iraqi man contributed 10 bags of rice on Friday,” said Abdullah Mallachery, general secretary of the IAS.He said the association has announced Rs2.5 million to the Kerala Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund (CMDRF) and Rs500,000 has already been given.Abu DhabiThe Kerala Social Centre (KSC) in Abu Dhabi collected 1.5 tonnes of relief materials in the last two days, which include 1,000 blankets, said Saleem Cholamukath, auditor and media coordinator at the KSC. He said the KSC and Abu Dhabi Shakthi Theatres, a cultural organisation, will continue to collect the materials and encourage their members to contribute to the chief minister’s relief fund.Abu Dhabi Malayalee Samajam (ADMS) has already collected one container of materials in coordination with various other community groups, said T.A. Nazer, president of ADMS. A meeting of all community groups on Saturday night at the ADMS will discuss and decide the further action plans to step up relief efforts, he said.The Indian Social Centre (ISC) and the Indian Ladies Association (ILA) will also open collection points at their respective offices from Sunday.Businesses supportUAE-based businesses are continuing their donations for Kerala flood victims.Dr K.P. Hussain, chairman, Fathima Healthcare Group, has announced Rs50 million for relief efforts in Kerala.

Second is not to send relief materials because everything is available in the state or in the neighbouring states,” the envoy explained.As of now, enough supplies are there to handle the situation, he said.\"Receiving materials that are not required will create complications to the state government. It will cause unnecessary distraction, as the government has to devote their resources to store and sort out the goods for distribution, Suri said.Moreover, sending money will help rebuild the local economy, apart from providing emergency relief, he told Gulf News.“It is quite clear when you send cash, and people spend that cash by buying goods and services from the local economy, it will provide stimulus when things are slow. So it makes sense to send cash and spending that cash locally within Kerala so that it generates more jobs and economic growth,” the diplomat said.As Gulf News reported on Monday, an Emirati official also said it was more important to send money to Kerala, so supplies could be bought from markets close to the flood-affected areas.Fahd Abdul Rahman Bin Sultan, deputy secretary-general for international aid affairs at Emirates Red Crescent (ERC), pointed out that it was more expensive, and logistically more complicated, to send relief martials by air — sometimes the cost of cargo is higher than the cost of the items being sent.The ambassador said there was no need to look at Kerala as an isolated place. Kerala is one of India’s most developed states; it is certainly India’s best-educated state. It is also surrounded by the reasonably well-developed states — Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The envoy explained that if there is a shortage in Kerala’s Palakkad, Wayanad or Kannur districts, it could easily be sourced from major cities within around 50 miles, such as Coimbatore, Mysore and Mangalore.“When you have big cities in the neighbourhood, there is no shortage of materials in India. Rather than going through the expense and efforts of collecting materials in the UAE, then finding ways to send them to Kerala’s airports and then sending it from there, it makes sense to send money,” the ambassador explained.It may be easy to send goods from the UAE to Kerala’s airports but transporting them further from there will be a tough task because of damaged roads, he said.The envoy appreciated the initiative of major money exchange houses in the UAE to facilitate free-of-cost remittance to the Chief Minister’s relief fund and urged everyone to utilise it.Suri said people’s emotional urge to do something tangible during a crisis is understandable. “Creating a box of items is more satisfying than wiring the money. But the fact is that wiring the money is far more efficient and rational.”Moreover, other Indian states are also sending relief goods to Kerala, he said.■ Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has requested the Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) to extend their support to the state to deal with the worst natural calamity it has ever faced. ■ People can send their donations to CMDRF (Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund), Account number: 67319948232, State Bank of India, City Branch, Thiruvananthapuram, IFS Code: SBIN0070028. Max - 36 °CMin - 28 °CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Two Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAETrump offers condolences to SaudisKerala flood: Kochi airport to open 'Wake-up call': Manila runway shutdown GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Heavier than usual monsoon rains have submerged most parts of the state, which has issued alerts for many districts.The UAE community — the leadership, humanitarian organisations, government entities, residents, and businesses — has stepped forward to support the people of Kerala.If you are in the UAE, there are easy ways to donate for Kerala relief: (see the table below right)On Sunday, Bin Sultan said: “As you know, the order to support the people of Kerala has come from President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to all humanitarian organisations. The leader will be ERC for international aid from the UAE.”He added: “We’re coordinating with all the humanitarian organisations, Indian societies and associations, and businesses to collect stocks and money — and to share information on the same ­— to support Kerala.”Bin Sultan said it was more important to send money to Kerala, so food and other supplies could be bought from markets close to the flood-affected areas. He pointed out that it was more expensive, and logistically more complicated, to send in-kind relief by air — sometimes the cost of cargo is higher than the cost of the items being sent.“We [ERC] are working on the ground in Kerala. Our employees and volunteers are coordinating with the UAE consulate in Kerala and the government of Kerala. We have given directives to the consulate to buy food from the area there. We have collected items and we also have items already in stock.”The relief will be flow from the UAE to Kerala in a few days, Bin Sultan added, after the go-ahead from the UAE and Kerala, considering the weather and on-ground situation in Kerala. Also, an ERC delegation will be going to Kerala soon, he said.When asked about the total amount of funds and items for the Kerala relief effort, Bin Sultan said that the collection of funds and items is still an ongoing process.He added that the response from the UAE community has been strong, citing Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation (KBZF), which alone received Dh10 million, as an example.On Sunday, KBZF said the contributions started pouring in only hours after it launched an emergency relief campaign to assist the Kerala flood victims in line with the directives of the UAE leadership.ERC, established in 1983, is the leading humanitarian organisation of the UAE.Dubai ■ Kerala Muslim Cultural  Committee (KMCC) office: Call 04-2727773  to connect with volunteers at their offices in Al Baraha behind Dubai Hospital ■ Kerala NRI Cell and Indian Assist: Contact Chandra Prakash for Kerala NRI Cell on 0555653719 or on email : chandridxb@gmail.comSharjah ■ Indian Association Sharjah — 06-5610845Abu Dhabi ■ The Indian Social and Cultural Centre (ISC) — 02-6730066■ Indian Ladies Association (ILA) — 02-6330182■ The Kerala Social Centre —  02-6314455 ■ The Abu Dhabi Malayalee Samajam, Musaffah —  02-5537600■ The Indian Islamic Centre in Abu Dhabi — 02-6424488Fujairah ■ Indian Social Club —  09-2221155 ■ Bedsheets, sleeping mats, blankets, nighties, lungi, bathing towels, rusk (no bread), biscuits (no cream biscuits), water, rice, sugar, salt, milk powder, pulses, oil, spices, tea/coffee powder, electrolytes, water purifying chlorine, tablets, Dettol, first aid kits, mosquito repellents, anti-septic lotion, antifungal powder, bleaching powder/lime powder, baby diapers, adult diapers, sanitary napkins, toothpaste, toothbrushes, bathing soap, washing soap, candles, matchboxes, cooking utensils and dining utensils like plates, tumblers etc, basic household furniture (chairs, tables etc), containers for storing rice and other food items at home, footwear, mugs and buckets.■ Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has requested the Non-Resident Keralites (NRKs) to extend their support to the state to deal with the worst natural calamity it has ever faced. ■ People can send their donations to CMDRF (Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund), Account number: 67319948232, State Bank of India, City Branch, Thiruvananthapuram, IFS Code: SBIN0070028. div.success {padding:0 20px; background-color: #eff1e2; border-top: 6px solid#637a86; width=\"100%\"}■ Yousuf Ali, chairman and MD of LuLu Group, donated a total of Dh9.23 million. ■ Dr B.R.

IT’S the secret plan senior public servants have drawn up that is causing fear and anger in Britain.The so-called Doomsday scenario has been devised by staff working for the Brexit Secretary David Davis - and it predicts Mad Max-style anarchy if the UK leaves the European Union next year without a deal in place.Medicine, food and fuel would become scarce within a fortnight according to the worst-case scenario, with a key port in Dover becoming unworkable on the first day of Brexit, leading to severe shortages across the country.That option is considered at the extreme limit of where Brexit could end, and it has caused considerable alarm among Brits who are already weary over the divorce process from the EU that is growing more complicated by the day.According to a report in The Sunday Times, chartered aircraft would have to be used to get supplies where they were needed.“You would have to medivac medicine into Britain, and at the end of week two we would be running out of petrol as well,” the paper quoted a government source.“In the second scenario, not even the worst, the port of Dover will collapse on day one. The supermarkets in Cornwall and Scotland will run out of food within a couple of days, and hospitals will run out of medicines within two weeks,” the Times reported.The plans were drawn up for ministers to read at special weekly meetings and were considered so damaging only a small number of Theresa May’s government had seen them.The rest of the time the plans were “locked in a safe”, the source said.Brexit planners have denied the doomsday scenario would ever happen - at least officially - but conceded the discussions had taken place.Britain wants to strike a deal on future trade relations with the EU before it officially leaves the bloc on March 29 next year, but officials are also drawing up plans for negotiations ending without an agreement - which is where the doomsday and other scenarios come in.If it left without a deal it would trade on World Trade Organisation terms.The unknown factors are how EU countries would respond.The plans emerged as the Brexit negotiations reach a critical point and with a number of major obstacles blocking the way. Pro-Brexit supporters have accused those who favour staying in the EU of deliberately spreading fear. It also comes at a time Prime Minister May is under massive pressure to secure the best possible deal for Britain.It won’t be easy - she is not only battling the EU and her counterparts in Europe, but members of her own party are growing restless and a minor party that keeps her in power has begun flexing its muscles.National newspapers have also called on her to stand aside if she cannot deliver a good Brexit outcome.One of the main issues complicating Brexit is the differences of opinion over whether a “hard” or “soft” Brexit should be pursued.A hard exit would see Britain able to sign its own free trade deals - and Australia is one of the countries it is interested in - but a soft exit would see the country form a customs partnership with the EU. One option is where the UK would act on the EU’s behalf when goods arrived in the UK that are intended for the EU. The reverse would happen for goods arriving in the EU destined for the UK.That would seriously reduce Britain’s ability to strike new trade deals - one of the key factors of Brexit, and it’s not clear even if that is workable.A second option is known as maximum facilitation and aims to streamline the border process, using technology to remove physical customs checks.A big sticking point though is some of the systems could take years to implement.Then there is the problem of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - the only land border between the EU and the UK.Both sides want to keep the border open, but it’s unclear how that is practical.The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, has warned that her party will withdraw its support for the May Government if Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK.She told Sky News: “For us, our only red line is that we are not treated any different from the rest of the United Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market which, of course, is Great Britain.”A further flashpoint in the Brexit process is fast approaching. Cabinet ministers will meet soon to decide which customs option they should seek from the EU, and then Mrs May will meet EU leaders at the end of the month to update them on the plan.Before she even gets there though, the Prime Minister has to make it through a crucial vote in parliament when the EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the House of Commons.MPs are expected to vote on the bill next week, and Mrs May will hope that 15 amendments imposed by the unelected upper house will be defeated. If they aren’t, and her government suffers a parliamentary defeat, then her own leadership could be under threat.As well as leaving the EU customs union and the Irish border question, also at stake is what power parliament has if the government’s exit deal is rejected.Some commentators are already predicting the day of the vote will be the most dramatic in a generationAnd for someone who became Prime Minister as a direct result of Brexit, that truly would be doomsday scenario.The Doomsday Clock is a theoretical indicator of how close humanity is to a doomsday event. Started in 1947, the board of scientists who decide what the clock says has included Einstein, Oppenheimer and is now chaired by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss.andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

He’s the only politician in history who posed while signing his own resignation letter, that tells you everything you need to know about him,” deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said.Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, added: “It’s always all about Boris Johnson with him.”A scathing old tweet from Mr Johnson’s former newspaper editor Max Hastings has also resurfaced.In his resignation letter, the one he is proudly pictured with, Mr Johnson accused Mrs May of surrendering to European Union negotiators as the UK plans to leave the bloc: “What is even more disturbing is this is our opening bid...It is as though we are sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering above them.”Mr Johnson, a flamboyant former journalist and London Mayor, had taken issue with Mrs May’s proposal for the UK to leave the EU next year.He feared it was a “soft” Brexit that betrayed the millions who voted to leave the EU and that would see the country still tied.She replied tersely that she was “sorry and a little surprised” at his view considering he supported it just days earlier. She then added that it was “right that you should step down”.Mrs May has faced a backlash over her plan for the UK when the country leaves the EU in March next year.As well as Mr Johnson, Brexit Secretary David Davis quit her government and now there are calls for her to go as well.No leadership challenge has emerged yet, but several British media reports suggest backbenchers could be waiting until President Trump has visited this week to deliver their demands she resign.Mrs May has indicated she would fight any moves to blast her from Downing St.HARD BREXIT VS SOFT BREXIT: WHAT IT MEANSThe current crisis has been threatening to explode for months, as Mrs May has fought with colleagues within her Conservative party and Cabinet as well as EU counterparts to chart a course for Britain post-Brexit.Conservative politicians have been divided about what sort of Brexit to go for - a so called “soft Brexit” or a “hard Brexit”.A hard Brexit is what is favoured by Brexit supporters. It would see the UK leave the single market and customs union when they leave the EU, meaning London would once again fully control its borders, stopping the flow of EU nationals, cut the money being sent to Brussels and mean the country could then negotiate its own trade deals.The customs union includes EU states and others, like Turkey, and does not require free movement of people, being directly subject to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) or paying into the EU budget.The downside is British goods and services would face tariffs and sectors like agriculture could lose protections from cheap imports.A soft Brexit is that favoured by those who don’t want the country to leave the EU, or at leastwant to retain some links. The UK would give up its seat on the European Council, but there could still be some sort of free movement of goods and services - and possibly people.THERESA MAY’S PLANUnder Mrs May’s plan, a “common rule book” would be maintained with the EU on industrial, agricultural and food goods. This “ongoing harmonisation” would ensure frictionless trade. Under the arrangement, goods coming into the UK would be charged the UK tariff, as opposed to the EU, and if the goods then were sent to EU states the EU tariff would be applied and the money paid to Brussels.Under this plan, common agricultural and fisheries arrangements would be left, but the UK would stay in the single market for foodstuffs.This could be a complicating factor in striking trade deals with other countries, such as Australia.This would then avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - where goods and people controlling flow freely without checks, but was in danger of ending under a hard Brexit.Her proposal means immigration would come under control with the free movement of labour ending. But - and this has alarmed Brexit supporters - there will be a mobility framework introduced in its place, and she has refused to rule out giving EU citizens preferential rights after Brexit.andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Speaker John Bercow said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which repeals the 1972 European Communities Act through which Britain became a member of the bloc, had been given the formal royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II.The bill transfers decades of European law onto British statute books, and also enshrines Brexit day in British law as March 29, 2019 at 11:00pm GMT.Prime Minister Theresa May said the approval was a “historic moment for our country, and a significant step towards delivering on the will of the British people”, who had voted in a June 2016 referendum to exit the EU.The bill has undergone more than 250 hours of acrimonious debate in the Houses of Parliament since it was introduced in July 2017.Eurosceptics celebrated the passing of the bill through parliament last week as proof that, despite continuing uncertainty in the negotiations with Brussels, Brexit was happening.“Lest anyone is in any doubt, the chances of Britain not leaving the EU are now zero,” International Trade Minister Liam Fox said.Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch Brexit supporter, said: “The legal position is now so much stronger for a clean Brexit.“Crucially this makes the prime minister’s negotiating hand much stronger.” Another Eurosceptic, Conservative MP Dominic Raab, said May would go to an EU summit later this week “with the wind in her sails”.The government had a tough time getting the bill through parliament and was forced to concede some power to politicians over the final Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.The Brexit ministry said in a statement the new law would ensure “a smooth and orderly exit” by giving the government temporary powers to make changes to legislation.The ministry said additional laws “will deliver the more significant policy changes needed as a result of our exit”.Further battles are expected in the House of Commons in the coming weeks, when MPs debate two bills on trade — with pro-Europeans seeking to force the government to keep close ties with the bloc.May has yet to set out her plans for customs arrangements after Brexit, which have become a major stumbling block in talks with Brussels.She will gather her top ministers after the EU summit, which starts on Thursday, to thrash out their differences with the aim of publishing a Brexit blueprint shortly after.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Guns on stands, pointed at the road, ready for action.“My dad always used to say keep your head down, don’t look at anybody, just keep walking,” Fiona told news.com.au.“I look back and think that is actually insane, that is not normal, but that was normal.”Fiona, 30, now lives in Sydney. The border she speaks of is all but invisible. The military barracks and guard towers are gone, as are the armed patrols, but the scars among the locals still remain.The sectarian bloodletting of the Irish Troubles claimed more than 3600 lives over three decades. It only stopped in 1998 with the Good Friday peace pact, which ended the deadly campaigns of Sinn Fein’s IRA allies and the pro-British loyalist troops.But now, 20 years on, that hard-won peace is in peril as the fallout from Brexit raises the threat of those border posts returning, disrupting free movement over the 500km border, with Ireland once more becoming a divided state beset by violence.The countdown is on. The UK is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. The Republic of Ireland, home to 1.8 million people, will remain in the EU. That’s only eight months away.For the past 20 years people on the north and south of the Irish border have been able to move freely.But there's a huge question mark whether that can continue post Brexit.In eight months time, will a border be imposed? Will friends and family from either side of the border suddenly need a passport to visit?And perhaps the biggest question: If a border is imposed, will the bloody battle to reunite Ireland begin again?These questions are hanging over the head of British Prime Minister Theresa May.She has said that the legacy of Brexit will not be a hard border with the EU.But it is difficult to see how she can achieve this, as one of the biggest reasons British people chose to leave Europe was to take control of their borders, and not allow in people freely.If the UK is to honour that wish, they need to create a land border with the republic of Ireland.MORE: Northern Ireland's border is the key sticking point in Brexit negotiationsMORE: Brexit crisis as ministers abandon Theresa May Mrs May is stuck. She will now allow an exemption for Northern Ireland from Brexit. They have to leave Europe’s shared customs union and single market.There’s been talk of a ‘soft border’, but any talk of a border is worrying locals.They want to know how the UK government intends to protect the 1998 peace agreement and that’s not yet been made clear.“At the end of the day a border is a border, whether it’s soft or hard,” Ms Strain said.“The whole peace process was to get rid of the border and get rid of the grudge between Northern Ireland and the south of Ireland.“It will just whip up all the troubles again. It definitely will. I know it will.”Her concerns are shared by Northern Ireland’s top police officer George Hamilton, who believes a fortified hard border will be seen as “fair game” by terrorist groups who think the peace process is a betrayal of Republican ideals.“The new IRA themselves have come out saying that — they have talked about Brexit being an opportunity for them,” he said.There were five serious attempts by dissident Republicans to kill police last year, including one in Belfast in which two officers were wounded. Hamilton suspects there are more to come.“A hard border from a policing perspective would not be a good outcome because it would create a focus and a target,” he said.Tension has been growing since Britain voted in 2016 to exit the EU. London and Dublin have found themselves at odds, and faultlines are emerging between the largely Protestant Unionists, who want to preserve Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, and the mostly Catholic Republicans, who want Northern Ireland to join the Republic.“I was brought up to get along with the other side because my mum and dad lived in Northern Ireland so we had more chance of a Protestant being our next door neighbour,” Ms Strain said.“I have friends from the south of Ireland who only ever went to Irish school and have only ever associated with Irish people and they don’t have time for the other side.“It is still very raw.”Ms Strain worries about her parents. They still live in the house she grew up in, on the edge of Newry, which is part of the UK, while her cousins — only a few minutes’ drive away — live in the Irish Republic.“Will we need a visa to visit them?” she asked.“The police will be there and you’ll have to show your passport and all you want to do it is go to the shops at the end of your street.“That is how surreal it is but that is what will happen.”Among people living along the border, the threat of Brexit is already affecting local livelihoods.Research has found people are being refused bank loans or won’t apply to universities in the UK. Businesses have relocated to the other side of the border or are holding off on employing more people. Others have put new jobs on hold.Questions are being asked about how emergency services will cope and what will happen to children from Belfast who need surgery in the brand new purpose built facility in Dublin.“Politicians underestimate the political, psychological, emotional, social, cultural and economic significance of the border,” says the report’s author, political sociologist Katy Hayward from the Queen’s University Belfast.She says the peace process is a “fragile thing” that can be easily undermined.Only last month, the border town known as Derry by Catholics and Londonderry by Protestants was gripped by six nights of street violence — the worst riots in Northern Ireland in years.Bricks, bottles and petrol bombs were thrown as police fired baton rounds to break up crowds. Children in poor Catholic neighbourhoods, some as young as eight, were being taught how to make petrol bombs and lob them at cop cars.Ms Strain says the dissidents are “the ones who don’t want to give up”.“If this border goes through, then this group will get bigger and the whole feud will start up again. Everyone thinks it.”There is little doubt that a hard border will be a visible, daily reminder of difference and politicians are playing a dangerous game in a place where frontiers and violence are inextricably linked.“It provides a barrier to goodwill, especially if there are issues of migrants,” says Sydney University academic Luke Mansillo.But he believes any violence will “take time to develop” and there are far more immediate consequences for the border, which currently notches up three million crossings a month.“It will be a trade issue impacting companies that do manufacturing within Ireland and other parts of the EU,” he says.“Eighty per cent of trade going in and out of Northern Ireland would face some sort of control or tariff and we are already talking about an economically depressed area.”Yet a hard border is all but inevitable if Northern Ireland leaves the single market and after months of silence on the issue, locals fear the worst. They know from recent history that poor people who feel marginalised and sidelined are fertile ground for recruiting dissidents.“I definitely, 100 per cent think that if that border goes up that the feud will go straight back up again,” says Ms Strain.“And if that happens then everyone should feel scared.”— Tara Ravens has worked as a journalist for over 15 years, notably Australian Associated Press.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

He promised audiences would hear about the way he saw the “global revolution” occurring and about the dangers of globalisation — which he believed was fuelling the big political upsets.The tour website describes him as the “face” of the Brexit campaign to leave the EU and someone who is frequently “widely consulted” for his views on international political issues and populist revolts against the status quo.“[The] fightback that is going on is a lot more fundamental than [just] short bursts of anger. The whole Western world is changing and reshaping.”If people thought it was over, they were wrong.“It’s just beginning actually. It’s just getting started.”Immigration policy was at the heart of what he was talking about it. “I’m arguing against globalisation I’m not saying to pull the drawbridge up but am arguing for the UK to control who comes over it.”The new Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini alarmed many EU leaders this month when he refused a boatload of migrants entry to Italy — a move Mr Farage praised and likened to Australia’s policy on turning around migrant boats.“I’ve pointed to Australia again and again. But despite your geography [and isolation] global money can undermine your liberty. They did it to us, they will do it to you. Globalist money is the biggest threat to Australia.”Opponents argued the nation state was archaic and “doesn’t belong [in the] modern world”. But it was here he believed Australia was at an advantage.“I think in Australia your sense nationhood is more acute, possibly because you’re somewhat younger and your radar is better than ours. But don’t think [global forces] aren’t any less insidious or dangerous, because they are.”The anti-Establishment Mr Farage urged Australians earlier this year to “take back” their country and “stand up and be counted”.That would happen in an instant if politicians forgot who they were working for.“If people in Canberra start to represent themselves rather than the ordinary people then the revolution will come to Australia.”Mr Farage said Mr Salvini used to work for him and found it amusing that “all my mates” were now coming to prominence.They were shunned and derided back then.“At one stage we were on the outer. In 2013 I was having dinner in Washington with a complete unknown, an eccentric guy called Jeff Sessions, who is now Attorney-General, Stephen Miller, who is a Donald Trump speechwriter, and Laura Ingraham who now hosts a major show on Fox. And there was I in this group and we were all fringe of the fringe.”Mr Farage wouldn’t speak about Mr Trump, other than to confirm he was in close contact with the US President and would meet with him when he came to the United Kingdom.“I think he needs to have people he can properly trust. And I’m one of them.”By the time Mr Farage begins his Down Under tour, which also includes an event in New Zealand, Brexit will be closer to being reality.“I’m a bit schizophrenic about Brexit. Us leaving is everything I campaigned on and it’s going to happen, but what is happening is we are going into negotiations in a lily-livered, weak way. It will mean we won’t reap the benefits for years to come.”But a bad Brexit was still a good Brexit — and if he was driving the negotiations in Theresa May’s place he would take a leaf out of his mate from the White House’s book.“I would do a Donald. It would be massively different and it would be all done and dusted [by now]. I would say to them where I wanted it to go, and be reasonable and willing to compromise, but everyone in business knows to get a good deal the other side needs to know [that] you’re willing to walk out the door.”Details of Nigel Farage’s Australian tour can be found at nigellive.com.au andrew.koubaridis@news.com.auFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the EU of “behaving like the Mafia” in their approach to Brexit negotiations during a plenary session of the EU Parliament on Wednesday, April 5. “You think we’re a hostage,” he told MEPs. “We’re not, we’re free to go.” On being challenged by the Chair about his use of the word ‘mafia’ Farage said, “I do understand national sensitivities, I’ll change it to gangsters, alright?”.

The truth of it is you wouldn’t want to start from here.”He said through European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s policy in 2015 of “saying anyone that wants to come can come”, Europe had “imported an awful lot of people who wish that civilisation harm”.“We’re in a very tough place,” he said. “Where do we go from here? Well number one is a massively increased security bill, a change in many ways to how we live. Look at London, we’ve now built walls on our bridges to protect people walking over them.”But he said it was important to engage with the broader Muslim community. “There are some people who want to sort of go to war with the entire religion of Islam, and I’ve always argued strongly against that,” he said.“I’m all for us defending our way of life, the only warning I give is that if we appear to be embarking on a religious war, that would be a mistake.”Former UK Foreign Secretary and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson sparked controversy last week by saying Muslim women wearing the full face veil looked like “bank robbers” and “letter boxes”.Mr Farage, who defended the comments, said it was encouraging that “a lot of Muslim scholars and commentators have now put their heads up and said, this is not in Koranic law, it’s not doing us any good”.He said Australia had been “slightly insulated by geography” from the global political shift reflected in the election of Mr Trump and the rise of populist governments like Italy’s Five Star-Northern League coalition.“But you’re still very much part of the western world,” he said.“Your political class are tempted by the new global order, just as the Americans, British and the Europeans have been. I think the message really is number one, understand what’s happened.“Understand that Brexit, Trump and (Italian deputy leader Matteo) Salvini are not one-off flashes in the pan, they’re actually part of a big, fundamental societal change that is taking place, and understand that those changes could happen in Australia, too.“The internet has given people terrific empowerment to make change if they feel the established order is not representing them. So I would say to Australia, don’t think this can’t happen to you, because it can.”Mr Farage said it was about whether people felt the political class in the capital cities were representing their “thoughts, hopes and aspirations”.“What the change in the Australian voting pattern is suggesting is that there are people in Australia feeling the same thing too,” he said. “The mainstream can of course stop the rise of smaller parties, if they’re more in tune and more connected with ordinary folks.”The Brexit vote “would not have happened without the immigration issue” and there was a “very similar disconnect” between the political class and the public in Australia on the topic, he said.Successive polls have revealed a growing unease with Australia’s record high immigration intake. A survey last year by the Australian Population Research Institute found 74 per cent of voters said the country does not need more people.A Newspoll earlier this year revealed 56 per cent of voters believe the existing immigration cap of 190,000 a year is too high, and an Essential Media poll found 64 per cent believe the level of immigration over the past 10 years has been too high.In 2016-17, net overseas migration to the country came in at 262,500 people, 27.3 per cent higher than the previous year. Australia’s population surged past the 25 million milestone at 11:01pm on August 7, sparking fresh calls to ease the strain on Sydney and Melbourne.“I find it fascinating that even in a country like yours, which many of us up here hold in high regard because its points-based system and all the rest of it, that even there it’s this disconnect,” he said.“You’ve had your terrorist attacks, you’ve had your problems that have occurred down there. People want to feel safer, they want to feel that the people coming into the country are going to pretty much absorb themselves within the existing culture.”He partly blamed the media for the growing discontent.“People’s faith in the mainstream media is collapsing — take CNN, since their non-stop, 18-month battle to get rid of President Trump, their ratings have fallen off a cliff,” he said.“People are voting with their feet when it comes to newspapers, radio and TV, and I think there is this perception that big business, big media, big politics, they’re all in it together.”Asked whether he had an opinion on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Farage said he didn’t “want to get drawn into individuals within Australian politics”.“All I would say is that I was very disappointed during the referendum that so many Australian political figures seemed to argue that the UK should stay part of the European Union when clearly the freeing of the UK from the EU should be a very good thing for Australian and UK relations,” he said.In the lead-up to the June 23, 2016 referendum, both Mr Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten said they would prefer the UK to stay part of the EU. After the Brexit vote, Mr Turnbull “consoled” outgoing UK leader David Cameron.Former PM Tony Abbott bucked the conservative trend and supported the Remain side, but after the poll appeared to backflip, telling a London audience he was “quietly thrilled that the British people have resolved to claim back their country”.“I found it extraordinary how all the global politicians, Australia included, got behind this, ‘Let’s keep the EU, let’s keep the global order’,” Mr Farage said.“But it’s happened, and whilst Mrs May is not doing the job very well, the prospects for our two nations with Brexit are much better than they’ve been for decades.”It’s generally thought the chances of a free-trade deal between Australia and the UK after March 29, 2019 would be better under a so-called “hard Brexit” as opposed to a “soft Brexit”, in which the UK effectively remains a member of the EU in all but name.“An independent UK is able to choose its own friends,” Mr Farage said.“We’re able to strike our own trade deals, we’re able to form our own relationships. I think for many of us who are big Commonwealth supporters, which I very much am, the last few decades have been very frustrating.“We’ve watched the UK getting ever closer to the European political project to the detriment of our global relationships. I’m optimistic, I think we can do trade deals together, there can be a new kind of renaissance, if you like, of the English-speaking peoples of the world.”Mr Farage would not reveal which politicians he planned to meet on his tour of Australia next month, where he will speak at a series of events billed as an “entertaining evening with Nigel Farage”. He said we wanted to meet fisherman Rex Hunt and cricketer Dennis Lillee.“They’re my great Australian heroes,” he said.“All I can say at this stage is there are some quite senior Australian political figures that I will be meeting on my trip, but I can’t disclose those names right at the moment,” he said.“But clearly there are figures in Australian politics I do look up to from previous times. I thought John Howard was a remarkable man who I’ve had the privilege to meet, but in terms of current day-to-day politics I want to be slightly careful.”Details of Nigel Farage’s Australian tour can be found at nigellive.com.aufrank.chung@news.com.auQueensland senator Fraser Anning has called for a ‘Muslim ban’, with both sides of politics condemning the racist comments.\nTo join the conversation, please Log in.

Prime Minister Theresa May responded to his latest indiscreet remarks by saying only that Johnson had “strong views about Brexit” while the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier called the foreign minister’s contributions “always very stimulating”.Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier responded to accusations from other British Eurosceptics that the EU side was being too tough by warning that he would not be “intimidated by this form of blame game”.Ms May said Brexit was “a complex process,” adding that the contentious issue of the post-Brexit future of the Irish border — dismissed by Johnson as “so small” — was in fact “very important”.“The Foreign Secretary has strong views on Brexit but so do I,” she told Sky News while on a visit to Canada for the G7 summit.In the recording of a private conversation carried by BuzzFeed News, Britain’s freewheeling top diplomat also revealed sensitive details of talks with the United States over North Korea and plans to counter Russian aggression, all the while musing about relations with China.The recording was of a conversation with Conservative activists earlier this week in which Johnson also said the government was reaching a phase in Brexit negotiations “where we are much more combative with Brussels”.“You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown,” he said, ahead of a key EU summit at the end of June.He added, according to further quotes revealed in The Times: “Take the fight to the enemy — absolutely right. We need to — and we will.”Johnson revealed he was “increasingly admiring” of the US president, adding: “Imagine Trump doing Brexit.“He’d go in bloody hard … There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad.“But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.”At a time when Eurosceptics are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with government moves to stay closely aligned with Brussels, Johnson said there was a risk that Britain’s withdrawal “will not be the one we want”.He accused the establishment — in particular the Treasury, led by Finance Minister Philip Hammond — of seeking to ensure that Brexit brings “as little change as possible”.As a result, Britain risked remaining “locked in orbit around the EU, in the customs union, and to a large extent still in the single market”.In a veiled criticism of Ms May’s approach, Johnson said: “Unless you have the guts to go for the independent (trade) policy, you’re never going to get the economic benefits of Brexit.”Ms May’s spokeswoman said the prime minister had full confidence in her foreign secretary but conceded there was “rigorous debate” about Brexit, adding: “The PM believes that her cabinet and her government are working hard to deliver on the will of the people.”A source close to Johnson said he was speaking at a private dinner “so it is sad and very disappointing that it has been covertly recorded and distributed to the media”.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

It appealed to misguided \"British\" values Millions of Brits were attracted to the idea of homogenous England of old. Xenophobia is on the increase and Brexit did a great job of normalizing racism across Britain. \"There's a little Hitler in all of us\", wrote Andrew Sarris in 2002, \"if we are not held back by any moral or social restraints.\" Brexit made the normally pathological act of denouncing ethnicities and religions a normative one. Much of the campaign rested upon the idea of an imagined Britain of the final years of WWII when Churchill was a hero and Ghandi a terrorist. 2. They weren't wrong about the EUThe EU is a very clunky beast which was caused a huge amount of economic problems for countries such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland. It's a system of open markets in which competition is eviscerated in a shared currency. Britain has never taken on the Euro, and therefore managed a position of reasonable strength - but the Brexit mob isn't wrong about the unwieldly and regulated organ. 3. It was a revolt against prescriptive elitismJust like Donald Trump's populist movement across the United States, Brexit was a movement with a place for the everyman to stick it to the banks, the politicians, and the corporations who've been prescribing ideology to the masses. Like our own Flag Referendum, it was an opportunity for the country to collectively say \"get stuffed\" to the Government. 4. Leaving may curb immigration to BritainThere is an argument in England that Poles and Romanians have caused unemployment. For every able British person to do a job, there are 50 immigrants who will do it cheaper.This is an emotional argument which feeds into xenophobia but is a massive cornerstone of Brexit campaigning, especially from Nigel Farage. 5. Scaremongering from the British pressA number of very well-read British dailies have made no secret of their support for Brexit, meaning skewered facts and biased reporting may be diluting the facts about Britain leaving the EU. A recent article from the Daily Mail gave \"20 reasons why you should choose to leave.\" 6. It's made a mockery of David CameronThe British Prime Minister reluctantly agreed to hold referendum for leaving the EU to quell the unrest coming from Euroskeptics within his party. It has spectacularly backfired and heralded the resurgence of Nigel Farage. David Cameron is now grappling with a country in revolt, and Boris Johnson hasn't done him any favours by joining the bandwagon.","header":" Six reasons the Brexit campaign succeeded  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:39:16.635Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

Now, it's the single biggest issue in negotiations, as the two sides have failed to find a way to keep the EU's land frontier with the UK open. As the debate rages on, the chances of a messy divorce increase the risk that some kind of border posts will eventually have to go up. Many in the area are anxious about what lies ahead for business, daily life and even peace on the divided island. For others, Brexit has already changed their lives. Damian McGenity runs the post office in Jonesborough, a small village in Armagh, less than 1.5km from the Irish border. The part-time farmer now finds himself a part-time lobbyist for campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit. His life changed the moment the UK voted to leave the EU. \"I was out calving on the farm and I remember watching the result on the news late that night. I knew it was going to be close-then when it was declared I knew we were in serious trouble.\" Fellow farmers, neighbours and business owners from both sides of the border began to meet. \"We knew it was going to be a disaster for us, so we talked among ourselves about what we could do and that's when the group was set up,\" he said. The 45-year-old father of four has attended hundreds of meetings across Ireland and Europe. He's met Guy Verhofstadt and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier's team. \"Our objective is to educate Europe because we do not want a hard border. There are things we can agree on but the clock is ticking and I am really worried,\" he said. Father Joseph McVeigh , 72, is finding that Brexit is getting in the way of his priestly duties since he became a figurehead for the anti-Brexit movement in the Fermanagh-Cavan border region. The priest-who lives in the UK's most westerly constituency and the furthest from Westminster lawmakers-has been providing tours of the area's invisible border to press and tourists for the past two years. \"I have lived in Fermanagh for most of my life, I have seen bad times and experienced the great change that occurred with the Good Friday Agreement and the breaking down of the border following the so-called Troubles when people began to travel freely.\" \"When the decision to leave the EU was made, I along with many others got a shock. I realised that I had to get out and share my views with all traditions.\" \"Mass is a priority every day but this whole Brexit thing does take you away from other duties,\" says McVeigh, who has been a priest for 50 years. \"I want people outside Ireland to understand how we feel and how we think. I have spent many days and hours showing people from Germany, Italy, France and Switzerland what the border is like - it's usually a river or a bridge - and how absurd it is to have a border here at all.\" Fergal Quinn organises bachelor and bachelorette parties in Sligo in northwest Ireland, about 65km from the border. A year ago, speaking to Bloomberg, he was relaxed about Brexit, as the referendum result wasn't deterring the roughly 60 per cent of his customers who came from Northern Ireland, spending the day painting nudes or jumping off cliffs before heading to the nightclub he runs with his brother. Now, the Quinns are noticing a difference at the five venues they run, as numbers from Northern Ireland drop by about 20 per cent, a move he mostly links to sterling's tumble. Just before the referendum, a pound bought more than 1.30 euros. Now, it's about 1.12 euros. Against that backdrop, Quinn is targeting the Irish Republic market. His biggest worry is the possibility of a hard border, with checkpoints and delays. \"That would be a game changer,\" he said. \"It would really hurt us.\" Ian Marshall, 50, is a Protestant and unionist who \"strongly\" believes Northern Ireland should remain within the United Kingdom. Now, thanks to Brexit, he finds himself catapulted into the upper house of the Irish Parliament in Dublin. Anti-Brexit and a former leader of the Ulster Farmers' Union, the father of three was nominated to become a member of Ireland's Senate by Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who wanted a Northern Irish unionist perspective. \"I was completely taken aback,\" Marshall said. \"I had to make sure I wasn't a pawn in a political game, that there was no ulterior motive.\" \"Everyday, I ask myself how did I get here? But this is so important - the Brexit collateral damage could be horrendous. The politicians who want this will be long gone, but our kids will be living with the consequences for 30 or 40 years.\" Kevin Woods has run the Shalom guest house for over 30 years with his wife Jackie. The 74-year-old lives on Carlingford Lough where the border runs through the vast sea inlet. \"For 30 years of the Troubles, a British gunship sat out there on the lough in front of our house. They will never return, it will never happen. If a customs border ended up here I think in the last few years of my life I'd be tempted to blow it up myself.\" Woods also has another interest: leprechauns. He calls himself the last leprechaun whisperer in Ireland, and runs the Last Leprechauns of Ireland websites, running one-hour tours including a visit to a cavern, where he regales children and adults with stories. They way he tells it, the leprechauns sprint down a tunnel under the Lough on the south and meet with northern spirits. For Woods, Brexit is leading to reunification, and not just among the leprechauns. \"There will be a united Ireland, it will come. I won't make it, but others will.\" - Bloomberg","header":" Brexit is already changing daily life on Ireland's UK border  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:39:31.883Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

Around US$2 trillion was erased from the value of global sharemarkets on Friday. Roughly $2.8 billion was wiped off New Zealand's stock exchange alone. Most KiwiSaver funds hold shares, and riskier, more growth-focused options generally invest more heavily in stocks. Bond and currency markets have also been shaken up by the volatility caused by the result. Sharemarkets, including New Zealand's, are likely to fall again tomorrow and uncertainty stemming from Brexit, including the potential for other European nations to leave the union, could stoke volatility in markets even for years. But stocks could recover later in the week as investors realise Brexit is not the end of the world. Canny traders will take advantage of the upheaval and view it as a buying opportunity. Travel That mid-winter jaunt to the UK suddenly became cheaper after Britain's currency fell through the floor on Friday. The New Zealand dollar was buying 52p yesterday, up from 48.5p on Thursday, the best exchange rate in almost three years. The kiwi made a modest gain against the euro to be trading at around 64c, but fell sharply against the US dollar from US73c Friday morning to US70.8c yesterday. A currency exchange chain reported record numbers of people through their doors, and travel agents saw an increase in queries into holidays to the UK and Europe. But Britain has been left a deeply divided nation by the Brexit referendum and there is potential for social unrest, which could put a dampener on your holiday. Mortgages/house prices Interest rates are expected to stay lower for longer as the global economy and financial markets absorb the impact of the Brexit shock. Mark Lister, of Craigs Investment Partners, said the Reserve Bank could cut the official cash rate below 2 per cent from 2.25 per cent. \"There's a good chance that they cut now in August and cut more aggressively,\" Lister said. Lower rates could pour fire on an already heated property market, an outcome the Reserve Bank will be keen to avoid as it juggles conflicting economic pressures - namely rising house prices, stubbornly low inflation and a strong kiwi dollar. However, Lister said heightened volatility in financial markets may increase banks' funding costs. That could mean mortgage rates don't go lower even if the OCR is cut, he said. Migration There have been suggestions that Britain may ease immigration restrictions facing New Zealanders if it leaves the EU. But Prime Minister John Key poured cold water on those claims in the lead-up to the Brexit vote. \"As part of the driving motivation of the leave camp is about migration, it is hard to see them then, if they do leave, all of a sudden having a very welcoming policy on migration [from New Zealand],\" Key said. \"I don't think [access] would be greatly enhanced.\" The Brexit vote is bad news for New Zealanders who hold British passports and have enjoyed being able to live and work freely in the EU. That looks likely to change. It remains to be seen whether Britain leaving the EU will result in large numbers of Britons deciding to up sticks and migrate to other countries, including New Zealand. Trade Although Britain isn't the crucial export market it once was, it still received $3.1 billion in New Zealand goods and services in the year to September 2015. ExportNZ reckons much work by Kiwi trade negotiators will be required to deal with the post-Brexit landscape. Its executive director, Catherine Beard, said New Zealand's trade arrangements would be affected if new trade deals needed to be struck between the EU and Britain. For example, meat export deals may need to be renegotiated. \"Our goods exports to Europe are already highly tariffed and New Zealand exporters are hopeful of changing this with a NZ-EU free trade agreement as soon as possible. Britain's exit from the EU could slow this process down.\" Brexit could also affect this country's tourism industry as Britain is the fourth biggest source of tourists for the sector. The steep drop in the pound's value will make travelling overseas more expensive for Britons. • In a historic referendum Britain voted to leave the European Union after 43 years. • Prime Minister David Cameron, who supported remaining in the EU, resigned shortly after the result. He will step down by October. • World markets reacted to the shock outcome and roughly US$2 trillion was wiped off global stocks. • Britain's pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985. • Quitting the EU is not an automatic process and negotiations with the remaining 27 countries are expected to take at least two years. • A volatile week of trading is expected when the markets reopen tomorrow. • David Cameron will head to Brussels this week for the European Council summit.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e80f86dba1b08b5a8930a"},"url":"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2\u0026objectid=12080303","content":" On Aug. 19, 2016, Arron Banks, a wealthy British businessman, sat down at the palatial residence of the Russian ambassador to London for a lunch of wild halibut and Belevskaya pastila apple sweets accompanied by Russian white wine. Banks had just scored a huge win. From relative obscurity, he had become the largest political donor in British history by pouring millions into Brexit, the campaign to disentangle the United Kingdom from the European Union that earned a jaw-dropping victory at the polls two months earlier. Now he had something else that bolstered his standing as he sat down with his new Russian friend, Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko: his team's deepening ties to Donald Trump's insurgent presidential bid in the United States. A major Brexit supporter, Steve Bannon, had just been installed as chief executive officer of Trump's campaign. And Banks and his fellow Brexiteers had been invited to attend a fundraiser with Trump in Mississippi. Less than a week after the meeting with the Russian envoy, Banks and firebrand Brexit politician Nigel Farage - by then a cult hero among some anti-establishment Trump supporters - were huddling privately with the Republican nominee in Jackson, Mississippi, where Farage wowed a foot-stomping crowd at a Trump rally. Banks' journey from a lavish meal with a Russian diplomat in London to the raucous heart of Trump country was part of an unusual intercontinental charm offensive by the wealthy British donor and his associates, a hard-partying lot who dubbed themselves the \"Bad Boys of Brexit.\" Their efforts to simultaneously cultivate ties to Russian officials and Trump's campaign have captured the interest of investigators in the United Kingdom and the United States, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Both inquiries center on questions of Russia's involvement in seismic political events that have shaken the world order, with the European Union losing a key member and U.S. voters electing a president critical of Washington's traditional alliances. In the UK, recent revelations about Banks' Russian contacts have triggered scrutiny of whether the Russians sought to bolster the Brexit effort. In the US, congressional Democrats who recently obtained a trove of Banks' communications have begun exploring a different question: Did the Brexit leaders serve as a conduit between the Kremlin and Trump's operation? Banks rejected the notion that he was a go-between, insisting his contacts were routine business and diplomatic exchanges - and that the investigations are a \"witch hunt.\" But he acknowledged that the interactions raised reasonable questions about whether the Brexiteers were \"a back channel to the Russians,\" as he put it. \"The only problem with all of that is that not one shred of evidence has been produced. . . . It doesn't go anywhere,\" Banks said in one of two interviews with The Washington Post in Bristol, England, this week. Asked whether Russians had been probing them or seeking to win influence or intelligence, Banks conceded, \"They may have. But if so, it wasn't a very good probe.\" Throughout the 2016 campaign, the wealthy insurance executive built a first-name rapport with the Russian ambassador as Banks briefed him on the breakaway campaign - exchanging frequent, chummy texts and emails and meeting with him in person four times in about 12 months, according to Banks. At the same time, he and other Brexit backers also intently pursued entree to Trump's world, according to interviews and dozens of emails and text messages Banks provided to The Post. As both relationships deepened, Banks and his associates discussed Trump's bid and the US presidential campaign with Yakovenko, the Brexit backers acknowledge. At least two of the meetings between Banks and the ambassador came shortly before or after meetings with Trump. In recent weeks, British parliamentary investigators have sought information about Banks' relationship to Russia and allegations that he was offered financial inducements, including a potentially lucrative gold-mine deal with a Russian businessman he met through the Russian ambassador. The interactions between the Brexit leaders and the Trump campaign have also drawn the interest of Mueller as part of his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign, which is examining contacts between Trump associates and Russians. Two people - former Trump communications official Michael Caputo and another person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation - told The Postthat Mueller's investigators asked about Farage's relationship to Trump associates in witness interviews this year, including Caputo just last month. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats are examining the role of the Brexit leaders after a whistleblower gave a cache of documents detailing Banks' interactions with the Russian ambassador to members of the House Intelligence Committee earlier this month, according to three lawmakers on the panel. US Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, the ranking member of the committee, said he has questions about whether Banks and his associates \"served as a conduit of information to and from the Russians on behalf of the Trump campaign.\" Another committee member, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said the material \"opens a whole new chapter\" in the ongoing inquiry into Russian efforts to intervene in the 2016 US election. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Bannon, who led Trump's campaign in the final months of the 2016 race, declined to comment. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said he was not aware of any questions from Mueller about the Brexit backers and had seen nothing about the topic in documents he has reviewed. \"I never heard anything about the Russian ambassador [to the UK] nor have I ever talked to the president about this,\" he said. Farage and Banks said they have not been contacted by Mueller's investigators and disputed the idea that they ferried information for the Trump campaign or the Kremlin. \"There seems to be a culture of throwing hysterical accusations around without any evidence whatsoever,\" Farage said in an email response to questions. Banks said he and his fellow Brexit leaders have sought to be transparent about their dealings with Russia. Shortly after Trump's election, he said, they reached out to officials from the US Embassy in London in the wake of a report suggesting they were pro-Russian actors. Banks said he and Farage each met once with American embassy officials to describe their contacts. Their associate Andrew Wigmore said he sat down with US diplomats five or six times and turned over numerous documents. A spokesperson for the US Embassy in London confirmed that leaders of the Brexit movement met with American diplomats, including Thomas William, a top political officer at the State Department, but declined to discuss the subject of the meeting. Banks said he was releasing documents to The Post to show he has nothing to hide, and he said he would be happy to speak to Mueller. \"We had so much fun at a parliamentary select committee,\" he said, referring to his recent appearance before British lawmakers. \"We'd love to be called in.\" The connections between the men who would become the Bad Boys of Brexit and Trump's future inner campaign circle stretch back to 2013, when Farage said he first met Bannon - then at the helm of the far-right website Breitbart. The conservative media executive quickly bonded with the populist politician, who at the time was leading the UK Independence Party, an anti-immigrant, make-Britain-great-again force that helped fuel a backlash against the European Union. Soon, the Brexit leaders also began to forge Russian ties. In the fall of 2015, during UKIP'sannual convention at the Doncaster racecourse several hours north of London, Wigmore, a Farage confidant, met a Russian diplomat named Alexander Udod, who then helped arrange a lunch for the UKIP leaders with the Russian ambassador, Yakovenko. (Udod was one of 23 suspected Russian intelligence officers ejected from Britain this year after the nerve agent attack against Sergei Skripal, a Russian double agent, and his adult daughter, in Salisbury in south England.) Banks and Wigmore said they were interested not only in briefing the Russians on Brexit, but also in seeking possible Russian backers for their various offshore investments, including banana plantations in Belize. In November 2015, the two men had what they describe as a \"6-hour boozy lunch\" at Yakovenko's fashionable residence in London. The two men briefed the ambassador on their Brexit plans, but Yakovenko seemed most interested in hearing stories about Wigmore's father, who had been involved in one of the last UK-Russia spy swaps, Banks said. Over tea at the ambassador's house a few days later,Yakovenko introduced Banks to a Russian businessman, who pitched him on a potentially lucrative merger of six gold mines. Banks passed on the opportunity, he said, months before the Brexit vote was scheduled. \"I'm a businessman. . . . Why wouldn't I?\" Banks said of his willingness to consider the deal, saying it had nothing to do with Brexit or Trump. Reports in The Times of London, The Guardian and its Sunday paper, The Observer, about the proposed gold-mine deal and some of the correspondence between the Brexit backers and the Russians have prompted questions in the UK about whether the proposal might have been a way to route Russian money into the Brexit campaign or compromise its backers. Wigmore, who also served in a diplomatic post with the High Commission of Belize in London, said his main goal at the lunch was not to talk about Brexit, but to help find a buyer for a large Belizean banana plantation whose owner had been designated as a drug kingpin, effectively preventing the farming operation from major international markets. \"In hindsight,\" Wigmore said, \"it looks more ridiculous than it actually sounds.\" The Russian embassy in London did not respond to requests for comment, but it has denied that it had any involvement in Brexit. \"The Russian embassy has not in any way intervened in the domestic UK political process, including the Brexit referendum,\" the embassy told The Observer. \"Meeting stakeholders representing all political spectrum of the host country is a natural element of the work of any embassy.\" After their initial encounters, the Brexiteers were quickly on a first-name basis with the ambassador. \"Dear Alexander,\" Banks wrote in a text message the day after their lunch. \"Firstly many thanks for the hospitality. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Beautiful wine and food.\" He went on to invite the ambassador to his \"Old Down\" manor home in the countryside, a sprawling estate and country park with gorgeous views and llamas. Banks said the visit never took place. \"At the time, the Russians weren't considered the baddies at all,\" Wigmore said. \"In London, everyone was engaging with the Russians.\" Indeed, in the months to come, George Papadopoulos - one of then-candidate Trump's volunteer foreign policy advisers who is now cooperating with Mueller's probe - also sought a meeting with Yakovenko. In March 2016, according to emails and US court records, Papadopoulos unsuccessfully worked to land an introduction to the Russian ambassador through a London-based professor and other Russian contacts. Around that time, Farage's movement suffered a blow in the UK, losing a competition to be the official government-financed campaign urging people to vote to leave the EU. So he and his allies struck out on their own, funded by Banks, an insurance and mining magnate. He ended up putting 9 million British pounds into the campaign, Banks said. The effort was boosted by enthusiastic support from Bannon's Breitbart, which by then had launched a UK edition and was promoting Farage and the long-shot Brexit initiative with vigor. On June 23, 2016, the Brexit forces eked out a victory. Suddenly, Farage was an international celebrity. The following month, Farage - who had stepped down from his UKIP leadership post - and his associates attended the Republican National Convention. There, they were greeted as conquering heroes and began to make inroads into Trump's campaign. One night during the convention, Farage was introduced to Trump's longtime adviser, the infamous political trickster, Roger Stone, at an Italian restaurant in The Flats district of Cleveland, according to both men. Stone, who was accompanied that night by the Internet radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, said Farage's main goal appeared to be to get a meeting with Trump. The next day, Stone said, he tried to help by calling his former business partner, Paul Manafort - then Trump's campaign chairman- and suggested that the Republican nominee get together with Farage. Manafort's response was something along the lines of, \"I'll put a good word in,\" Stone recalled. It was another encounter, however, that would get Farage and his allies the Trump meeting they wanted. On the last night of the convention, Wigmore and Farage wandered into the bar at the Hilton Hotel, where they ran into a rowdy group of staffers for Mississippi Republican Gov. Phil Bryant. \"They were incredibly drunk. And the assistant to the governor said, 'Look, if we invite you to Mississippi, would you come?' \" Wigmore recalled in an interview. \"Of course, we said, 'Yes, of course,' not thinking it would be followed up. But it was.\" In an emailed statement, Bryant said: \"I admired the Brexit movement from afar two years ago. I believe the same principles that drove Brexit contributed to President Trump being elected. Both events restored hope to the forgotten men and women.\" The Brexiteers returned to London upbeat about the prospects of more closely aligning their movement with Trump's. Less than a month later, their ties to his operation were further cemented when Farage's biggest American booster - Bannon - was installed at the helm of Trump's campaign. Two days after the Bannon announcement, Wigmore and Banks lunched with the Russian ambassador and discussed Trump's prospects and their upcoming trip to Mississippi. \"We had no idea that we would meet [Trump], but I'm sure we would have told the Ambassador we were going,\" Wigmore said in an email to The Post. \"I do remember him stating that he did not think [Trump] had a chance of winning and you may remember at the time Trump was 10 points down in the polls and the attacks on him were full on.\" Less than a week later, in Mississippi, Wigmore said Farage met Trump for the first time at a high-dollar fundraiser for the GOP campaign in Jackson. Afterward, Trump invited the Brexiteers to a campaign rally and asked Farage to speak on stage. \"Trump says, 'I'll come on stage, I'll speak for a few minutes, then I'll introduce you. You speak for six minutes, and then I'll carry on. Are you OK with that?' \" Wigmore recalled. Soon, Farage had the hyped-up crowd on its feet. \"If I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me. In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if SHE paid me,\" Farage told an audience that roared its approval. \"Folks, the message is clear, the parallels are there. . . . Remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.\" From then on, Farage and his cohorts became almost de-facto Trump campaign surrogates. They attended presidential debates in St. Louis and Las Vegas and a rally in Michigan. When the campaign was rocked by The Washington Post's report on a videotape in which Trump bragged about groping women, Farage went on Fox News to defend him. \"He's not running to be Pope,\" Farage declared. On Nov. 12, 2016 - four days after Trump was elected president - Farage and his colleagues decided on a whim to pay a visit to Trump Tower in New York. They arrived at the building without an appointment or an invitation, Wigmore said, and Farage called his pal Bannon, who responded: \"Yeah, obviously, come along and see me.\" The whole retinue of Brits ended up in a lengthy meeting with the president-elect, whom Banks described as \"very un-Trump-like\" that day, \"very relaxed, open-neck shirt . . . very reflective.\" \"He wanted to talk to Nigel about what it felt like when he finished the Brexit campaign, and it was a very mellow kind of conversation,\" Banks said. Eventually, Farage - the first foreign visitor hosted by the president-elect - would take a now famous photo with a smiling Trump, Banks and Wigmore in front of the building's gilded elevator. During their visit, the Brexiteers got a glimpse of Trump's chaotic operation, listening with amusement as harried staffers argued over who should be named White House chief of staff, Banks said. At one point, Wigmore said, a secretary standing outside the office blurted out: \"You're British. Do you have a number for Number 10?\" - a reference to the British prime minister's home at 10 Downing Street. In fact, Banks did. But he wanted something in return, and Trump's staff was happy to oblige: a good telephone number for Trump's presidential transition office. A few days later, after Banks had returned to London, he and Wigmore sat down again for tea with Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador - their fourth meeting in a year. The Russians \"were utterly gobsmacked that Trump had won,\" Banks said. Wigmore had been handing out the Trump transition team's telephone number to all sorts of diplomats from various countries, he said. So when the Russian ambassador asked for the number, he said he happily obliged. Wigmore said he was \"not thinking there was anything remotely sinister\" in sharing information he had learned at Trump Tower with the Russian diplomat. \"Why would I?\" - The Washington Post's Booth reported from Bristol, England, and London. Craig Timberg, Alice Crites, Josh Dawsey and Julie Tate in Washington and Karla Adam in Bristol contributed to this report.","header":" How the 'Bad Boys of Brexit' forged ties with Russia and Trump  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:40:06.560Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

But the ballot won't say anything about what should replace EU membership. That will be up to negotiators - representing Britain on one side and the governments of the 27 other EU member nations on the other - who will spend the next two years hammering out the terms of divorce if Britain votes to leave. Pro-Brexit campaigners have said that Britain will continue to swap goods and services with EU nations; those imports and exports now make up about half the country's trade volume. Brexit advocates also say that Britain will be free from stultifying Brussels bureaucracy once it leaves the EU. But how will that actually work? And what are the chances that Britain's post-Brexit reality will match the rhetoric of those advocating for \"out\"? Those arguing for \"in\" say Brexit would be a leap in the dark, with leading economists warning of dire consequences. A post-Brexit Britain would have a number of different models to choose from based on the experiences of other countries that exist outside the EU but still do business with the bloc. Here are four options, with the pros and cons for each. 1 Norway/Iceland/LichtensteinPros: In many ways, this would be the least disruptive option. Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein are members of the European Economic Area, a body that gives countries access to the European common market as long as they agree to play by the EU's rules, with certain exceptions for areas such as agriculture and fisheries. The agreement's rules automatically adapt as the EU changes, so there's no need for constant renegotiation. All three countries have had economic success under the EEA. Cons: If Britain is opting to leave the EU to regain its sovereignty, this is not the way to do it. Countries may be technically outside the EU but in reality are still beholden to Brussels. And they don't get a formal say in EU decision-making. EEA members must accept basic EU principles, including the free movement of workers. That means the primary driver of the Brexit campaign - concerns about immigration - would remain unaddressed. 2 SwitzerlandPros: The Swiss model is similar to the EEA in that the Swiss get EU access in exchange for abiding by EU rules. But the Swiss get more flexibility, with bilateral agreements that allow them to pick and choose which areas of the union's many realms they want to participate in - and which rules they want to follow. In 2014, for instance, Swiss voters opted to impose limits on immigration from within the EU, something that full EU members can't do without violating the body's charter. Cons: Switzerland's a la carte approach is a recipe for constant negotiation. Even though voters had their say on immigration two years ago, for instance, Swiss and EU authorities have still not come to terms on how restrictions on newcomers will translate in practice. The Swiss model is so burdensome for Brussels that EU authorities say they will never allow Britain the option, lest the EU become a pick-and-choose union. Like those in the EEA, the Swiss get no formal input on the making of most EU rules. Their agreements also exclude trade in services - a huge part of the UK economy. 3 CanadaPros: If models within Europe don't suffice, Britain could look across the Atlantic to Canada. The United States' neighbour to the north has negotiated a free-trade deal with the EU that is due to take effect this year and will eliminate nearly all tariffs on goods. Former London Mayor Boris Johnson has championed the Canada model, colourfully exhorting his fellow Brits to \"hold our nerve and not be cowed by the gloomadon poppers\". Johnson says Canada proves that it's possible to trade with Europe while also controlling national borders. Cons: The Canadian deal took five years to negotiate, and a British deal would doubtless be even more complex because of the country's web of interconnectedness with continental Europe. Canada's deal also largely leaves out services; Britain's financial industry would take a big hit if the same were true for a UK-EU deal. The British Treasury has estimated that the Canada model would cost every Brit about US$2500 in lost gross domestic product as the UK economy contracts. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that Johnson's depiction of the Canadian model is \"too good to be true.\" 4 World Trade OrganisationPros: If all else fails, Britain would default to World Trade Organisation rules for trade with EU members. The global body, with 162 members, sets a limit on how high the trade barriers can be between any two nations. The WTO option means there would be no requirement that Britain bow to rules written in Brussels. Leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage has pointed out that WTO tariffs have fallen substantially in recent years. And as he said while squaring off against Cameron, \"No deal is better than the rotten deal we have got at the moment\". Cons: No deal could actually be quite a bit worse than the status quo. The British Treasury has estimated that the country's economy would be 7.5 per cent smaller by 2030 in the event of the WTO option, because of higher tariffs and restricted market access. And even this, the most straightforward of all options, could require marathon negotiations stretching on for years, according to the WTO's chief. Britons could also lose their rights to live, work and study in continental Europe without a deal to allow Europeans to do the same in Britain.","header":" Brexit: Four ways Britain could look different  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:40:29.336Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

Plans have been drawn to use helicopters and army trucks to take supplies to vulnerable people outside the south east who might need medicine, according to The Sunday Times. The startling revelations will provoke fresh claims from Brexiteers that the government is scaremongering over a \"no deal\" Brexit, the Daily Mail reported. Supermarkets have also warned suppliers to start stockpiling fuel, food and medicine A Ministry of Defence source acknowledged that there was \"a blueprint for us supporting the civilian authorities\" but said they had received \"no formal request\" to supply aid. Ministers have repeatedly played down the risk of shortages in the event of a sudden hard Brexit next March. There are fears a no deal Brexit could stop imports of food and other supplies, such as medicine, to Britain. Last week Brexit secretary Dominic Raab insisted there would be adequate food supplies. Asked whether the Government was considering stockpiling food to cope with a \"no deal\" Brexit, Raab said: \"It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing stockpiling. \"What we will make sure - and of course the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate - but we will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there is adequate food supply.\" In an interview with 5 News on Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not deny stockpiling is happening. But she insisted the Government is being \"responsible and sensible\" while still trying to get a good deal with the European Union. May said: \"Far from being worried about preparations that we are making, I would say that people should take reassurance and comfort from the fact that the Government is saying we are in a negotiation, we are working for a good deal - I believe we can get a good deal - but... because we don't know what the outcome is going to be... let's prepare for every eventuality.\" Supermarkets have started asking suppliers to begin planning for a \"no deal\" Brexit. Fears have been mounting the UK is set to crash out of the EU in March, with concerns for supplies of food and medicine. German supermarket Aldi has now emailed suppliers saying it wanted to work with them \"to help understand the potential implications\", according to The Sunday Times A spreadsheet was attached to the email showing a breakdown of ingredients and packaging materials, that are all sourced for the EU. A supplier of coffee to Aldi, Giles Hurley, said he was thinking of storing six to eight weeks stock. He said: \"Most of the major retailers have been asking their suppliers how are planning for the implications of Brexit- and especially how we are planning to ensure we do not out of the goods we bring in from the EU. \"They can easily sit back and say they have no plans or concerns because, as usual in this relationship, it will be the suppliers who make the plans.\" But one chairman of a big grocer said \"we're some way off no deal and tariffs being imposed and queues at Dover\".","header":" Worst case Brexit: Army on standby if Britain crashes out of EU  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:41:02.292Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

While it might appear that the cult show has little to do with the EU referendum, the exit vote will make it harder and more expensive to make shows like GoT. That's because when the UK leaves the EU, it will take Northern Ireland - one of the show's principal filming locations - with it. The average Game of Thrones episode costs $US6 million to make. That's two to three times what a typical network or cable show costs per episode. HBO gets a significant grant from the EU's European Regional Development Fund, which was created to spur economic growth across the European Union, to make the series. When Britain leaves, filmmakers might not be eligible to draw from that fund. This means that some of the cash used to bring big-budget productions to Northern Ireland could disappear. Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States' Brussels office told Foreign Policy filmmakers should be concerned. \"It might be up in the air for US studios who want to film in the UK,\" Mr Chase said. \"There are EU programs to help fund all of this. If the UK is no longer part of the EU, that has the potential to go away.\" HBO has so far declined to comment on possibility of the Brexit impacting production of the show, which is or has been filmed in Spain, Croatia, and Malta, in addition to Northern Ireland. The series has also been shot in Iceland, which is not an EU member state. Northern Ireland Screen, the national film agency for Northern Ireland, also reserved comment.","header":" How Brexit could affect Game of Thrones  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:41:16.747Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

In her letter to European Council president Donald Tusk triggering Article 50, British Prime Minister Theresa May warned that failure to reach a comprehensive settlement would lead to a weakening in collaboration in the fight against crime and terrorism. Critics accused May of trying to make a trade-off between security and commerce. But Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said the two issues were mentioned side by side because they were \"all bound up in our membership of the European Union\". \"It's not a threat, I think that's the misunderstanding,\" he told BBC's Newsnight. \"It's absolutely not a threat.\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the letter was \"utterly scandalous\" and a \"blatant threat\", while Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, said the PM should not be using security as a \"bargaining chip\" in the negotiations. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said: \"It is our clear desire and intention that we should continue to play a role as one of the indispensable guarantors of peace and stability in our continent.\" \"We want to continue to work with our counterparts on defence co-operation, intelligence sharing, counter-terrorism, foreign policy co-ordination - and much else besides - on an intergovernmental level. \"At the same time, the PM is right to spell out her vision of a Britain outside the single market - and outside the EU legal order - but able none the less to continue the trading relationship that is so important for businesses and consumers both sides of the Channel.\" In a \"historic moment from which there can be no turning back\", May set Britain on the path to life outside the EU when she triggered Article 50 yesterday. She immediately ran into resistance from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Parliament over her goal of conducting negotiations on Britain's trade relations with Europe at the same time as talks on arrangements for Brexit. \"The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,\" May told Parliament yesterday, nine months after Britain shocked investors and world leaders by unexpectedly voting to quit the bloc. \"This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.\" May now has one of the toughest jobs of any recent British leader: holding Britain together in the face of renewed Scottish independence demands, while conducting arduous talks with 27 other EU states on finance, trade, security and other complex issues. The outcome of the negotiations will shape the future of Britain's US$2.6 trillion ($3.7t) economy, the world's fifth biggest, and determine whether London can keep its place as one of the top two global financial centres. For the EU, already reeling from successive crises over debt and refugees, the loss of Britain is the biggest blow yet to 60 years of efforts to forge European unity in the wake of two world wars. Its leaders say they do not want to punish Britain. But with nationalist, anti-European Union parties on the rise across Europe, they cannot afford to give London generous terms that might encourage other member states to break away. France President Francois Hollande took the triggering of Article 50 as an opportunity to talk about the future of the bloc with its remaining 27 members. \"If we want to look at our future, it should be, first of all, real unity for the 27, but also with the possibility of going faster for some countries that so decide.\" Germany\"We are losing a strong and important member state,\" Chancellor Angela Merkel said following a telephone call with British Prime Minister Theresa May. Her Vice Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, struck a more upbeat note on Twitter: \"Let's stay friends, dear Brits!\" AustriaFor Chancellor Christian Kern, one of the main issues is Britain's considerable debts with the European Union. \"Considering the reported estimates of up to €60 billion ($92b) that the Britons still owe the EU, this will surely turn into a tough struggle,\" he said. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz showed more sympathy for Britain's decision to leave. \"Brexit has shown that citizens' worries and concerns must be taken seriously.\" As Britain will no longer contribute to the EU budget, the remaining countries should consider slashing costs rather than raising everyone's dues, Kurz added. Denmark\"Now it's farewell to Britain,\" said Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. \"In two years, the European family goes from 28 to 27 members. That is really sad.\" He added that he hoped \"the divorce between the EU and Britain can take place in a decent manner, and that we can keep close ties in future. That is in everyone's interest\". However, he warned: \"Britain's decision to leave the EU and the single market will have consequences. Rights and obligations go hand in hand.\" Sweden Sweden \"regrets the British decision\" to leave the EU, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven says, noting Britain has been \"a close and valuable partner\". Lofven welcomed the \"constructive tone\" in British Prime Minister Theresa May's letter triggering its exit from the bloc, adding that he wants \"structured and result-oriented negotiations so that [the EU], even after the exit, [has] as good and favourable relationship with Britain as possible\". The Czech Republic Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said that Britain's continued access to the single market after Brexit was completely out of the question. \"That is as if your wife says that she wants a divorce but would like to return to the family home at any given point in order to take what she wants,\" he said. Zaoralek warned that Britain would lose wealth and influence. The Netherlands \"For many people and businesses in the Netherlands, this starts a period of uncertainty,\" Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. The Netherlands exported €15b worth of goods to Britain in 2015 and 100,000 Dutch citizens live there. \"They want clarity as soon as possible about their future ... The Government wants this too,\" he said.","header":" Row erupts over May's Brexit security 'threat'  ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:41:39.784Z"},"time":"Thursday, 23 August 2018"}

(Withdrawal) Bill, which repeals the 1972 European Communities Act through which Britain became a member, had received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II.The Bill transfers decades of European law onto British statute books in a bid to avoid any legal disruption.It also enshrines Brexit day in British law as March 29, 2019 at 11 p.m. (4.30 a.m. IST) — midnight Brussels time, defined by the end of the two-year Article 50 withdrawal process.The Bill has undergone more than 250 hours of acrimonious debate in the Houses of Parliament since it was introduced in July 2017.Eurosceptics celebrated the passing of the Bill through Parliament last week as proof that, despite all the continuing uncertainty over the negotiations with Brussels, Britain was leaving the EU. International Trade Minister Liam Fox said it paved the way “irrevocably” for Brexit, adding that the chances of Britain not leaving “are now zero”.Leading eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the ruling Conservative party, said at the weekend: “The legal position is now so much stronger for a clean Brexit.“Crucially this makes the Prime Minister’s negotiating hand much stronger.”Another eurosceptic Conservative MP, Dominic Raab, said Ms. May would go to an EU summit later this week “with the wind in her sails”.The government had a tough time getting the Bill through Parliament and was forced to concede some power to lawmakers over the final Brexit deal agreed with Brussels.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:11:48 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brexit-bill-becomes-law/article24262385.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nBrexit Bill becomes law\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:41:55.292Z"},"time":"\n\nJune 26, 2018 16:39 IST\n\n"}

Asked about it, he said he did not criticise Ms. May and was gushing in his praise of his host. Ms. May, likewise, glossed over the comments. “We agreed today that as the U.K. leaves the EU we will pursue an ambitious U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement,” she said. “The Chequers agreement reached last week provides the platform for Donald and me to pursue an ambitious deal.”Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:12:03 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/looking-to-forge-post-brexit-deal-with-uk/article24413921.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\n‘Looking to forge post-Brexit deal with U.K.’\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:42:09.135Z"},"time":"\n\nJuly 13, 2018 22:16 IST\n\n"}

British Prime Minister Theresa May is set to give another speech on the government’s Brexit strategy next week.Officially the government remains committed to exiting the customs union — the system under which the EU operates as a single trading bloc, with common external tariffs and customs barriers, and must negotiate joint trade deals with non-EU states. In January last year, in a key speech at Lancaster House, Prime Minister May outlined the central tenets of the government’s exit strategy which included leaving the customs union.“ I want Britain to be able to negotiate its own trade agreements,” she said. On Friday, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt echoed these sentiments, ruling out the possibility of Britain remaining in the customs union, which he insisted would not leave Britain free to pursue the trade policy that it wished.Nevertheless, hopes remain high ahead of a key speech due to be given by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Monday in which he is expected to clarify the party’s stance on Brexit by pushing for Britain to remain in the customs union. A change in the Labour stance could have a significant impact – allowing for the possibility of pro-Brexit rebels with the Conservative party allying with the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats on key legislation.On Friday, Labour MP Chuka Umunna, Conservative MP Anna Soubry and others tabled an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently going through Parliament, that would commit Britain to remaining in the customs union. ”I understand many others will add their names today,” said Ms. Soubry.On Thursday, Ms. May and members of her Cabinet gathered for a discussion at the Prime Minister’s country retreat, Chequers, to seek to resolve internal differences over the shape of Brexit. While some such as Mr. Hunt favour a “hard” Brexit and a complete break with the EU, others such as Chancellor Philip Hammond believe a preferable option would be maintain much of the existing relationship.Last month, Mr. Hammond faced anger from some within his party after telling delegates in Davos that the government would pursue just “modest” changes to its relationship with Europe.Speaking on the BBC following the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Hunt said Britain would be pushing to adhere to EU rules and regulations on a “voluntary” basis, pointing to the auto industry, whose supply chain was heavily integrated with Europe. However, the plan — which appears to have been thrashed out at the Cabinet meeting — is likely to face a muted response in Brussels, which has repeatedly stressed that Britain would not be able to “cherry pick’ the deal it struck with Europe.Practical answerBusiness groups have also continued to lobby for customs union membership. A customs union was the “practical, real world answer” that solved some of the toughest questions, including over the future of the Irish border, and challenges faced by business, Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the Confederation of British Industry, said in January.Alongside the debate on the customs union, the question of a second referendum continues to surface, with commentators across the political spectrum arguing that the hugely divergent positions on the precise character of Brexit, necessitated a second vote.“We need to see what Brexit really does mean following the negotiation. Debate it in Parliament. And then, if no agreement can be reached there, put it back to the people so that they can say whether the Brexit proposed is what they want or not,” wrote former Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Independent on Friday.Best for Britain, an anti-Brexit campaign group has continued to build support, raising over £200,000, with billionaire investor George Soros donating £400,000 to the group and pledging further matching funding. It is set to roll out a campaign across the U.K. in coming weeks.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:12:17 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-next-big-question-a-hard-or-soft-brexit/article22838477.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nThe next big question: A hard or soft Brexit?

It began with the momentous call by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to push for a customs union with the European Union, which firmly clarified the party’s standing as a supporter of a “soft Brexit” and one that has a pragmatic answer to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.It was telling that the proposal from a party led by an avowed socialist, committed to returning large sectors of services to state ownership, was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry as offering a “real world” solution, while Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary at the Department of International Trade until last year, compared Brexit to “giving up a three course meal... for the promise of a packet of crisps.”Then came the EU’s draft Withdrawal Agreement which translated into legal terms the progress of negotiations so far. It highlighted how far apart positions remained 20 months on from the referendum. Among its suggestions was that should no other agreement be reached, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union, creating, in effect, a border within the U.K. between the mainland and Northern Ireland. This proposal was welcomed by the Republic of Ireland and rejected outright by the Theresa May government.The government was also forced into a damage limitation exercise, as details emerged of a leaked letter from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in which he suggested that even a “hard border” in Ireland would have limited impact on trade.And if that wasn’t enough, in an extraordinary intervention, former Prime Minister John Major lambasted the current direction of government policy. He urged that a free vote be given to parliamentarians on the final deal along with the possibility of allowing for a second referendum, giving voice to the sizeable backing within the Conservative Party for a softer stance. He said in the highly acclaimed speech: “Of course, the ‘will of the people’ can’t be ignored but Parliament has a duty also to consider the well being of the people... The emerging evidence suggests Brexit will hurt most those who have the least. Neither Parliament nor government wish to see that.” This was a reference to the oft-trotted out retort in the right-wing tabloids (and among some politicians) against those who sought to suggest that Brexit entail anything other than a clear break with the European single market and customs union.Then there was a bombshell from the U.S., which plans to slap a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminium exported there, and belatedly on cars from the EU. This appeared to make the U.S. President’s suggestion that the U.K. and the U.S. could strike a “great” trade deal after Brexit rather questionable. The British government has signalled such deals — from the U.S. to India and Australia — would be key to its future success as a “great trading nation”.With all these developments it was little wonder that Ms. May appeared nervous ahead of her key Brexit speech on March 2. With EU leaders and industry awaiting details on Britain’s stance, which has largely focussed on vision rather than substance so far, it would have been a particularly challenging time for a politician who was opposed to Brexit before the referendum. Following her speech, when asked by a journalist whether she regretted Brexit, Ms. May simply said that it was incumbent on Britain’s politicians to deliver on the results of the referendum.Given the trying circumstances, and the competing positions of senior figures within her own party, Ms. May’s speech was arguably as good as it could have been. Facing accusations that her previous key speeches were more focussed on vision than detail, this one got down to the nitty-gritty and belied the rose-tinted vision of the future served up by some of her cabinet colleagues.Both the EU and the U.K. would have to face some “hard facts”, she said, and life would inevitably “be different”. Access to each other’s markets would be less than it is now. “This is a negotiation and neither of us can have exactly what we want,” she said. Ms. May spelt out the details of what Britain would be willing to agree to. She said Britain may choose to commit some areas of regulations like state aid and competition to remaining in step with the EU’s, and guaranteed that Britain would not “engage in a race to the bottom on workers’ rights or the environment”. U.K. law would not necessarily be identical to EU law but would attempt to “achieve the same outcomes”. Britain and the EU should explore ways in which the U.K. could remain part of EU agencies such as those critical for chemicals, medicines and aerospace, she said. However, the EU would also need to introduce flexibility in its approach, she insisted. It had continually sought a tailored approach in its relationship with other nations, making Britain’s insistence on a specifically tweaked deal, with sector-by-sector considerations, not unreasonable.“If this is cherry-picking, every trade deal is cherry-picking,” she said. The Prime Minister also sought to offer specific solutions on the Irish question, such as an agreement to waive the requirements for entry and exit declarations for goods moving between the U.K. and the EU and a “trusted traders” scheme to reduce delays at the border.The carefully crafted speech with reality checks appeared to offer something to a spectrum of views. While Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a staunch advocate of a hard Brexit, welcomed the “statesman-like” speech, Anna Soubry, a vocal Conservative rebel pushing for a modest move away from Europe, said it was an “honest and conciliatory speech”. Europe’s chief negotiator on Brexit, Michel Barnier, welcomed the “clarity” and recognition of “trade-offs”.Yet, there will be little time for Ms. May’s government to rest on its laurels. Her speech offered a glimpse of the complexity ahead, following 20 months of bombastic, fuzzy vision. There will be fewer opportunities to fall back on trite references (“taking back control” and a “global Britain”) when the reality suggests that these objectives are only partly achievable. Ms. May may have outlined the details of the niche deal she hopes to conclude, but it does little to change the EU’s view on “cherry-picking”. The European Parliament’s lead on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said: “While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake.”Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested that even the details presented left many fundamental questions about the customs union and single market challenge for the island of Ireland unresolved. With just over a year to go before Britain officially leaves the EU, time is not on its side.vidya.ram@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:12:31 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/diary-of-a-tough-week/article22936051.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nDiary of a tough week: British government and the Brexit process\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:42:36.463Z"},"time":"\n\nMarch 06, 2018 00:15 IST\n\n"}

Among the groups campaigning there was People’s Vote, a cross-party group pushing for a public vote on any final Brexit deal reached with the European Union (EU).The choice of candidate Optimism was high among those campaigners about the potential signal that the by-election, triggered by the resignation of Heidi Alexander, the constituency’s popular anti-Brexit MP, could have. Initially the loss of Ms. Alexander had been mourned by many seeking change in the party’s approach to Brexit, but that soon gave way to hope as Janet Daby, a candidate who supports remaining in the European single market as well as the customs union, won the internal party contest by a large majority later that day.In the days running up to the by-election, the internal party contest had come to be seen as a reflection of the tensions within Labour. The choice of candidate was crucial: the party had won the seat by a comfortable majority in the general election last year, so the person chosen will, excepting a major upset, end up as the MP. The party put up three candidates, all ethnic minority women, reflecting different positions in the party. Ms. Daby, a centrist, supports maintaining very close ties with Europe, and has even in the past endorsed a second referendum. Sakina Sheikh, the candidate fielded by the left-wing Labour campaign group Momentum, has stuck firmly to the party’s official line, insisting that remaining in the single market would mean “taking rules but having no power to make them”. A third candidate, supported by unions and said to be close to the Labour leadership, also stuck closely to the party line.“Hugely significant that Janet Daby, sensible and strongly anti-Brexit, won,” said Andrew Adonis, a Labour member of the House of Lords and a vocal anti-Brexit campaigner, following the result.Contradictory pullsWhile the by-election has reignited debate within the party about the direction of its strategy on Brexit, it has also highlighted the contradictory pulls on the party. Since the referendum, Labour has insisted that it had to abide by the decision of voters. “Labour respects the result of the referendum and Britain is leaving the EU,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech earlier this year.While 61% of those who voted Conservative in the 2015 general election voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, according to an analysis by YouGov, the choice that Labour was faced with was far more complex. About 65% of those who had voted Labour in 2015 voted to remain. However, while boroughs such as Lewisham voted heavily in favour of remaining, a number of northern Labour constituencies voted heavily to leave (despite, in many cases, having Labour MPs who campaigned to remain). From the early days after the referendum, Mr. Corbyn himself faced criticism over his approach, with some suggesting that more vigorous campaigning in favour of remaining from the Labour leadership could have yielded a different referendum result. Mr. Corbyn has shrugged off such suggestions. He said that despite being critical of the EU, he continued to believe that remaining in Europe was in Britain’s best interests. However, the party’s commitment to respecting the vote had led to it on occasion to vote against attempts to thwart Brexit legislation. Just earlier this month, 83 members of the House of Lords defied a party whip to not vote for an amendment requiring the government to negotiate membership of the single market (the Labour Party is officially against remaining in the single market but wants some form of customs union membership).Many have also pushed for clarity on the party’s position on Brexit. Alongside uncertainty on what the party means by customs union membership, Labour has faced criticism over what its commitment involved in holding the government to account for its promise to deliver the same benefits outside the EU as it had inside of it. Would it be willing to oppose Brexit if those criteria were not met? The uncertainty has offered space for the resurgence of some of the older, centrist voices of the party, such as former leader Tony Blair, who in a blog warned that the party risked alienating voters, with its stance that offered the “worst of both worlds” convincing neither Remainers nor Leavers that it was taking up their fight.Adding to the pressure have been the growing questions over the referendum itself and the spending of various Leave campaign groups. Earlier this year Leave.EU, one of the main campaign groups, was fined over £70,000 for breaching spending limits by Britain’s Electoral Commission, while its CEO was referred to the police by electoral authorities. Vote Leave, the official leave campaign, supported by senior members of the cabinet, is also under investigation over its adherence to spending limits. The investigations have heartened a number of campaign groups that have sprung up to fill a political vacuum left by the two main political parties’ stance on Brexit.Many concernsLast week, four northern Labour MPs joined forces to demand the party’s support for a second referendum. “Whatever you think of Brexit, there’s no denying that it’s a big deal, and it is only now that the full implications of any Brexit deal are becoming apparent. People are therefore entitled to have their say on the deal before irrevocable steps are taken,” they wrote in a letter to Mr. Corbyn. A poll of Labour party members earlier this year found that over three-quarters wanted Britain to remain in the single market and the customs union, while leaders of Labour students and Young Labour came together to urge the party leadership to hold a vote on Brexit at a forthcoming conference. How much these concerns will be heeded remains to be seen. vidya.ram@thehindu.co.inSign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:13:02 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/divided-by-the-brexit-debate/article23980903.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nDivided by the Brexit debate\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:43:08.844Z"},"time":"\n\nMay 25, 2018 00:15 IST\n\n"}

MPs in the House of Commons will vote on a raft of amendments produced by the House of Lords, including one at around 3 p.m. GMT (8.30 p.m. IST) that would give parliament an effective veto over Brexit.Just hours before the vote, the pressure on Ms. May cranked up when a pro-E.U. Junior Minister quit the government so he could back the veto proposal. Philip Lee said a choice between “bad and worse” options was not giving MPs a meaningful vote. Other flashpoints in the parliamentary votes include proposals to keep Britain tightly aligned with the E.U.’s economy.Ms. May has said a government defeat would weaken its hand in exit talks with the E.U. “We must think about the message parliament will send to the European Union this week,” Ms. May told Tory MPs late on June 11.\nUK Brexit minister says parliament vote cannot reverse Brexit The frontpages of Leave-backing British newspapers said accepting the amendments would betray the 52% who backed Brexit in the seismic 2016 referendum. The Daily Express featured the British flag as its front page with the headline: “Ignore the will of the people at your peril.“The time has come for our elected representatives to decide — are you or are you not the servants of the people?”The Sun had a frontpage of British icons including Stonehenge, a fish and chip shop, a London bus and a football, saying “Great Britain or Great Betrayal.“Remainer MPs have a simple choice: trust the people of Great Britain... or trigger a shameful betrayal.”Ms. May’s minority government relies on the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party for a slender working majority in the 650-member Commons. “I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the E.U. which is as frictionless as possible,” she said. “But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.”‘No deal’ scenarioThe E.U. (Withdrawal) Bill is the draft law that would set the legal framework for Brexit and Ms. May is worried about the prospect of a rebellion by pro-E.U. Conservative MPs keen to retain the changes.Some europhile Conservatives were reported to be backing away, worried that if Ms. May was fatally damaged by defeat, it could open the way for a hardline Brexiteer to take over the party and thereby the premiership. Attention has focused on June 12 on the so-called “meaningful vote” amendment, which would give parliament the power to decide what to do if it rejects the final Brexit deal.Mr. Lee resigned from the Ministry of Justice to back the amendment, saying parliament should be able to direct the government to change course. “I cannot support the government’s decision to oppose this amendment because doing so breaches such fundamental principles of human rights and parliamentary sovereignty,” he said. “A vote between bad and worse is not a meaningful vote.”Former Attorney-general Dominic Grieve, a leading pro-E.U. rebel, has put down a compromise amendment on the meaningful vote, calling for a binding motion to be passed by the Commons setting out how to proceed in the event of a “no deal” Brexit.“A meaningful vote is not the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum,” Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC radio. “The end of March 2019, we leave the E.U. Full stop.”On June 13, one amendment on joining the European Economic Area — the single market — will likely fall because the main opposition Labour Party is against it. “Labour will only vote for a final Brexit deal if it delivers a strong relationship with the single market based on full tariff-free access and ensures no loss of rights and standards,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Facebook.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 3:13:17 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brexit-law-faces-crucial-commons-vote/article24144524.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nBrexit law faces crucial Commons vote\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:43:22.897Z"},"time":"\n\nJune 12, 2018 17:07 IST\n\n"}

It is in the process of leaving the European Union (EU) – the impending withdrawal being referred to as Brexit (Britain + Exit). Brexit had its beginning in a referendum in June 2016 when the majority of the U.K. voted in support of a departure from the EU. Brexit is a long process involving several rounds of discussions among the British cabinet members and negotiations with the EU before an official exit could take place on the scheduled date of March 29, 2019. But now, the British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a crisis. The top ministers in her cabinet who were spearheading the negotiations have resigned over disagreement with her on how to conduct the nation's exit from the EU.What is Brexit? Why is it important for the people of the U.K.? Let’s find out in this week’s Five Ws \u0026 One H.Britain has been a member of the EU since 1973. But on June 23, 2016, the U.K. made a historic decision to withdraw its membership. A referendum was held to know the U.K. citizens’ preferences. Of the total 33 million votes, 52% chose to leave the group, while 48% wanted to stay on. The U.K. comprises England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The majority of the voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland, however, chose to remain.The European Union (EU) is a group of 28 countries in the continent of Europe. After World War II, some European countries came together to form a group to foster economic, social and political co-operation. They saw this as a means to stay united and not go to war with each other. With France and Germany taking the initiative, four other nations namely Belgium, Italy, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, signed up to form the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957.People in support of the exit view the EU to be exercising too much control over Britain, thereby halting its growth. One of the main areas of contention is immigration. The people of the U.K. are against the EU’s key principle of ‘Free Movement’ within member states. The U.K. Independence Party was the primary driver behind the ‘Brexit’ campaign.Those who campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU argued that the immigrants would only boost economic growth. They were of the view that the EU membership would ensure security for the nation in times of crisis.But on July 8, the Brexit process plunged into turmoil when David Davis resigned over disagreements with Theresa May. Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis was given the responsibility for Brexit talks. Following Davis’ resignation, his deputy, Steve Baker, and another Brexit minister, Suella Braverman, resigned, threatening to destabilise May’s government. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson too quit a day later.These are terms used during debates. ‘Hard’ Brexit would mean making no compromise with the EU – there will be no free movement of people within the EU member countries, Britain will leave the EU single market once and for all, and the EU will be treated as any other country when it comes to trade (based on the World Trade Organisation rules).On the other hand, a ‘soft’ Brexit would mean keeping close ties with the EU, a degree of free movement and enjoying some form of membership of the EU’s single market.A final summit is to take place on October 18, 2018, when both the U.K. and the EU hope to reach an agreement on future relations. Once the deal has been struck, the U.K. will have to leave the EU by March 29, 2019. A transition period will then last until the midnight of December 31, 2020, when the final exit will happen.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.Our existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nBrexit, briefly\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:43:37.178Z"},"time":"\n\nJuly 23, 2018 00:00 IST\n\n"}

Born in Guyana, with part Indian ancestry, and the daughter of that country’s former attorney general, Ms. Miller pursued a number of campaigns before the one on Brexit, including one to increase greater transparency in the British financial services industry. The backlash she faced from sections of the right in Britain after the court accepted her arguments on the need for parliamentary approval have not prevented her from continuing to be a vocal progressive voice on Brexit-related issues, sexual harassment, and the £1 billion deal struck between the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservatives. In this interview in London, she speaks about the principles that drive her work, Brexit, and why she is a fan of the colour purple. Excerpts:You’ve campaigned on a wide range of issues — transparency in the fund management industry, Brexit, and the implementation of the EU’s new regulatory reforms for financial institutions. What is it that binds these campaigns?I’ve been a campaigner for over 20 years. Starting from small local campaigns and building up to big international ones, it’s always been: you need to shine a light in dark corners because that exposes a lot of the dubious behaviour that goes on. Secondly, I think there has to be accountability and scrutiny or else we get corruption. Thirdly, you have to always ensure that every industry has a societal responsibility.What was it that led you down this route?I grew up in a very political household. My father was an attorney general, and I grew up with a strong sense of justice. Because of that I knew a lot of things that went wrong as well. And I saw the human cost of that, which tended to be women and children. I realised that as a woman I could play\nquite a different role to the men who were fighting for the same principles I believe in.\nWhat do you think you can do that is different?I think I can come at it from a different perspective. We may end up at the same conclusion, but my thought process and how I evaluate things are far more holistic. I am not so headstrong going down one particular path; I explore lots of paths and look at things more collaboratively. I also don’t need to be at the front of things. I can be in the background, connect people, make things happen and create solutions. If you are able to do that — create the right environment for ideas to flourish and pass them on to other people — you can do a lot more.When you joined the Brexit case, were you aware of what you’d be in for?In this case, something that people don’t appreciate is that I didn’t make myself the lead claimant; it was the courts that appointed me. I was never supposed to be in this position. Someone from the right-wing press later told me: ‘Gina, the courts gave us the best person they could have, you were an avatar of hate. A woman, coloured, articulate — it was exactly what we needed. A gift.’How did you deal with it? If you went back in time, would you do it again?In my previous campaigns, I had seen my share of hostility. But when people pick on you — the way you look and sound, the horrendous threats of violence and gang rape, threats to slit your kids’ throats in front of you, they sent reporters to try and find skeletons in my family — I wondered, how do I fight this? And then I realised I had to be me. I had to be completely honest and not let them get to me. Because if you act with grace and intelligence and you believe what you are doing, people can’t touch you. If you don’t give them permission to destroy you, they can’t actually do it.And something different happened around the Supreme Court hearing: more people started writing to me. On the wall I have a letter from a little girl who drew me a ‘Go, Gina’ superhero badge. I realised I could give people hope and it gave me the strength to carry on. Yes, there are always fewer voices — for every hundred horrible things, I get four or five positives — but they are definitely worth it.Knowing everything I do now, I would have done exactly the same thing, but I would have knocked [on the doors of] a few corporates and others to fund me earlier. I thought they’d join in once they’d seen how well we were doing but they were all frightened and they all put their hands in their pockets. The burden of funding has been enormous as has been the cost of security. I would have also explained things to my children sooner. Children are far more resilient than we think. But when it came to taking action, knowing all that I do now... absolutely, I would do it all again.Parliament has given the go-ahead and much got through Parliament. Are you happy with the direction of things now?It’s an absolute indication of where we are politically: we have a bullying culture in both the main political parties, and good MPs with integrity are continually threatened with losing their seats or being deselected. It’s not the structure that is broken; it’s the people in charge and that’s why nothing is going to change. Which is why as much as I fought for parliamentary sovereignty, I think it’s dysfunctional. It needs to be the people who have the voice. And I think at the end of this process there needs to be a people’s vote on all the options [for Brexit] and not just a parliamentary vote because I don’t think they’ll [Parliament] vote for the best interests of the country.Should Britain have a second referendum?\n\nI don’t think so, but [it should have] a people’s vote on all the options: whatever deal we get, no deal and remaining. But we can’t turn the clock back so [the campaign to remain] would have to be ‘remain with a reform agenda’. The question is, how do we get to a better place and how do we mend this country? We are now living in a very divided, hostile country. Even if I had a magic wand tomorrow and we could withdraw Article 50, it’s not going to heal this country. We have to think about the bigger picture: the future of Britain is more than Brexit and there are lots of people fighting for ‘remain’ and ‘leave’ who are stuck in the past and don’t realise what the true agenda is now. It’s about saving this country, it’s not about Brexit.How do you go about that?We have to change the language we use and try and move people beyond ‘remain’ and ‘leave’. There are too many irresponsible people in power who are using Brexit as a power play. It has to come from people with integrity in all walks of life, not just politicians. You could argue that part of the reason for Brexit was that people were irresponsible. We lived in our comfortable bubbles and forgot about others. We didn’t understand what the impact was on different parts of society. We need to step out of our comfort zones and take some responsibility.Can this happen? Are you an optimist?I think what is happening is not defined by nationhood; it’s about people as human beings. The major issues facing us have no national boundaries. The gap between the have and the have-nots is growing ever deeper. All round the world you have companies that have no global home and don’t pay taxes, terrorism knows no boundaries, [there is] lack of water and electricity. We have to fight them together; it’s not about individual countries. If people in positions of power and responsibility can come together to think [about] how they can effect change, we can start changing hearts and minds.What about forums such as Davos?I think Davos is part of the problem. It’s an outdated and opaque place for rich men to hide, rich businesses to make secret deals behind back doors. I would scrap Davos tomorrow.What are your next steps?To me there is the immediate ‘going to war’ almost — the immediate problem and the longer-term conversation to be had once the short term has been dealt with. We will survive [Brexit], we will have the downturn, and no one will take the blame, but after that I think the conversations I’m starting to have already is about thinking about politics in a different way.

I speak at lots of schools and say to the kids: ‘If we could mix the colours of all the [British political] parties, you’d get purple.’ I’m a great advocate of purple politics which puts the country and the people before money and politics.Will Brexit happen?It’s very complicated. I don’t believe politicians or Brexiteers have any grasp of the legal, domestic or international aspects of this, and they will end up being tied up in legislation for years to come. There is also a significant misunderstanding about Brexit: they have an idea that you can stop the relationship and move on, but it’s not moving on. It’s reversing 44 years of integration. They also talk about lowering regulations, but the rest of the world is converging on regulation and they are going down a route the rest of the world isn’t.How do you pick your battles?I tend to pick battles that I can win. I am also always looking at unintended consequences. For every action you can have a ripple effect which is not necessarily the one you want. Things are never black or white and if there is a danger, the unintended consequence could hurt people and be more damaging than the win.

A movement has been growing in the country for over 20 years. In 1997, James Goldsmith, a multi-millionaire, launched the Referendum Party which fielded candidates in every seat, not even one of whom got elected.Another fringe party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), emerged soon after to argue for withdrawal from the EU. The Conservative Party was divided between those who wanted to leave the European Union and those who were supportive. The former were fervent supporters of Margaret Thatcher and the rest were happy she had gone by 1991.When he became leader of the party in 2005, David Cameron vowed to make his party stop obsessing about Europe. To shut up his troublesome party faction, Cameron held a referendum on the question of whether the UK should remain in the EU or leave it. To his surprise, the voters chose to leave by a margin of two million votes or 4 percentage points, with a voter turnout of 74 per cent. Cameron resigned as his policy had failed.His successor Theresa May was chosen by the Conservative Parliamentary Party and famously said “Brexit means Brexit”.The question remained: what did Brexit mean. The European Union is a Customs Union which has no tariffs on trade moving from one country to another within the EU. There are tariffs on goods from outside unless a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been signed (the EU and India have been negotiating on an FTA for years). There is also a single market, which means professional people can work anywhere within the EU no matter where they were trained. Health and safety rules are standardised. So the question has been: how does the UK place itself vis-a-vis EU after Brexit? A hard Brexit would mean severing all ties and becoming a third country as India is to the EU.Then there were degrees of association preserved which got labelled as soft Brexit. Soft can go from some retained association to a much deeper one, which almost meant no Brexit. Political divisions on this issue run through both the ruling party and the Opposition. The process of leaving has a time limit, which ends on March 29, 2019. The UK has to negotiate with the European Commission.Time was running out and no certainty had emerged. Theresa May continued to be ambiguous as people suspected she was a weak Prime Minister. There were Big Beasts within the Cabinet who openly criticised her. So on July 6, she gathered her Cabinet at Chequers, the Prime Minister’s weekend retreat. She presented a soft Brexit proposal and surprisingly, the entire Cabinet agreed. This surprised many MPs because there were said to be hard Brexit champions who had promised a rebellion. The hard Brexit camp realised they had lost. Many said they would challenge May’s leadership and provoke a leadership election.Two Cabinet ministers and a few junior ministers have resigned since, but by not resigning on the spot at the July 6 Cabinet meeting, they lost face. But at the end of the day, Brexit policy has been formulated by a Prime Minister controlling her Cabinet and marginalising her rivals. But it is also a lesson in how Cabinets can discuss, disagree and decide.No one expected him to be so engaged in improving relations with Pakistan when he was foreign minister. As a Jana Sanghi, he was meant…We only care about lynchings to blame the BJP. Child abuse in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh and wherever next matters only to disrupt parliamentary proceedings.…Imran may get lucky. Most prime ministers have been from either Punjab or Sindh.

May hopes it will jumpstart the acrimonious discussions about the terms of Brexit. May is seeking to squelch public dissent from Conservative Party colleagues by warning ministers she will no longer tolerate public criticism of government policy now that the Cabinet has backed her. “She’s made it very clear that if people can’t stick to her position then they should go, and I think that’s good,” Conservative Party legislator Nicky Morgan said on Saturday.May said after the Cabinet meeting that her ministers Cabinet endorsed plans for a future free-trade deal with the European Union that would keep some close ties to the bloc even as it ends freedom of movement between Britain and the EU. The proposal would allow free movement of goods, but not of services. The agreement hammered out at the prime minister’s country residence resolves — for the moment — a long-running dispute within the Cabinet over whether to sever all ties with the EU or seek a more limited Brexit to help businesses accustomed to trading with continental Europe without customs payments or burdensome paperwork.Since becoming prime minister nearly two years ago, May — whose party does not enjoy a majority in Parliament — has endured outspoken criticism from senior ministers, most notably Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who wants a total rupture with the EU. She has now signaled however, in a letter to Conservative Party legislators, that ministers who dissent in public will be dismissed now that “collective responsibility” has been restored.The plan brings May squarely down on the side those favoring a “soft” Brexit that would make it easier for many businesses to operate without new barriers being erected between Britain and continental Europe.It’s unclear how EU negotiators will react to the plan, which seems to fly in the face of EU warnings that the UK cannot pick and choose which aspects of EU membership it would like to keep, and it is already angering hard-line Brexiteers who advocate a total break with the EU.","header":"Theresa May: European Union citizens might get preferred treatment post-Brexit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:44:43.554Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

Think tank The UK in a Changing Europe said Britons were unlikely to change their minds about leaving the EU, despite the political and economic uncertainty it has brought, because attitudes are becoming more entrenched.“The (Brexit) referendum highlighted fundamental divisions in British society and superimposed a leave-remain distinction over them. This has the potential to profoundly disrupt our politics in the years to come,” said Anand Menon, the think tank’s director.Britain is negotiating a deal with the EU which will shape future trade relations, breaking with the bloc after four decades, but the process is complicated by the divisions within parties, society and the government itself.Menon said the research, based on a series of polls over the 18-month period since Britain voted to leave the European Union, showed 35 percent of people self-identify as “Leavers” and 40 percent as “Remainers”.Research also found that both sides had a tendency to interpret and recall information in a way that confirmed their pre-existing beliefs which also added to the deepening of the impact of the vote.The differences showed fragmentation was more determined by age groups and location than by economic class.Polls have shown increasing support for a second vote on whether or not to leave the European Union once the terms of departure are known, but such a vote would not necessarily provide a different result, a poll by ICM for the Guardian newspaper indicated last week.The report also showed that age was a better pointer to how Britons voted than employment. Around 73 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds voted to stay in the EU, but turnout among that group was lower than among older voters.“British Election Study surveys have suggested that, in order to have overturned the result, a startling 97 percent of under-45s would have had to make it to the ballot box, as opposed to the 65 percent who actually voted,” the report said.The difference between generations became even more pronounced in the 2017 general election, when the largest gap in how different generations voted was measured in Britain.The British Election Study has been conducted by academics at every general election since 1964 and looks at why people vote, and why they vote the way they do.","header":"Britons ever more deeply divided over Brexit, research finds","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:45:03.293Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

Not go into negotiations – sue them.”May pointed out that Trump, who was visiting Britain, had also advised that now she was in a negotiation, she should not walk away. “I want us to be able to sit down to negotiate the best deal for Britain,” May said.Trump said in an interview published on Friday that May had not followed his advice on Brexit – one of a number of comments that were seen as a damning critique of her exit plans and added fuel to the raging debate over May’s plans to leave the EU.The president later used a news conference with May to play down his earlier remarks, saying he understood why she had found the advice “a little bit tough”. Trump also said the United States and Britain could secure a “great” post-Brexit trade deal.Britons voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016 and the issue has dominated the political landscape since.

In an attempt to add detail to Britain’s Brexit negotiation, May said the new trading relationship will need binding reciprocal agreements but that British laws need not be the same as the EU to achieve the same regulatory outcomes.May said that in chemicals, aviation and medicine, Britain would seek to abide by EU regulation and proposed a streamlined customs partnership with the same tariffs at the border for goods sold to the EU. “We are now approaching a crucial moment,” she told ambassadors and business leaders in the Mansion House, the 18th century official home of the Lord Mayor of London in the heart of the capital’s financial district.“We will need an arbitration mechanism that is completely independent, something which again is common to free trade agreements,” May said. She added that financial services should be part of the future relationship and that Britain would need a collaborative and objective framework to oversee financial services trade.Her lectern featured the slogan, “Our Future Partnership”, the title of her speech which rounds off a series of briefings by her ministers on how Britain sees its future outside the EU and its economic architecture after more than 40 years in the bloc. EU leaders are increasingly frustrated by what they say is a lack of detail from London on what it wants, and the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that time is short to reach a deal by October in time for Britain’s 2019 exit.May, weak after losing her parliamentary majority last year, has struggled to satisfy the demands not only of EU officials but also of the warring factions in her Conservative Party and major businesses which are desperate for clarity.FIVE TESTS She said she would be guided by five tests including respecting the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum and reaching a solution that can endure. “We are close to agreement on the terms of the implementation period which was a key element in the December deal,” May said. “Both the UK and EU are clear this implementation period must be time-limited and cannot become a permanent solution.” One of the most difficult Brexit questions is how to avoid a hard border between the United Kingdom’s Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The EU set out a backup plan in a draft withdrawal agreement this week that effectively would see Northern Ireland remaining part of the EU’s customs union. That could mean that Northern Ireland would have different rules from the rest of the United Kingdom, something May said on Wednesday “no UK prime minister could ever agree to”.“We have been clear all along that we don’t want to go back to a hard border in Northern Ireland,” May said. “Just as it would be unacceptable to go back to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it would also be unacceptable to break up the United Kingdom’s own common market by making a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea.”","header":"Britain’s Theresa May sets out vision for frictionless trade after Brexit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:45:30.199Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

Sandwiched between a NATO meeting and a summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Trump’s first visit to Britain as president comes at one of the most important junctures for Europe and the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.From challenging Western assumptions about the EU and free trade to courting the Kremlin and North Korea’s leader, Trump has delivered on his promise of an “unpredictable” U.S. foreign policy.That leaves May, who held hands with Trump at the White House during her visit after his inauguration, in a difficult position as she seeks closer trade ties with the United States to offset the disruption of leaving the EU on March 29, 2019. “The irony is that by leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will be less useful to Washington as an ally but it will also need the United States much more,” said Jeffrey A. Stacey, a former State Department official in Obama’s administration.“So May has been thrown into the arms of the most unpredictable U.S. president in living memory,” Stacey said. Over 50,000 people have signed up for a protest on Trafalgar Square in central London against the Trump visit, which will include a meeting with Queen Elizabeth and possibly even a round of golf at his Turnberry course in Scotland.Even taking account of Trump’s penchant for deal-making, the visit is likely to be heavy on rhetoric about an increasingly lopsided “special relationship” and short on specifics such as the details of a post-Brexit trade deal.For supporters, Trump and Brexit offer the prospect of breaking free from what they see as obsolete institutions and rules that have weakened the United States and its allies relative to competitors such as China. But for many British diplomats, Brexit marks the collapse of a 70-year British strategy of trying to balance European integration with a U.S. alliance based on blood, trade and intelligence sharing.“May’s rushed diplomacy with Trump has been foolish: what has she actually got out of the relationship so far?” said one senior European diplomat in London, who spoke on condition of anonymity.“You Brits are leaving Europe but do you really want to jump into the arms of Donald Trump’s America? And more importantly, do you have a choice?” the diplomat asked.HOLDING HANDS\nTrump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election shocked British diplomats in Washington and relations between May, a vicar’s daughter, and Trump have been strained at times. The enduring image of May’s visit to the White House in January 2017, when she became the first foreign leader to meet the president after he took office, was Trump taking May’s hand to help her down the steps of a White House colonnade.But any good vibrations from that moment soon dissipated when Trump, the same day, announced plans to ban migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries – a decision that drew fierce international criticism and appeared to blindside May.Days later, thousands marched on parliament to protest the decision to offer a Trump full state visit to Britain, and 1.8 million people signed a petition saying the invitation should be canceled because he might embarrass the Queen. Trump has repeatedly thwarted British and other European diplomatic overtures, withdrawing from multilateral agreements on climate change, human rights, and a treasured deal to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting sanctions.Officials around May insist that Britain still has the capability to influence Trump, outlining a handling strategy that involves appealing to his self-interest, “planting the seed” of an idea and allowing him time to consider its merits.But, much will rest on the personal dynamic between May, a staid, career politician who prides herself on careful decision-making, and Trump, the brash, often-bellicose, former reality TV star who declared last month he would know within a minute whether a deal could be struck with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.“We talk about Trump and Macron because it seems interesting with some upsides. We talk about Trump and Angela Merkel because it’s ‘difficult'” said Leslie Vinjamuri, head of the U.S. and Americas programme at the Chatham House think tank.“Theresa May gets a bit lost in all of that. She has neither been strong nor weak, there doesn’t seem to be any special affection.”Asked at last month’s G7 meeting in Canada whether Trump was a “good friend” to Britain, May said: “The United States and the United Kingdom are good friends. President Trump and I work together.”\nBut just hours after the meeting concluded he tore up a joint communique on trade, equality and the environment that May and other G7 leaders had labored late into the night to agree. Therein lies the difficulty for May.“When he’s here, he’ll give, but I think when he walks away he will very quickly forget what the visit was about,” Vinjamuri said.","header":"Donald Trump’s visit puts Brexit Britain’s dependence on show","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:46:06.599Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

I think there will be some concerns in the EU that this is essentially Britain picking and choosing what elements of the single market it wants to be part of.”“The EU has always said that once Britain softens its red lines … that they would also show some generosity and flexibility but I think there will be limitations to that flexibility.” Coveney said nobody should be fooled into thinking both sides were close to a conclusion in the negotiations. Ireland is a key EU player in the Brexit talks as the border between it and Northern Ireland will be Britain’s only land frontier with the EU and its status is proving a thorny issue.While both sides agree they must have a contingency plan to keep the border open, a backstop solution was only agreed in very general terms in December and there is no consensus on how to put it in place by Brexit day in March 2019.“From an Irish point of view there is some quite strong language that is positive, mainly that Britain is absolutely committed to what we call the backstop but more importantly they are determined to ensure that the backstop will never be necessary,” Coveney said.","header":"Ireland says United Kingdom Brexit plan a significant move in talks","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:46:20.406Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

He said her plan would allow EU regulations to harm British manufacturers. “Be in no doubt: under the government’s proposal our fingers would still be caught in this mangle and the EU would use it ruthlessly to punish us for leaving and handicap our future competitiveness,” Davis said.Steve Baker, a senior lawmaker who served as a deputy to Davis in the Brexit ministry before resigning with his boss, said May had presided over a “cloak and dagger” plot to undermine Brexit. May’s position was further undermined by Trump who said in an interview published in Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper on Friday that her proposals would probably kill off any chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the world’s biggest economy.Though Trump later contradicted his comments by then promising a great U.S. trade deal, the president made clear his admiration for the 54-year-old Johnson, who Trump said would one day make a great British prime minister.\nSteve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser, was even quoted by Britain’s Daily Telegraph as saying that it was now time for Johnson to challenge May for her job. “Now is the moment,” The Telegraph quoted Bannon, Trump’s former strategist and a key player in his 2016 election campaign, as saying. “If Boris Johnson looks at this… There comes an inflection point, the Chequers deal was an inflection point, we will have to see what happens,” Bannon said.BREXIT TEST FOR MAYJohnson, the face of the Brexit campaign for many has remained silent in public since he warned in his resignation letter on July 9 that the “Brexit dream” was being suffocated by needless self-doubt. The Telegraph newspaper said Johnson had re-joined the newspaper as a columnist with effect from Monday. The extent of divisions within May’s Conservative Party over Brexit will become clearer over the course of two debates in parliament over coming days.Pro-Brexit lawmakers are expected to use a debate on Monday on customs legislation to try to force her to harden up her Brexit plan, while a debate on trade on Tuesday will see pro-EU lawmakers push for even closer ties with the bloc.Brexiteer rebels are unlikely to have enough support in parliament to win a vote, but the debate will show how many in May’s party are prepared to vote against her at a time when some are look to gather the necessary numbers to challenge her leadership.","header":"British PM Theresa May warns rebels: Back me or risk ‘no Brexit at all’","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:46:41.512Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

The EU and Britain are hoping to seal a deal this month on a transition period after Brexit, and start talks on their future relationship this spring.But mounting differences over Britain’s divorce from the EU have led the bloc to warn repeatedly that time was running out, that the post-Brexit transition was not a given, and that London should be more precise and realistic on what sort of future ties it sought.“One cannot have at the same time the status of a third country and demand at the same time the advantages of the (European) Union,” Barnier told a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. “It is time to face up to the hard facts,” he added.The EU last week snubbed British Prime Minister Theresa May’s calls for a special post-Brexit deal by offering London just a free-trade agreement with no special treatment for Britain’s mighty financial sector. Barnier said on Tuesday there were no other options, given London’s desire to leave both the European Union’s single market and its customs union.He also defended an EU proposal for the bloc to continue to regulate trade in the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, should no other ways emerge to avoid a hard border between that territory and the country of Ireland. That plan prompted furious reactions in London and Belfast. But Barnier said it dealt with the realities on the ground. “It is our responsibility to detail operationally how we will avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland without another solution and bearing in mind the decision of the UK to leave the single market and the customs union,” he said.MARCH SUMMIT LOOMINGSpeaking on the same occasion, the head of the bloc’s executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, also reminded London there was no time to waste before Britain leaves the bloc, as is due in March 2019. “It is obvious that we need further clarity from the UK if we are to reach an understanding on our future relationship,” Juncker said.“As the clock counts down, with one year to go, it is now time to translate speeches into treaties, to turn commitments into agreements.” The 27 remaining EU leaders will endorse a joint stance on their future relationship with Britain in Brussels on March 23. That would be then translated into a mandate for Barnier to negotiate with London.The EU is determined to prevent Britain from picking particular benefits of close integration without sharing the costs and obligations, fearing such an example would tear the bloc apart with more countries trying to follow suit.","header":"EU tells Britain to ‘face up to hard facts’ on Brexit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:46:53.950Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

It isn’t about the UK becoming more in isolation or withdrawing from the rest of world. It is very much like us becoming a global Britain,” he said. “There is obviously uncertainty for companies either investing in the UK or looking to invest because our future trading relationship with the rest of Europe is yet to be determined. That will become clear over the next few months,” he said adding that the UK will retain same trading arrangements until March 2020. On trade and investment, he said, “We have seen 15 per cent growth in trade in both directions and the trade between two countries worth `1.6 lakh crore.”  The UK has issued 5.5 lakh visas to Indian citizens last year. “There is an increase of 11 per cent in the tourist visas and 27 per cent increase in student visas. We welcome Indians who want visit the UK for holidays or visiting family members or on business purpose,” he said.Due to tough regulations, the student visas decreased in the last few years. But in 2016-17 it was increased by 27 per cent to 14,500. “We have streamlined student visas and now getting quality students,” Mr Joshi said. “The UK is issuing around 60 per cent skilled labour visas to the Indian citizens which are more than what we give to the rest of the world combined,” he noted.On extraditing fugitive businessmen like Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi he said, “We are absolutely committed to implementing money laundering rules. Like in India, we have the legal process for extradition. The enforcement authorities work very closely with the governments, but the final decision rests with the courts.” When asked about protests against Sterlite Industries in Thoothukudi, owned by UK’s Vedanta Resources, he said the issue is currently under arbitration.","header":"\nUK’s relationship with India to grow post Brexit\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:47:17.437Z"},"time":" 27 m "}

Davis was a strong pro-Brexit voice in a Cabinet divided between supporters of a clean break with the bloc and those who want to keep close ties with Britain’s biggest trading partner.May’s office said a replacement for Davis would be announced Monday.His departure could embolden Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers, who have long considered May too prone to compromise with the EU, to challenge her leadership.The staunchly pro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker Andrea Jenkyns tweeted: “Fantastic news. Well done David Davis for having the principal and guts to resign.”Jenkyns said Steve Baker, a junior minister in the Brexit department, had also quit. There was no immediate comment from Baker.Less than nine months remain until Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, 2019, and the EU has warned Britain repeatedly that time is running out to seal a divorce deal.On Friday, Davis and the rest of May’s fractious Cabinet finally agreed on a plan for future trade ties with the EU.May is due to brief lawmakers Monday on the plan hammered out during a 12-hour meeting at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat. It seeks to keep the UK and the EU in a free-trade zone for goods, and commits Britain to maintaining the same rules as the bloc for goods and agricultural products.Some Brexit-supporting lawmakers are angry at the proposals, saying they will keep Britain tethered to the bloc and unable to change its rules to strike new trade deals around the world.In his resignation letter, Davis said the “‘common rule book’ policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.”He said he was worried the government’s negotiating approach would “lead to further demands for concessions” from Brussels.“It seems to me that the national interest requires a secretary of state in my department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript,” he wrote.In a letter to Davis, May disagreed with his characterization of her plans, saying the deal she seeks “will undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels to the United Kingdom.”Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leader of the party’s “hard Brexit” faction, compared May’s plan to an egg so softly boiled that it “isn’t boiled at all.”“A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker,” he said.Some Brexiteers dream of replacing May with a staunch Brexiteer, such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who in the past has disagreed publicly with his boss.Johnson has not commented publicly since Friday. But some senior pro-Brexit ministers have backed May’s plan. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said Sunday that it did not contain everything he wanted but “I’m a realist.”“All those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal,” he told the BBC.","header":"\nUK's top Brexit minister quits govt, cites policy differences with PM May\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:48:00.666Z"},"time":" 1 m "}

The tickets are expensive, and the youngsters prefer to spend holidays in Turkey or Morocco,\" says Nafees.\"When I was younger, we would come every year, but this is the first time after four years,\" says Alisha Iqbal, a young Birmingham financial analyst who is enjoying her last day in Mirpur, filling her luggage with colorful outfits and local ingredients.\"I don't have that much holidays, so I tend to choose closer, cheaper destination.\"Even among the second generation who continue to visit the city, few send money back to Pakistan.And apart from the arranged marriages between British and Pakistani Mirpuris, emigrant families are not returning as often to celebrate their weddings in Kashmir.For Nadeem Hussain, a fast food manager in Stoke-on-Trent, the ties that bind the communities will likely fade into oblivion within a generation or two.His family serves as a textbook example of the fraying relations. Twenty years ago, his father built a home in Kashmir and bought land hoping to retire back in Mirpur.But now his father has abandoned those plans.\"Pakistan has changed, it is too complicated to come back,\" he explains while sharing a dessert with his two-year-old daughter. \"I don't think my daughter's children will retain that many links with Mirpur.\"","header":"\nHow Brexit is affecting Pakistan’s ‘Little England’\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:48:22.133Z"},"time":" 1 m "}

The UK cannot overlook the significance of the Indian economy (set to be the third-largest in the world by 2030) and must ensure that, beyond Brexit, it remains a leading investment destination,” he added.This year's Tracker highlights 87 fast-growing Indian companies in the UK, as well as the top Indian employers, and provides insight into the evolving scale, business activities, locations and performance of the Indian-owned companies making the biggest impact in the UK.The top five fastest-growing Indian companies and employers in Britain have been identified as TMT Metal Holdings Ltd, Wipro Holdings UK Ltd, Piramal Imaging Ltd, Tata Group firm TCNA UK Ltd, Route Mobile UK Ltd.\"The phenomenal growth rate just goes to show that Brexit or no Brexit, the UK remains a very important partner for India,\" said Y K Sinha, the Indian high commissioner to the UK.To be included in the Tracker, now in its fifth year, Indian corporates must have a minimum two-year track record in the UK, turnover of more than 5 million pounds and year-on-year revenue growth of at least 10 per cent, based on the latest published accounts filed as at February 28, 2018.The companies that made it to the tracker achieved an average annual growth rate of 44 per cent, with seven companies seeing turnover growth of more than 100 per cent.Companies in technology and telecoms and pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors have again featured strongly and this year make up 20 per cent and 16 per cent of the list respectively.For the first time this year, companies from the engineering and manufacturing sector came joint second in the number of companies in the tracker. This year's report also identifies operating profits of 2.25 billion pounds for Indian companies operating in the UK.This year for the first time the tracker also identified that 19 per cent of these fast growing Indian companies in the UK had women on their boards.\"At a time when the UK is forging a future outside of the European Union, it will be looking to strengthen its ties with long-standing partners like India. The Indian economy is forecast to grow substantially and what the UK must focus on is both creating new and maintaining existing investment opportunities as it competes for India's investment on a global platform,” said Shuchita Sonalika, Director and Head of CII UK.Of the 87 companies that made the cut for 2018, 22 had featured in last year's list as well and one-third of the total number of firms recorded an impressive growth rate of over 50 per cent.ondon strengthened its dominance as the leading destination for Indian investment, with over half of the fast-growing firms now based in the British capital, up from 44 per cent in 2017 and 39 per cent in 2016.Seven companies in the ranking achieved turnover growth of more than 100 per cent, including TMT Metal Holdings Ltd, Route Mobile (UK) Ltd and Accord Healthcare Ltd, and four companies appear in the Tracker for the fifth consecutive year – Accord Healthcare Ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Europe Ltd, Milpharm Ltd, and Secure Meters (UK) Ltd.Wipro, Union Bank of India, Accord Healthcare and Secure Meters were also recognised with Grant Thornton 2018 awards for an impressive fast growth trajectory in their respective sectors.","header":"\nIndian companies integral to post-Brexit growth in UK: reports\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:48:51.340Z"},"time":" 11 m "}

The following is a summary of a joint report showing the agreements on three key topics.Citizen’s Rights Refers to British citizens, including spouses and children, living in an EU state and other EU nationals living in Britain on date of its withdrawal.It does specify whether British citizens may move from one EU state to another and retain the same rights. Citizens with permanent residence documents should get new ones free of charge and can be absent for up to five years without losing their rights.Equal treatment will cover rights with respect to social security, health care, employment and education. The European Court of Justice (CJEU) is the ultimate arbiter of EU law.The agreement states that “UK courts shall therefore have due regard to relevant decisions of the CJEU.” EU and Britain have agree to set up a mechanism enabling UK courts to ask the CJEU to weigh in when necessary during an eight year period following Brexit.Ireland and Northern IrelandBritain promises to preserve the integrity of its own internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it. It says it does not want a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, saying it aims to avoid checks and controls there via a future EU-UK economic relationship.If this is not possible, Britain says it will propose “specific solutions to address the unique circumstances.”In the absence of such solutions, Britain will “maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 (Good Friday peace) Agreement.”It pledges to ensure there are “no new regulatory barriers” and “unfettered access” for Northern Ireland’s businesses to the rest of Britain.

This guarantee will decrease over time. “The UK share of the paid-in capital will be reimbursed in 12 annual instalments starting at the end of 2019.The first eleven instalments will be 300 million euros each and the final one will be 195,903,950 euros.” On the European Central Bank, “the paid-in capital of the UK in the ECB will be reimbursed to the Bank of England (BoE) after the date of withdrawal.”","header":"\nCitizen’s rights, border, financial settlement: What’s in the Brexit deal?\n","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:49:49.909Z"},"time":" 14 s "}

There is not going to be a second referendum ... under any circumstances,” the spokesman told reporters.The spokesman's comments came after a former senior British minister called on Monday for another referendum to solve a parliamentary stalemate on Brexit, saying May's proposals for new ties with the European Union were a fudge that satisfied no one.Justine Greening, a former education secretary who quit the government in January, said May's negotiating strategy would neither please those who wanted a clean break with the EU nor those who opposed Brexit altogether.\"We'll be dragging Remain voters out of the EU for a deal that means still complying with many EU rules, but now with no say on shaping them,\" Greening wrote in the Times newspaper.\"It's not what they want, and on top of that when they hear that Leave voters are unhappy, they ask, 'What's the point?'.

Two senior ministers resigned in protest shortly afterwards.May is now facing a possible rebellion from Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party who want her to ditch her plan when lawmakers vote on amendments to legislation on the government's post-Brexit customs regime on Monday.However, she has told unhappy lawmakers that they needed to back her or risk there being no Brexit at all.Greening said that with divisions in the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party over how to proceed with Brexit, there should be another vote, with the public able to choose between May's plans, a \"no-deal\" break with the EU or remaining in the bloc.\"The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people,\" she said.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e839a6dba1b08b5a8a17d"},"url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/businesses-need-to-prepare-for-hard-brexit","content":"When European Union heads meet at the end of this month, they are likely to issue a warning to bureaucracies and firms to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, also known as a \"hard\" or \"cliff-edge\" Brexit, because that is where things appear to be heading in the talks between the EU and Britain.At this point, it is calming to view such signals in a game theory context. British Prime Minister Theresa May has an incentive to take things to the edge - possibly beyond October, the current deadline for a deal - so she can get her version of any exit agreement through Parliament; she is more interested in a last-second, cliffhanger vote than in a protracted debate.The EU, frustrated by a British side that has nothing to offer, has been talking about the likelihood of a hard Brexit for more than a year, but that could be just a demonstration of willingness to walk away from the table.If there is no deal, Britain will drop out of the EU in March next year without a transition period. That will create gaps in regulations and the capacity to enforce them, mainly in Britain.The Financial Times recently reported that the British government isn't doing much about that because it doesn't consider \"no deal\" a realistic scenario. But believing that the sides are bluffing can result in nasty surprises because the negotiations aren't exactly poker. It's a game in which the interests of some of those at the table - at least when it comes to many Conservative Brexiters - are not aligned with those they represent.It is businesses that really need to prepare for trading across the Channel according to World Trade Organisation rules, which mean 2 per cent tariffs on most goods but 10 per cent on cars and 20 per cent on agricultural products. Customs barriers will also spring up, increase costs and slow down deliveries.Last year, Dr Wen Chen of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and his international team of collaborators analysed which regions in EU countries were most exposed to Brexit. Because of the deep level of the data, this is probably the best analysis of the exposure to date.His calculations, however, assume that Brexit will set British-EU trade to zero (there's no other way to get at the full share of gross domestic product that could potentially be affected). In real life, though, a 2 per cent tariff, slightly longer delivery times and the added cost of Customs clearance - estimated, for example, at €500 million (S$785.8 million) a year for Germany, the EU's biggest economy - will not affect trade volumes much. The economic actors who really do need to prepare for a cliff-edge Brexit are primarily in the auto industry, agriculture and finance, where British and European firms would be cut off from operating in each other's markets directly by the end of passporting.In the financial services industry, a no-deal Brexit is considered a serious threat. In March, the global Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), whose members work in the entire range of financial companies and banks, published the results of a Brexit-themed survey. Three-quarters of its participants work outside Britain; 77 per cent of those asked said a hard Brexit would be damaging to their business; and 6 per cent said their firms would no longer have a viable business model.At the same time, preparations have been going too slowly: 23 per cent of the ACCA members (and 31 per cent of those working in small firms) said their companies had not even begun planning for Brexit. Only 8 per cent said they had begun to implement their plans, a measly 3 percentage point increase from March 2016.That would appear to make the financial services industry a particularly important audience for the upcoming EU warning. A just-released Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on the EU downplays the risk - but still notes the potential that a lack of preparedness can cause adverse consequences.\"EU entities will probably retain sufficient access to wholesale and retail financial services post-Brexit, as most financial services are currently already provided in the EU-27 and relevant UK entities can relocate part of their activities to other EU member states,\" said the OECD. \"On the other hand, moving from wholesale banking centred in London to a potentially more fragmented banking landscape might increase the cost of capital for households and non-financial corporations, as the economies of scale and scope of the London industry may diminish.\"It's somewhat harder for industrial and agricultural firms to Brexit-proof their operations. Finding other markets for products can be a tough task. According to Deloitte, a hard Brexit would cut German car exports to Britain by 255,000 a year, worth about €6.7 billion or 5 per cent of sales. About 18,000 jobs would be endangered. European automakers in total would lose about €8.7 billion in sales. Car-part sales would not be hurt as badly because the tariff on them would be 4.5 per cent, not 10 per cent as for cars, but thousands of jobs could still evaporate as imports from the rest of the world become more economically viable for Britain.A survey of German enterprises by the national association of industry and commerce chambers, published earlier this year, showed that only 14 per cent of firms considered themselves well prepared for Brexit's consequences. In particular, the German car industry, the biggest potential loser, is heavily invested in pushing the government and the EU to make a deal. It has assumed too much, and it should focus more on no-deal preparations.The Irish government and Ireland's agricultural producers, who stand to lose 39 per cent of their exports - worth €4.8 billion a year - if Britain leaves without a deal, also hope for a favourable outcome, but at least they are working visibly to get ready for a cliff-edge Brexit. The Irish Agriculture Ministry has sent special missions to Japan, South Korea, the United States, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with a view to shifting some of the exports to those places. And some firms are already changing their product mix to suit new markets, retooling, for example, to produce Norwegian Jarlsberg cheese for the US and Australia rather than cheddar for Britain.Not believing in the possibility of a no-deal outcome could cost businesses billions of dollars in lost revenue. Regardless of whether Britain and the EU are only playing a game, it is a dangerous one. The quality of the players on the British side and the EU's multitude of other concerns make the worst outcome entirely possible. So all the warnings the parties issue as they try not to blink should be taken extremely seriously.

The government's proposal was passed without a vote.Mrs May adopted a high-risk strategy by directly facing off with rebels in her Conservative Party, and it seemed to pay off. One lawmaker said Mrs May had had no option but to take on the rebels or risk their rebellion growing.But the battle may be a taste of things to come. Mrs May needs to get several Bills through Parliament to prepare Britain for life outside the European Union.Some of her opponents on Brexit may simply have decided to keep their powder dry for later fights on issues such as future trading ties with the bloc.Mr Grieve had led the potential rebellion over Mrs May's proposal - to offer Parliament a statement setting out what she will do if she fails to negotiate an agreement with the EU, or if lawmakers reject any deal she returns with.But after days of lobbying by Conservative officials that Parliament should not tie the government's hands in the Brexit talks and that lawmakers were handing an advantage to the EU, Mr Grieve seemed to have put his concerns aside.Mr Grieve said he now saw he needed to take account of Mrs May's concerns over the state of the negotiations, which have all but stalled because of divisions in her government.While Mrs May won the day, the high-stakes vote is a reminder of how difficult her situation is.Her Conservative Party commands only a slim majority in the 650-seat Commons and relies on the support of Northern Ireland's 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs.In a sign of how close yesterday's vote was, heavily pregnant and sick MPs were called in to cast their ballots, including one in a wheelchair.REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSEWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

This is basically just an insurance policy for now.\"President Jean-Claude Juncker gave British staff a formal undertaking in late March that the Commission would not exercise its right to dismiss them after March 29, 2019, when they lose the EU citizenship that is a normal requirement for employment.But despite such sympathy at the top for their plight, Britons have already been voting with their feet.Public data shows that on January 1 this year there were 894 Commission employees whose officially recorded first nationality was British. That was down 135, or 13 per cent, from a year earlier and 240, or 21 per cent, fewer than at the start of 2016.Internal data cited by an EU official showed that since May 2016 \"slightly above 150\" Britons retired, resigned or left at the end of the kind of temporary contract given to a quarter of the Commission's 32,000 staff; some 65 British citizens were hired, but all but four of these were on short-term contracts.NEW PASSPORTSStrikingly, compared to that net decline of 85, \"slightly above 100\" more Britons also switched their \"first nationality\"to another of the 27 EU states, notably to Ireland, where many millions of British people have roots, as well as to France.In a tweet sent on the day after the Brexit vote devastated his colleagues, one British EU official with dual nationality posted a photo of a bottle of Irish whiskey.He wrote: \"Time to connect with my Irishness to numb my wounded Britishness.\"Britain allows dual nationality, so those switching in the EU are not obliged to renounce their private UK citizenship.Conversations with EU officials - none would speak on the record about personal choices - shows some Britons already had dual citizenship and have merely switched to the \"first nationality\" recorded in Commission records.Some raced to acquire new passports after the referendum. Others also have another citizenship but have yet to formally switch to it, while many are thinking of or are applying to other countries.Among these, notably, is Belgium. It has resisted granting citizenship to some EU officials, despite many having spent decades living in Brussels, on the grounds they have not been in the local tax system.Juncker appealed personally to the Belgian prime minister this month to show them compassion.The issue of nationality in EU careers is a delicate one. Formally, officials \"leave their passports at the door\", though officials also expect teams to reflect the bloc's diversity.A Commission spokeswoman told Reuters: \"We can't see how changing first nationality ... could result in any sort of advantage. Promotions of EU officials are based on merit only.\"Even before Brexit, that view is contested by some who say privately that British colleagues have been passed over for expected promotions or removed from work that superiors feared could cause a conflict of loyalties between Brussels and London.Some British EU staff say that has offended them, arguing that, if anything, they feel the Brexit vote has strengthened their commitment to a project people back home have abandoned.\"It's been painful,\" said one veteran staffer. \"Since the referendum, I feel much less British - but the world sees me as much less European,\"STIFF UPPER LIPEven those switching passports see little hope - certainly not in senior positions, where national governments are unlikely to lobby for what one Irish official described as \"re-badged Brits\". Like other capitals, Dublin wants jobs for its own.The number of Commission officials recording Irish first nationality rose by 37 to 520 in the two years to January.An Irish EU embassy spokesman said the issue of British EU officials taking Irish nationality was \"complex\" and that the government was \"continuing to monitor matters\".Even without Brexit, Euro-Brits have been a vanishing breed, reflecting what many of them see as long growing indifference to the EU among British voters and successive London governments.While they once made up closer to the 13 per cent of the current EU population that Britain accounts for, they are today just 3 per cent of Commission, albeit better represented in the senior ranks, reflecting longer EU membership than most states and more effort to see \"national balance\" across the top jobs.Some British staffers speak of serving out time till their pension; others are sticking to EU ambitions, knowing that the Commission does hire some non-EU nationals with special skills.Rather than linger in roles of diminishing responsibility, some are looking to follow colleagues into the private sector.A few are tempted to move to a London civil service that may grow thanks to Brexit; others see little welcome from a British establishment they feel has done little for them.Amid anger, grief and uncertainty, there is deal of British stiff upper lip: \"It's not the end of the world,\" said one.\"No one's going to be helicoptered off the embassy roof, Saigon-style.\"We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

While there would be \"no tariffs on any goods\", Britain's vast services sector will suffer significant disruption. Banks in particular will lose their current access to the EU market, as the government gives up on its earlier plan for both sides to recognise each other's regulations.Mrs May faces a huge task trying to persuade EU negotiators to accept that the proposals are viable, while also keeping her Conservative party and Parliament on side. Time is running out to reach an exit agreement by the self-imposed October deadline, and Mrs May's plan has nothing new about the critical issue that is holding up progress: Avoiding customs checks at the border with Ireland.Even United States President Donald Trump took a view. Hours before he is due to touch down in Britain, he lobbed a verbal hand grenade at his host, saying Mrs May is not giving voters the Brexit deal they wanted.\"I would say Brexit is Brexit,\" Mr Trump said on Thursday at a news conference at the Nato summit in Brussels.\"The people voted to break it up so I would imagine that's what they would do, but maybe they're taking a different route - I don't know if that is what they voted for.\"Mrs May appealed to European negotiators to \"engage\" with her blueprint in the same spirit of respect that she said her government was taking toward the EU's own principles and red lines.\"Our proposal is comprehensive. It is ambitious. And it strikes the balance we need - between rights and obligations,\" Mrs May wrote in the foreword to the white paper.\"It would deliver a principled and practical Brexit that is in our national interest, and the UK's and the EU's mutual interest.\"Britain has also set out a complicated structure for supervision of the new relationship that would allow the two sides to discuss rule tweaks and include a mechanism for solving disputes.The British prime minister, European leaders and ministers would establish a \"governing body\" to set the direction of the future relationship, while a joint committee of officials would provide the day-to-day running of the agreement.Crucially, in a move that could anger Brexiteers, if there is a dispute over the interpretation of EU rules that Britain has agreed to adhere to, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) could have the final say.Details in the document include:- Britain will mirror EU rules for goods, as well as collecting tariffs on behalf of the bloc. In a sign of the imbalance in the relationship, Mrs May is not proposing the EU collect tariffs on behalf of Britain.- Britain proposes setting up new arrangements to allow it to have a voice - but not a vote - when EU introduces new regulations, and to facilitate the customs arrangement.- On rules of origin which govern whether goods are treated as EU-made, Britain is asking for no changes to current arrangements. This is crucial for manufacturers including car-makers, who otherwise face tariffs when exporting to the EU.- White paper sets out the parliamentary process after a deal has been agreed with the EU, and makes it clear that it will be conditional on support from lawmakers.- Britain wants to keep participating in EU agencies covering chemicals, aviation and medicines. It also proposed a close cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency and new arrangements for a closer association with the Euratom nuclear regulator than any other non-EU country.- Britain acknowledges its position on cooperation over the €10 billion (S$15.9 billion) Galileo satellite navigation programme is at odds with that of the EU. It maintains it wants to retain involvement in the project, in particular its Public Regulated Service - the encrypted navigation used for government and defence purpose, which the EU wants to exclude Britain from.- On immigration, the document says Britain will continue to be \"open and tolerant\", while ending the free movement of people. It stops short of saying EU citizens will be prioritised in any future immigration system.- Britain will also seek to ensure British and EU citizens can still use each other's health services when abroad, and foreign residents can still access their pension entitlements.

It involves Britain weaving its customs regime around the bloc's rules, and adopting identical regulations for industrial and agri-food goods.There was no such design for close ties for Britain's huge services sector, and London-based banks were warned they will lose their current levels of access to the EU market. New arrangements will seek to preserve the \"mutual benefits of integrated markets\".\"Today, in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,\" Mrs May said in a statement released by her office, with talks ongoing. \"Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve\".The plan represents a closer relationship to the EU single market than many pro-Brexit campaigners hoped for when Mrs May first set out her plans in January last year.The EU's chief negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier, said the bloc would assess the plans when they are fleshed out in a policy paper next week, to \"see if they are workable and realistic\".Uniting her Cabinet was a big win for Mrs May, after two years of very public splits. In a letter to members of her Conservative party, she said she had allowed ministers to speak out before, but \"collective responsibility is now fully restored\".Several euro-sceptic ministers yesterday publicly backed the premier, including leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. Pro-European MPs who had previously rebelled against Mrs May also offered their support for the plan, with Ms Anna Soubry saying it \"delivers a business-friendly Brexit\".Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Douglas Carswell, who co-founded the official Brexit campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, gave his backing.\"Read the detail and ask if this allows us to take back control. It does. Incrementally,\" he tweeted.\"A deal that guarantees us access to the (EU's single market) until such time as we chose regulatory divergence?... Sounds ok to me.\"But Mr Nigel Farage, the founder of the UK Independence Party and a key player in the Brexit vote, dismissed the plan as a \"sell-out\".Veteran euro-sceptic MP Bill Cash also told the BBC he was \"deeply disappointed\".Any final deal must be agreed in the House of Commons, where Mrs May has only a slim majority dependent on the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party.But before that, it must be agreed with the EU, which has repeatedly warned it will not accept \"cherry-picking\" elements of its single market. Mrs May was cautious on whether she will win the support of the EU, saying only that she had \"been talking to European leaders over the last week or so\".\"This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU and I look forward to it being received positively,\" she said.REUTERS, BLOOMBERG, NYTIMESWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

We want a deal and are working for a deal, but time is short,\" he said.He invited British negotiators back to Brussels next Monday.As May left the summit in the early hours, after all-night talks on migration, she confirmed she wanted the talks to step up a gear.\"We are ready to intensify and accelerate the pace of negotiations, I want to see that from the European Commission and the European Union as well,\" she said.The summit was originally viewed as a crucial point in the Brexit process, but it was sidelined due to the lack of progress and an EU row over how to deal with irregular migration.'NO DEAL' PREPARATIONSIn their summit conclusions, the other 27 leaders expressed \"concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved\" on the Irish issue.And they called on member states \"to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes\".Britain has said it will walk away from the talks if it cannot get a favourable deal, but says it expects an agreement.Critics say that in reality, Britain is ill-prepared for a \"no deal\" scenario.The negotiations have been stalled on how to avoid border checks between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain.London wants to leave the EU's customs union and single market but has yet to explain how this will not result in a \"hard\" Irish border, the prospect of which has sparked fears for the fragile peace on the island.Irish premier Leo Varadkar expressed disappointment at the summit on Thursday over the lack of progress, and warned Britain must be prepared to give ground on some of its demands.\"Any relationship that exists in the future between the EU and the UK isn't going to be one of absolute equals,\" he said.May has called for a bespoke trade deal with the EU after Brexit, but has yet to set out the details amid government in-fighting over how close to stay aligned with the bloc's rules.She will gather her warring ministers at her country retreat next week, likely Friday, to thrash out a deal and publish her policy paper shortly afterwards.Her government is clear on one area - the need for close security ties with the EU after Brexit.But Brussels has warned Britain cannot maintain the same access to EU-only police databases and institutions.Over a summit dinner late Thursday, May urged leaders to rip up the rule book, saying they should \"consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine\".It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"EU warns Britain 'time is short' to reach Brexit deal","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:53:29.571Z"},"time":null}

David Davis and one of his deputies resigned on Sunday (Jul 8) in a major blow for Prime Minister Theresa May as she tries to unite her party behind a plan to retain strong economic ties to the European Union even after leaving the bloc.\"The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one,\" Davis said in a letter to May.British media reported that junior Brexit minister Steve Baker had also stepped down.The resignations come two days after the cabinet approved the plan in a bid to unblock negotiations with Brussels at a meeting at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers outside London.Davis said the plan would \"make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real\".He was particularly critical of the proposal for a \"common rulebook\" to allow free trade in goods, saying this \"hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense\".\"I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions,\" he said, concluding that his post required \"an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript\".May replied in a letter saying that her Brexit plan \"will undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels to the United Kingdom\" and was in line with her commitment to leave the European single market and customs union.\"I would like to thank you warmly for everything you have done over the past two years as Secretary of State to shape our departure from the EU,\" she said.\"BREXIT IN NAME ONLY\"A long-time eurosceptic, Davis was appointed two years ago to head up the newly-created Department for Exiting the European Union after Britain voted to leave the European Union in a historic referendum.He became the face of Brexit, leading the British delegation in talks with Brussels, although his role was overshadowed in recent months as May and her aides took an increasingly key role in the negotiations.The 69-year-old had reportedly threatened to quit several times over a perceived lack of firmness in Britain's negotiating stance but had remained strictly loyal to the prime minister in public.The resignation comes just hours before May was due in parliament to explain her plan for Britain to adopt EU rules on goods after Brexit, amid anger from MPs in her own party who want a cleaner break.Conservative MP Peter Bone said Davis had \"done the right thing\", adding: \"The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.\"Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: \"This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.\"May's plan would create a free trade area with the EU for goods, to protect supply chains in areas such as manufacturing, while maintaining flexibility for Britain's dominant service sector.It is unclear whether Brussels will accept this, after repeatedly warning Britain it cannot \"cherry-pick\" bits of its single market.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit supporter, was widely reported to have described the plan as a \"turd\" before agreeing to support it.SPECIAL FORCES TRAININGDavis, a sharp operator and a gut-instinct politician, was a \"Leave\" campaigner in the referendum on Britain's EU membership.He was well acquainted with the Brussels beat: he was Europe minister between 1994 and 1997 as the European issue tore apart then Conservative prime minister John Major's government.Born to a single mother and brought up on a public housing estate in London, Davis went on to study molecular and computer sciences at Warwick University in central England.From there, he took a higher degree in business at the London Business School, attending the advanced management programme at elite US university Harvard while pursuing a career on the board of sugar giant Tate and Lyle.Davis also served as a reservist in the Special Air Service, the British army's elite special force unit.Noted for his love of climbing and flying, his ascent in politics began in 1987 when he was elected to parliament, representing a seat in northern England.He became a government whip ensuring party discipline and later, as Major's Europe minister, delighted in the nickname \"Monsieur Non\".Davis then chaired the powerful public accounts committee in the lower House of Commons from 1997 to 2001.He ran for the Conservative leadership in 2001 and came fourth, but was made party chairman.Davis was the front-runner in the 2005 Conservative Party leadership contest, but lost out to David Cameron, shedding momentum after a party conference speech fell flat.He stayed on as the party's home affairs spokesman, but dramatically resigned his seat to force a by-election in protest at the Labour government's erosion of civil liberties.He won the seat back but the move cost him his place in Cameron's top team.When the Conservatives returned to power in 2010, he never got a government post and spent his time on the backbenches campaigning on civil liberties issues.When Cameron resigned after defeat in the Brexit referendum, Davis was appointed back in government by May, Cameron's replacement.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"Britain's Brexit minister David Davis steps

If opposition parties join them, May would have a major crisis on her hands.At the same time, the prime minister is also testing her plan with the EU, as Brexit negotiations resumed in Brussels on Monday.SPLIT THE PARTYMay spent the weekend defending her plan, and did so again in a speech at Farnborough airshow Monday, insisting it would protect trade in goods with the EU and avoid border checks in Ireland.She said it would allow Britain to control migration, end the jurisdiction of EU courts and forge its own trade policy - despite US President Donald Trump saying the prime minister's plan could \"kill\" a US-UK trade deal.Eurosceptics believe it keeps Britain too close to the EU, and Davis, the former Brexit secretary, warned in the Financial Times on Monday it would deny the government the \"freedom to run our own economy\".\"It would be profoundly dangerous to leave the EU but remain subject to regulations made by institutions in which we have no say,\" he wrote.In an article in the Mail on Sunday, May urged eurosceptics to keep their \"eyes on the prize\", warning: \"If we don't, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\"Rees-Mogg, the leader of the powerful European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs, said May still had time to change course and warned the current plan would split the party.\"The inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it to keep the party united,\" he told BBC television.Pro-Europeans also dislike May's plan, particular her goal to have looser ties with the EU for Britain's dominant services sector.A cross-party group of MPs have tabled amendments to Monday's bill - the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, also known as the customs bill - seeking a new customs union with the EU.But one MP told AFP they would likely not push it to a vote on Monday, instead waiting to see what the eurosceptics do.They can hold their fire for Tuesday when the same amendment is tabled to a separate trade bill.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"Ex-minister backs new Brexit vote as eurosceptics pressure May","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:55:01.285Z"},"time":null}

It could lead to panic buying in the shops as people hedge their bets and stockpile tinned and long-life foods \"just in case\".With growing concern about the fate of Prime Minister Theresa May's blueprint for a future trade deal with the EU, people from the proverbial \"man in the street\" to politicians and academics are posing the question, could a no-deal scenario become a reality.Time is running out as Britain heads towards March 29, 2019, the day the country ceases to be an EU member.Leave supporting Conservative MPs are planning a number of amendments to upcoming related legislation due to be debated in the coming weeks in the House of Commons.With May heading a minority government, her Brexit plans have to be navigated through potentially stormy waters in parliament, and also clear hurdles not only with EU negotiators in Brussels but with the other 27 member states.One-time adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, macroeconomist Patrick Minford, Professor of Applied Economics at Cardiff Business School, told Xinhua Friday: \"I really cannot see the May proposals as viable at all. Either a No Deal or a retreat to a Canada plus deal seem only possible outcomes.\"Minford cited fury among Conservative ranks as another issue for May.Meanwhile, Professor Anthony Glees, Director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, warned the chaotic political situation in Britain could lead to further chaos.Glees told Xinhua: \"What my sources indicate (and I've just attended a meeting is that the Chequers agreement is really still a compromise between the Remain and Brexit wings of the Cabinet. It has allowed both to sign up to the deal, but as a practical proposal and workable plan it is fraught with problems.\"He said Britain will have to decide either to leave the EU altogether or effectively stay in, extending the 'Common Rule Book' to services as well as goods, that is to the 80 percent of the economy and not just the 20 percent of it.\"Why give car manufacturing advantages over financial services, for example, added Glees. \"This just does not make sense, is unfair and will lead big financial services to pull out of the UK, full stop. So if we do this deal on goods, it'll have to be on services as well.\"What that will mean is that Britain either leaves, full stop, or stays in but without any ability to shape the rules, he said.Glees added: \"At the moment, despite this not being what most of the two sides want, the most likely outcome seems to be a hard and even a cliff-edge Brexit, what the Brexit ideologues would call a 'diamond Brexit'. That in turn would lead to twenty years of upheaval and a massive decline in the wealth and the standard of living of the people of the UK. Did the 52 percent vote for that? I don't think so.\"Glees said when the newly published White Paper states that \"exit from the EU will provide considerable additional opportunities for British business through potentially ambitious new trade arrangements and meaningful trade deals that play to the strengths of the UK economy', this is so clearly the best civil servants could do with what was in essence a totally bad job. These words mean nothing hard, they are basically platitudes.Glees said he believes May now wants to take the best possible alternative available, a negotiation based on Chequers but which allows the EU27 to make significant inroads into it in return for further concessions on services, and call it 'Brexit'.\"She will try to explain that this is, in fact, what the 52 percent voted, nothing less than leaving the EU but nothing more either,\" said Glees.

Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs were quick to voice their concerns.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is leader of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservatives, told the BBC early morning Today program: \"It is possible that this deal is worse than a no deal Brexit.\"Rees-Mogg, once spoken of as a successor to May as prime minister, said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals, adding: \"If it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative party's manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.\"Media reports Saturday said May had told her cabinet ministers they were now have to adhere to the convention of cabinet responsibility. This would prevent any of them from speaking against the proposals agreed at her Chequers meeting. It was also seen, according to the media, as a stark warning to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that he would lose his job is he makes any outspoken comments.John Longworth, one-time director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and co-chairman of the pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave, pulled no punches with his message, saying: \"Those who campaigned for Leave but have not resigned will see their reputations in tatters.\"Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Longworth accused May of totally misleading the 17.4 million British people who voted leave, \"and left it as late as possible to reveal that she remains a stubborn Remainer\".\"We are faced with becoming a vassal state of the EU, they have us exactly where they want us - unable to compete, taking enormous quantities of their products at inflated prices, protected from global competition by the fortress Europe tariff and regulatory wall and impeded from doing trade deals around the globe,\" added Longworth.Elsewhere there was a sigh of relief that the government finally had a proposed deal to present to Brussels.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, who is Leader of the House of Commons, said on her social media site: \"As a passionate Brexiteer with huge optimism about future as a free trading nation, I agree with the PM (May) that keeping the UK together is vital.

The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the British automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership,\" the spokesperson added.\"There is no credible Plan B for frictionless customs arrangements, nor is it realistic to expect that new trade deals can be agreed with the rest of the world that will replicate the immense value of trade with the EU. Government must rethink its position on the customs union.\"Earlier on Thursday the largest British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) issued a bleak warning on the dangers of an unsatisfactory Brexit trade deal.Dr Ralf Speth, JLR chief executive, warned that uncertainty over trading arrangements with the EU threatened future investment plans by JLR in Britain.\"We urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees,\" Speth warned.He added: \"A bad Brexit deal would cost JLR more than 1.2 billion pounds (1.59 billion U.S. dollars) profit each year.\"As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile; we have spent around 50 billion pounds in Britain in the past five years with plans for a further 80 billion pounds in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.\"JLR, a British subsidiary of Indian Motor firm Tata Motors, makes about 600,000 cars a year, the largest total of all British car firms, and its largest export market is the EU.The JLR warning comes after a similar bleak warning at the end of June from Airbus, the aeroplane manufacturer, which has significant operations in Britain, where it has several factories which specialize in the high technology production of wings.Airbus warned that it employs 14,000 workers in Britain and supports up to 100,000 other jobs, but these could be under threat if its sophisticated cross-border supply-chains were disrupted by tariff payments and delays with documentation under post-Brexit trade arrangements.

Instead high ranking negotiators from both sides will seek a way through the current deadlock.On Friday the negotiations will switch to a proposed future relationship between Britain and the EU's remaining 27 member states after next March.Meanwhile, new figures Monday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the Irish Republic accounts for 27 percent of Northern Ireland's international export trade. The United States accounted for 25 percent, making it Northern Ireland's second biggest international export partner.Northern Ireland's biggest export across the border into Ireland was food and live animals, particularly dairy products, which represented 33 percent of total exports to the Irish Republic.More than two thirds (68 percent) of exporting businesses in Northern Ireland were small companies employing up to 49 workers.Commentators in Britain and Ireland have warned that a no-deal Brexit could have serious consequences for industries that have extensive cross-border supply chains.Last month May made her first visit to the Irish border since the 2016 Brexit referendum. She held talks with workers and business representatives from both sides of the border.During her two-day visit May reaffirmed her commitment to a Brexit that avoids a hard border and protects the Belfast Agreement which brought to an end decades of conflict and troubles in Northern Ireland.In a government white paper Britain has ruled out any kind of hard border.\"Daily journeys will continue to be seamless and there will be no checks or infrastructure at the border to get in the way of this,\" said May.\"I've also been clear we will not accept the imposition of any border down the Irish Sea and we will preserve the integrity of the UK's internal market and Northern Ireland's place within it,\" she added.Media reports in Brussels said later that EU negotiator Barnier had rejected key elements of Britain's new trade proposals outlined in May's blueprint for a future post-Brexit trading relationship with the bloc.Barnier made clear British offers to collect customs duties for the EU as part of efforts to avoid friction on Northern Ireland's new EU border had failed to convince already skeptical Europeans.Both sides are aiming to have draft deal in place by October, but observers fear a no-deal outcome is looking increasingly possible.Last week Britain's international trade secretary Liam Fox said the chance of a no-deal Brexit is growing, blaming the \"intransigence\" of the European Commission. Fox put the chance of failing to come to an agreement at \"60-40\", but 10 Downing Street has insisted the British government remains confident it can get a good deal with Brussels.

He said he did not expect the bill, or another key bill on trade due to be debated on Tuesday, to be blocked outright by the 650-member parliament.\"I'm sure Theresa May does not want to split the Conservative Party and therefore she will find that the inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it (the Brexit policy) to keep the party united,\" Rees-Mogg said.\"We'll have an idea of the numbers, I suppose, at 10 o'clock on Monday evening.\"Reuters\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          Parliament vote to reveal extent of anger over May's Brexit plan\n        ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:57:25.922Z"},"time":"AYANA Komodo ResortOnly 1 Hour Flight from Bali!

They walked off the job because they disagreed with Prime Minister Theresa May’s vision of Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the European Union following their March 2019 separation.Johnson and Davis, both enthusiastic supporters of the Leave campaign in Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership, favor a clean break and arms-length relationship, while May recently revealed her preference for a “soft Brexit” and close future ties. May has given Johnson’s old job to Jeremy Hunt, who had been health secretary. Davis’s role will be handled by former housing minister Dominic Raab.The nation will now wait to see whether the turmoil is over, or if there will be further resignations and disquiet within the Conservative Party and whether there will be a leadership challenge.May passed the first test when she chaired a meeting of her reshuffled cabinet at 10 Downing Street.She is now calling on her party to unite, or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn and his opposition Labour Party grabbing power.If May is to face a leadership challenge, it must be mounted through the influential 1922 committee of backbenchers, which comprises ordinary Conservative Party MPs. The committee could demand a “no-confidence” vote if 15 percent of the party’s MPs, currently 48 people, officially call for one.So far, no such challenge has been mounted and the BBC’s assistant political editor, Norman Smith, says it looks as if discontented Tory MPs would rather negotiate with May than bring down her government.“There is a genuine weariness (and) horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program on Tuesday.Former Conservative Party leader Michael Howard said on the same program that it would be “extremely foolish and extremely ill-advised” if Tory MPs triggered a leadership contest.“And I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out,” he added.Professor Jon Tonge from the University of Liverpool, told Xinhua news agency that May would probably win a leadership challenge anyway, if one was to materialize.Meanwhile, Malcolm Rifkind, who served as a cabinet minister under prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, said in an opinion piece in The Guardian newspaper that he is “relaxed” about the resignations and more optimistic than he has been for a long time that a good Brexit agreement is within reach.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was not as charitable, saying Johnson and Davis had abandoned a “sinking ship” and that the Tory Party was bitterly divided.Xinhua said May had told a rowdy House of Commons in the wake of the resignations that Johnson and Davis were wrong in their assessments of what the British people want from Brexit negotiations.She said the soft Brexit she favors is “the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people, and it is the right Brexit deal for Britain”.\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          UK Tory party hit by new round of Brexit turmoil\n        ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:57:38.835Z"},"time":"AYANA Komodo ResortOnly 1 Hour Flight from Bali!

The country has been the worst performing economy in the EU in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2016.BDI director Dieter Kempf said Britain would be best advised to emulate the quasi-EU membership models of Norway and Switzerland to avert further economic harm and protect the current rights which its own citizens enjoy throughout the EU.Though not member states of the EU, Norway and Switzerland are both members of the EU Schengen travel area and customs union, abide by its four freedoms of goods, services, capital and people, and are subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (CJEU).So far, London has rejected all of these propositions and instead called for developing a vague \"bespoke\" agreement with the EU. However, the European Commission and European heads of state are increasingly skeptical about the feasibility and desirability of such an outcome.A key sticking point in negotiations remains the land border between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU after Brexit, and the UK's Northern Ireland, an issue on which the British cabinet is also split internally.The extent to which Britain continues to mirror EU regulations after Brexit will have far-reaching implications for British citizens and could potentially eliminate their right to move freely throughout the bloc in search of work.\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          British applications for German citizenship continue to soar after Brexit\n        ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:58:08.820Z"},"time":"AYANA Komodo ResortOnly 1 Hour Flight from Bali!

What the government comes back with, not what was promised in the referendum, will be the real deal. It should not be a done deal.\"\"Brexit will affect everybody in the country, which is why it should not be left to 650 politicians to decide our future but 65 million people. That is why so many are demanding a People's Vote on the final Brexit deal.\"The British parliament's only Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said: \"This is too big and too important to be determined solely by politicians. If the public demand a People's Vote, politicians will fall in line.\"Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said:\"It may seem like the odds are stacked against us as a movement, but fighting for what you believe in is never easy. We are short on time, but we have people power on our side. Together, are on the verge of something extraordinary.\"Actor Stewart said in a media interview Sunday that if people voted to reject the exit deal, Britain would simply stay in the EU.He said the group does not oppose the result of the 2016 EU referendum or call for a second referendum.Stewart added: \"As time has gone by, the information that we are receiving about the terms and conditions of that separation are quite unlike the terms and conditions that were spoken of so loosely during the 2016 campaign.\"Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, responding to the new campaign, said the people's vote had already taken place, adding: \"They voted with a substantial majority to leave the EU.

Roads were flooded and there was transport chaos. But the next day, people woke up to something even more shocking.Out of the 72 percent of eligible voters who turned out to take part in the referendum nationwide, a slim majority - 51.9 percent - had voted to leave the trading bloc. London, by contrast, had voted 60 percent in favor of remaining in the EU. The process known as Brexit had begun.Fast forward two years and the outlook remains unsettled. Then-prime minister David Cameron, the man who called the referendum, resigned as soon as its result became clear. His successor, Theresa May, who as home secretary had made a speech in April 2016 in which she said \"remaining inside the European Union does make us more secure, it does make us more prosperous, and it does make us more influential beyond our shores\", had inherited the task of overseeing Britain's departure from the EU, which is scheduled for the end of March 2019. This is proving to be a spectacularly complex process.The pronouncement of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox that Britain's post-Brexit free-trade deal with the EU would be the \"easiest in human history\" has proved to be anything but, and given the uncertainty over what divorce terms Britain will manage to secure, many international companies seem to be erring on the side of caution and drawing up plans to relocate from the UK to mainland Europe.Frankfurt, home of Germany's financial sector, seems to be benefiting, and in April The Independent newspaper quoted Tarek al-Wazir, the economy minister for the state of Hesse, where the city is situated, as saying \"we've got 18 entities that have committed\". He was confident more would follow.Morgan Stanley has confirmed it is moving up to 10 percent of its United Kingdom workforce, and Goldman Sachs has also shown signs of having itchy feet, gradually increasing its presence in mainland Europe.Given the uncertainty that surrounds Britain's future relationship with its nearest neighbors, and the unpredictable behavior of its previous best friend, the United States, the country is casting its eyes around for new trading partners and friends for the coming years. And few nations look quite as attractive as China.Fortunately for Britain, the cultivation of this relationship is not beginning from a standing start. Long before Brexit was a reality, President Xi Jinping had already made a high-profile trip to the UK and met Cameron, ushering in what is known as the \"golden era\" of Sino-British relations. And, early this year, May visited China to strengthen those ties.On the face of it, Britain would seem to be in a strong position. Xinhua News Agency this year reported that Britain is China's second-largest trading partner within the EU, and that China is the UK's second-largest non-EU trading partner.Trade between the two countries rose in 2017 to $79 billion, an increase of almost 6.2 percent on the previous year. And British exports to China went up 19.4 percent.Tony Samuels, a lawyer and notary public with Howard Kennedy LLP in the City of London financial district, has worked closely with many of China's leading financial institutions.He said that, despite the challenges posed by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, London has always held a special allure for Chinese individuals and companies, and he expects this relationship to flourish in the years to come.\"London has always been very attractive,\" he said. \"Pre-Brexit they were buying up lots of residential and residential block developments. For example, the area around the American embassy in Vauxhall was being consumed by the Chinese very quickly. They're still buying now, but not in such big numbers.\"That's because the Chinese are being wary. They don't plan five or 10 years ahead like some countries. With China, it's 20 or 30 years. It's all about capital appreciation - they're in it for the long term, so they'll come to London to buy serious sites for serious money and stay for the long term.\"Bigger pictureIn a turbulent world, the ability to look at the bigger picture, and stability, are key elements to ensuring security - and Samuels says these are factors that make Brexit an opportunity for Sino-British ties to become stronger than ever.\"With or without Brexit, Shanghai deals more with London than anywhere else in the world, so pre-or post-Brexit, China is crucial to our trade going forward,\" Samuels said.\" The EU and USA are our main trading partners at the moment, but my guess is that in 15 or so years, China might overtake them both.\"If a country's mood can be interpreted in any way by its movements, then the prospects for London's long history of good relations with China are encouraging.Earlier this month, city development 5 Broadgate was bought by Hong Kong's CK Asset Holdings for 1 billion pounds, meaning it joins such iconic London landmarks as 20 Fenchurch Street (the skyscraper also known as the Walkie Talkie) and 122 Leadenhall Street (another skyscraper, aka the Cheesegrater) in being Chinese-owned.Perhaps even more symbolic than these purchases, was the Chinese government's May announcement that its new London embassy will be on the site of the former Royal Mint, close to the financial heart of the city and the Tower of London, one of the capital's most famous landmarks. The past, it would appear, has a role in shaping the future - even if just now no one is entirely sure what that future looks like.Mark Tucker, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, said: \"Establishing a long-term strategic plan for trade and investment relationships with China is vital, in our view, to clarify and secure the UK's place in this world.\"The UK's relationship with China requires a long-term approach. This long-term strategic approach will require a different mindset. The Belt and Road Initiative lays the foundation for sustainable growth for decades to come,\" said Tucker.So, while the storm clouds that accompanied the arrival of Brexit may not yet have fully cleared, Samuels says all the signals he is receiving are that its outcome will be an opportunity for both countries, and the long-term forecast is for much improved conditions.Cecily Liu contributed to this article.\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          China helping clear Brexit storm clouds\n        ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:58:47.833Z"},"time":"AYANA Komodo ResortOnly 1 Hour Flight from Bali!

The upper house of parliament later approved the bill, paving the way for it to become law after gaining formal \"Royal Assent\" from the Queen.May said in a statement that the bill's passage was a crucial step in delivering Brexit, and more details of proposed future links with the EU would be published in the coming weeks.But the battle over the EU withdrawal bill, her Brexit blueprint, may be a taste of things to come. May needs to get several other bills through parliament to prepare Britain for life outside the EU, a momentous change to its trading and political relationships after decades in the bloc.Some of her opponents on Brexit may simply have decided to keep their powder dry for later fights on issues such as future trading ties and customs arrangements with the bloc before Britain's scheduled departure in March next year.Six Conservatives still voted against the government. But for now, May will be relieved to have overcome another potential crisis over her proposal for the role of parliament, should she fail to negotiate an exit agreement with the EU or if lawmakers reject any deal she returns with from Brussels.Talks with the bloc have all but stalled, with May's top team of ministers at odds over plans for future trading relations with the EU, which businesses complain makes them unable to plan their investment decisions.Reuters\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          May faces down pro-EU rebel lawmakers to win Brexit vote\n        ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:59:00.648Z"},"time":"AYANA Komodo ResortOnly 1 Hour Flight from Bali!

Last year, a record 1 million electric cars were sold, taking the global stock to 3 million, according to the International Energy Agency.In Britain, the number of registered plug-in vehicles has risen from 3,500 in 2013 to more than 160,000 this year. Electric black cabs made by the China-owned London Electric Vehicle Company have been deployed on the streets of the capital, and will soon be joined by electric double-decker buses made by Chinese-automobile manufacturer BYD.In China, more than 30 million electric two-wheelers and 100,000 electric buses were sold in 2017, where 1.2 million electric passenger-cars already hum along the roads.While China is leading the world in electric vehicle take-up, the United Kingdom is competing with its neighbors to head up electric vehicle production in Europe.Germany, Britain, and France are the three largest carmakers in Europe, and all face radical changes in their industrial infrastructure as an increasing number of nations commit to phasing out internal combustion engines.But a pending exit from the European Union, and the recent channeling of billions of dollars of electric vehicle investment from large automakers toward China, has cast doubt on Britain’s prospects to lead the charge in Europe.“Brexit creates difficulty for the UK to lead in e-mobility,” said Julia Poliscanova, manager of clean vehicles at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, which is also called the EFT\u0026E. “The UK would like to position itself as the hub for electric vehicle production in the future. But, if they are outside of the bigger European market, and if there are tariffs, it will be very difficult to attract companies to develop products.”Last year, 1.67 million cars were manufactured in the UK, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and only 20,000 of those were electric. The UK highlighted plans to increase production in its industrial strategy published in November.But last week, the British government received a stark warning from the country’s largest car manufacturer. Ralf Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company would face profit losses of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.59 billion) a year should the government fail to negotiate “tariff-free access and frictionless trade” with the EU.Speth said a “bad Brexit deal” could force the carmaker out of Britain and put 40,000 jobs at risk.His comments also suggested that Jaguar Land Rover could pull the handbrake on plans to relocate manufacturing of the company’s electric vehicle, the Jaguar I-Pace, from Austria to the UK — a move that was supposed to bring 10,000 jobs to Britain.“Electrification and connectivity offer significant economic and productivity opportunities — get Brexit wrong and British people, businesses, and broader society lose the chance to lead in smart mobility,” Speth said.Prior to the Brexit vote, the UK looked well-placed to compete in electric vehicle production.Big car-producing nations in Europe were put on notice in 2010 when Nissan, one of the world’s largest car makers, announced it would produce the all-electric Nissan Leaf in the UK. It was a huge coup, positioning the UK right where it wanted to be — Nissan would make the world’s best-selling electric car in Tennessee for the North American market, in Japan for Asia, and in the UK for Europe.“We can achieve our aim of making the UK a world-leader in ultra-low carbon vehicles,” said Peter Mandelson, who was Britain’s business secretary at the time.British automaker Aston Martin followed suit last year, announcing plans to produce an electric vehicle in the UK beginning in 2019.Last summer, BMW announced it would assemble its new electric Mini next year at its Cowley site, near Oxford in the UK, with motors built in Germany. The German automaker said it did not ask for any Brexit-related assurances from the British government when making its decision.\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          Will Brexit park the UK's electric vehicle industry?\n        ","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T17:59:32.167Z"},"time":null}

Putin leaves the former Soviet city and heads to China on Monday, four days after pro-sanction U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Anti-Russia conspiracy theorists have pointed to a number of media operations within the E.U. that promote European skepticism. Other critics argue that Russia’s government officially supports politicians or non-profits that indirectly support leaders who are friendly to Russian causes. It is unclear why Russia would be interested in breaking up the European Union, as that does not necessarily pose any threat to the existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO is the seen as the biggest existential threat to Russia, though this too is debatable.Putin laid to rest this weekend that Russians are celebrating the Brexit vote. Some 52% of Great Britain citizens voted to leave the European Union, with a high 72% voter turnout.Putin told guests at the SCO summit that the referendum outcome “showed how the British are unhappy with the level of security in the country…and against subsidizing other economies. I think it is understandable why this happened,” he said. “No one likes to feed and subsidize weaker countries and be a care taker all the time,” Interfax quoted him saying on Friday. “They clearly want to be more independent from Brussels,” he said.Putin said that media reports about U.K politicians saying how he would be happy about a Brexit were “improper attempt to influence public opinion.”“As we can see, that had no impact on the results,” he said, further criticizing the British press and some politicians. “We do not expect this to result in a global catastrophe,” Putin added.U.K. voters rejected the European Union, not to be in cahoots with Russia, but because they were against being ruled — on some matters — by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. Steve Forbes pointed this out in an op-ed here on Friday. When the economic crisis hit Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, the response of Germany and Brussels was to demand austerity, “but it was of the pro-big-government, anti-private-sector variety,” he writes. Taxes went up and some public services were cut, but the government sector was spared. Ireland refused to listen to Brussels and kept its corporate tax rate of 12.5%, recovering far faster than the others and actually voting to remain in the European Union.The second, if not biggest blunder, was immigration policies regarding Syrian refugees. Angela Merkel’s decision “to let hundreds of thousands of Mideast refugees into a continent that has badly handled the integration of past immigrants–notoriously letting virtual self-governing areas arise that became a haven for terrorists–was the breaking point,” Forbes writes.These two egregious errors have already led to the rise of nationalist politics. Merkel’s own coalition is splintering. The most popular political figure there is a member of the leftist Green Party. The second-most popular is the foreign minister, who says Germany must come closer to working with Russia.Russia investors, of course, love this idea. They would like to see sanctions removed.But even the idea that Brexit makes it easier for Europe to scramble for friends, even “frenemies”, Russia’s food industry, which has banned imports from Europe in retaliation for sanctions, has invested billions in upgrading production and creating new produce markets for home-grown goods. Russia faces a double edged sword in the removal of sanctions as it is. But seeing how the E.U. voted to extend sanctions out til January 2017, both sides have at least six months to figure out what the E.U. without the U.K. looks like politically. And whether or not this is of any benefit to Russia’s economy.Show your support by disabling ad-block (How)Buy AD-FREE ACCESS here, for only $19 / yrThanks for your supportWe’re winning thanks to YOU!Disabling adblock for a specific site just takes a couple of clicks.Usually it is as simple as clicking on the adblock icon in your browser, and choosing the ‘disable on this page or domain’ option.If that doesn’t work this wikihow article gives more detail:  https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-AdBlockThank you for your support!(more info) Join us! | About | Contact | Investors | Crowdfunding | RSS\n\n","header":"What Putin Really Thinks About Brexit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:00:06.198Z"},"time":"Wed, Jun 29, 2016"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e85bf6dba1b08b5a8ad3d"},"url":"https://russia-insider.com/en/russian-interference-brexit-dispelling-myth/ri22642","content":"The RussiaHoax mental disorder is starting to infect UK elites as they look for excuses for why the public is rejecting themFor the last 18 months, Western politics or, more accurately, the regnant parties, have been busily engaged in disseminating a conspiracy theory. This theory goes something like this: the people keep voting against us, time and again, therefore they must have been duped by propaganda emanating from the Kremlin, where lies today’s bogeyman.If you were to believe the mainstream media outlets in the United Kingdom, such as state-owned propaganda machine the BBC, or Murdoch-owned Sky News, then Russia is the new Hitler, the reason your children don’t have a future, the reason your currency is hemorrhaging value and so on and so forth.Of course, when the ruling elites of the UK surprisingly lost the referendum to decide the country’s membership of the European Union, they fell back on this most lazy of excuses. It has to be said that Russia has not been the only target of their frustrated autopsy; they first blamed the peoples’ stupidity, and the alleged misinformation spread by British ‘leave’ campaigners.But since these excuses have been found wanting, they’ve turned their attention back to this Russia conspiracy, which becomes all the more devious as they piggyback the mass hysteria across the pond in the United States regarding Russia’s alleged interference in the US Presidential Election – which has since been disproven as the pernicious conspiracy theory that it unquestionably is.Now, more and more, Europhile MPs on both sides of the political divide, in an overwhelmingly Europhile Westminster bubble, are fanning the flames of suspicion and conspiracy by alleging that Russia and, particularly, the Kremlin, interfered in Britain’s democratic process.Indeed, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee summoned representatives of multimedia companies Google and Facebook, demanding that they report back on any ‘Russian meddling’ in the referendum campaign. Chair of this Select Committee is Conservative Party – and ‘remain’ supporting MP Damian Collins – who apparently seems to think we’re living in East Berlin, circa 1984.Earlier this month, the same Select Committee ventured out from their mansions to hear 5 hours of testimony in Washington D.C, which included an hour each from representatives of Facebook, Google and Twitter.But despite their exhaustive efforts to legitimise their crazed ramblings about Kremlin conspiracies, they have turned up precisely zero evidence that the Russian state even paid any attention to the vote, let alone masterminded a high-tech psychological operation to somehow sway the outcome. A Facebook investigation on behalf of the British Electoral Commission found that ‘a handful’ of accounts ‘possibly linked to Russia’ spent a grand total of £0.70 on Brexit-related adverts, which subsequently appeared in all of 200 peoples’ News Feeds. Bear in mind that the vote was won by a margin of over a million votes. The enquiry in Washington brought further disappointment to those intent on deflecting the blame for losing the referendum, as the testimony of Twitter, Facebook and Google representatives concluded that there was ‘no evidence’ of Russian interference in the EU referendum.The extent of the establishment’s substantiation of their assertion that Russia interfered with the EU referendum comes in the form of a highly partisan report compiled by the US Democratic Party – who themselves are reeling from losing the election to Donald Trump - which claimed that ‘questions had been raised about the source of wealth’ of some ‘leave’ donors – of course, the Guardian article reporting this “news” remained coy as to by whom these questions were raised.The same report claims that prominent Brexit supporter Nigel Farage ‘criticised sanctions against Russia’ and ‘provided flattering assessments of Russian President Putin’. To address the first point, it’s important to remember that the British Electoral Commission demands, by law, that all funding of election and referendum campaigns is totally transparent, and there is no inkling of a suggestion that the ‘leave’ campaigners fell foul of this high standard. There is, however, plenty of evidence that the ‘remain’ campaigners were in flagrant violation of a number of spending laws, which of course have been overlooked to suit a political agenda.The second point, regarding what Mr Farage may or may not have said about Russia, is laughable to the point that it isn’t worth refuting. However, in the interest of thoroughness, I will briefly address it. Of course Nigel Farage, an economic libertarian and self-professed Thatcherite, criticised sanctions against Russia, in the same way that the Iron Lady herself refused to endorse sanctions against the Apartheid regime in South Africa, or the white government of Rhodesia in the 1980s. This is a point of purely ideological persuasion and offers no insight into what the people behind the statements think about the subjects of their musings. And it must also be noted that Mr Farage did not say anything flattering about Russia. In fact, he clearly stated that ‘Putin’s Russia is not a place I’d like to live’, and has maintained such criticisms throughout his political career. At the end of the day, one must remember that Nigel Farage, for all his great attributes, is fundamentally a liberal who seeks to uphold the perverse values of modernity, thus he has little ideological commonality with Putin’s Russia.Throughout all of this lies a theme, a recurring theme, of deflection. The root of the liberal Europhile’s obsession with the Russian bogeyman can be found in their insecurities about their own inadequacies. They simply cannot bring themselves to admit that maybe, just maybe, the wisdom of the masses is slowly coming to reject their liberal, globalist ideology. To them, the alternative to passive acceptance of the present Zeitgeist is too terrifying to acknowledge, therefore they adopt this rather pathological and conspiratorial mindset as a new means of legitimising their power.But behind this understandable if not condonable pathology, there lies a deeper, more pernicious deflection. I am, of course, referring to their own special interest parties, their own sly backhanders, their own attempts to pervert democracy as popular will. Fortunately for them, the media moguls have decided that only their opponents may be suspected of foul play, whilst any such suggestions leveled against the establishment’s side are utterly preposterous. Yet, oftentimes, one finds them to be the guiltiest of all!For instance, it has recently been revealed that Jewish-American billionaire George Soros has donated £400,000 to a campaign called ‘Best for Britain’, launched on 26th April 2017 with the expressed purpose of stopping Brexit. His sizeable donation was only revealed earlier this month, at the same time it was revealed that Russian agitators may have spent a grand total of £0.70 on Brexit-related advertising. Yet all the focus remains on the Russian bogeyman!Not a soul dares raise the issue of Jewish interference, or American interference, in the same way. Similarly, nobody cried foreign interference when Guiana-born multi-millionaire Investment Manager Gina Miller (born Gina Singh) took the UK government through the courts in an attempt to stop the Brexit process. Interestingly, Gina Miller is known to have pumped large sums of money into her efforts to prevent the peoples’ will from being realised, and is known to be the founder of the Soros-friendly Best for Britain – yet still, nobody dares speak of foreign interference.As an aside, but a point of interest, nobody ever seems interested in the British government’s role in or funding for the so-called Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine that took place in 2014, despite the evidence that the United States and the European Union have pumped billions into this anti-Russia campaign. Then-Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond openly defended the UK government’s role in ‘supplying non-lethal aid’ to the EU puppet regime in Kiev. However, in the eyes of the media elites, Russian trolls spending £0.70 on adverts for an election campaign is more a matter of public interest than the British government actively supporting a violent coup d’état in a foreign country, with the expressed desire to turn said country’s government away from friendship with Russia.  It seems obvious to me and, I’m sure, anybody else observing this sequence of events that the whole “Russia did it” allegation is a façade. It’s merely a game of smoke and mirrors played by the ruling elites, which is, 1.) to direct attention away from their own failings and, 2.) a projection of their own complicity in undermining democracy.However, the ramifications of such pathological disinformation campaigns are of a much greater significance than the eternally myopic apparatchiks of the regnant liberal parties can possibly comprehend. For it is not simply a matter of harmlessly deflecting blame from one’s own shortcomings, but in fact it’s a matter jeopardising a very serious international relationship with one of the world’s foremost superpowers.What do the Russians think when they see their country wrongly accused of espionage and subversion? Of course, one would expect the Russian government to be fairly hostile to that of the United Kingdom, given the latter’s support for unwarranted sanctions against her country, yet up until this point the Russian government have continued to extend an olive branch in good faith.Allegations of subversion and espionage are very serious accusations indeed. Despite it being of the greatest geopolitical wisdom for the United Kingdom to ally herself with a strong Russia – not to mention a useful means of throwing off the American yoke – her leaders seem unconcerned by the prospect of irreparably damaging relations between the two old nations, if they’ve even taken the time to consider such a consequence at all.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Let’s just take three socio-cultural phenomena as examples.The first is Saudi Arabia. This country is widely recognized as the guardian of Islam’s holiest places and the protector of said religion.  It is also the number one supporter of a terrorist group actively engaged in killing thousands of Muslims in the name of Allah.By any measure this is clearly illogical.Secondly, if one studies Cultural Anthropology one learns about a social phenomenon called “Hypodescent”. This term refers to an American practice common in the old racist South whereby a child born of an interracial relationship between a white person and black person automatically would be labelled and identified as simply “black” rather than of mixed race. The reasoning was that any combination of “white” blood and “black” blood resulted in the contamination of pure “white blood” thusly degrading the bloodline and producing an inferior member of the species. And yet in America we refer to Barack Obama – the child of a mixed marriage between a white mother and black father – as the first “black president”.  Though this is clearly racist, no one dares point it out.This is simply illogical.Thirdly…In Great Britain recently the majority of people voted in a referendum to leave the European Union - the so-called “Brexit”.  Viewing this example of direct democracy in action the EU naturally recognized the results of the vote as reflecting  “the will of the people”. Similarly, two years ago in Crimea a majority of people voted in a referendum to exit from Ukraine – a “Crimexit” if you will. However, the same EU did not recognize this particular referendum as reflecting “the will of the people” even though the vote was not even close.Currently, there are guardians of democracy in the UK and Europe who are calling for a second referendum to determine if the majority of people “really, really, actually want to do this Brexit thing”. According to their logic, a second referendum is needed to fully confirm that the true “will of the people” is clearly known – a “second opinion” as some are calling it.If one examines closely the parallels here, one sees that in actuality, that the Crimeans themselves have already voted twice for their “Crimexit” – the first being held in 1991. (At the time the government of Ukraine simply ignored the results of the vote).The problem is that the guardians of democracy in the UK and Europe do not recognize the results of two referenda in Crimea thereby contradicting their own logic and reasoning with regard to “true democracy” being dependent on two votes.So illogical…Is it any wonder that intelligent beings in the Cosmos are so far away from us?This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

The US and the European Union both intervened in the process, urging Britons to vote against leaving the EU, and then went on to claim this exact behavior of Russia. This is in spite of the fact that Russia kept sedulously out of it all and left the matter to Britons.President Putin here patiently explains all this, without reference to the aforementioned psychological theories; but one can see how these theories may be applicable to the case in question.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Despite this, Johnson appears more than willing to accept the anti-Russia story as “clear.”The question is how Vladimir Putin managed to hack the earlier pro-Brexit Boris Johnson's mouth.

It appears that the European Union is aiming to become the EU superstate envisaged by Karl Marx more than a hundreds years ago, with an EU army, police force, with fiscal, immigration, work and taxation rules forcefully applied to any EU member states, which will be simply transformed into being mere regions run by a tiny number of grossly overpaid unelected EU Commissars who will never be held accountable for their mistakes, mismanagement and even theft!3.

For example: “I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe,” Trump told Fox News late on Thursday. “A lot of that was pushed by the EU. I would say that they’re better off without it, personally, but I’m not making that as a recommendation. Just my feeling.”The European Union is a cesspool of \"feelings\".

Nevertheless, it is precisely America which is disengaging from Europe, except for the region on the border with the Russian Federation, where the US Armed Forces (and not only the NATO ones) are converging, with an ad hoc military structure and a new network of sensors and missile sites, both fixed and mobile ones, between Poland and Romania up to the Turkish border.As is the case with its scarcely imaginatively currency, the European Union proposes itself as a \"bridge\" for resolving tensions between the Middle East, North Africa and the Persian Gulf, but with no weapons and no credible economic leverage, without stable allies and with a policy still oriented to the old peacekeeping concept.Hence if Brexit succeeds, Prime Minister David Cameron - heir to Premier Margaret Thatcher who, at first, made Great Britain adhere to the EU in 1973 and later coldly managed the British presence within the organization - will have no interest in implementing or even discussing the new EU global strategy.If Brexit fails, however, it would be mostly the same.Prime Minister Cameron will either come even closer to US interests, or he will play with his own forces among the various regional powers in the above mentioned areas.Even if Bremain were successful, the British authorities would have no interest in pressing ahead with the new European Global Strategy.The fact is that there is an old system which is changing and shrinking, namely the Euro-Atlantic system, and a new system being built, namely Eurasia led by Russia and China, which will reach up to the Mediterranean with its Belt and Road Initiative and the integration of its economies into the vast Asian world, which is recording an economic and strategic expansion fully promoted by China.The EU has not chosen yet and it has not dealt these issues with the respective poles of attraction. It still has a vision that Marx would call \"economicist\" and believes that a powerless GDP, deprived of strategic perspectives, is enough to stay afloat in the future multipolar world.In the event of a soft Brexit, Great Britain may collaborate with the European Union's core countries to a common security policy, but it is extremely unlikely for the EU to implement its global foreign policy without the support of a military, diplomatic and intelligence power such as Great Britain.The possibility of counter-terrorism cooperation with the rest of Europe at collective security level would remain open, but certainly the project of a Joint European Army - as called for by many circles - would fade away.Many weaknesses do not create a force, and it is not clear what the \"external objectives\" and the unified strategy of the new Joint European Army could be.Without any reference to Brexit, Great Britain has planned to invest 178 billion pounds over a ten-year period, as stated in the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2015.Great Britain wants to become a \"pocket superpower\" on its own, as quickly as possible.Rather than at a Common European Security and Defense Policy, it has never liked, Great Britain is still aiming at the wide NATO context and at enhanced bilateral cooperation with the EU Member States within it.France is certainly a candidate for stable collaboration with Great Britain, but France officially theorizes the participation of the German Armed Forces and this is not wished at all by Great Britain.Great Britain seems to be still living at the time of Lord Kitchener’s policy: it wants a united Europe as a way to be spared East and South (trade, migration and financial) invasions, but it does not think of a strongly united EU, which would inevitably become German-led.But what is the current EU influence on the NATO framework? It is far from negligible.Since 2003 there has been a significant contribution of European countries’ troops to the Atlantic Alliance’s mechanism of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), a brigade designed to move very quickly towards NATO's Eastern borders.It is subject to the rule of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.Europe is present in the VJTF primarily for its economic commitments in Ukraine, following the signing of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the country.The DCFTA between the EU and Ukraine envisages, first of all, the removal of all import and export taxes.Also at agricultural level there are duty free products: cereals, pork and beef, poultry and horticulture.Also the trade of manufactured goods has been liberalized, especially for the companies operating in the textiles and machine tools sectors.Obviously the core of the issue is that a sharp reduction of duties is envisaged also for the petroleum products.Hence, while the EU overall strategy is moving along the lines of defining various individual strategies for each point of crisis (Sahel, Libya, the Horn of Africa, etc.), Great Britain may certainly participate in the NATO framework of these operations, but it has no interest in taking part in it as a EU member.Great Britain will never be - nor could it be otherwise - a sort of Australia or New Zealand at military and strategic levels.It will never be a power \"on call\", as some domestic workers.Britain has the potential, ideas and weapons to become - by itself - the power broker in all the regions in which it is directly interested: the North Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Greater Middle East.Since its membership of the EU in 1973, Great Britain has always considered its diplomatic policy in the European Union as a subset of its broader foreign policy action.Since the time of Prime Minister Churchill onwards, Europe has been one of the components of the British presence in the world.It has been its \"second circle\", but never the first, which is the special relationship with its old rebellious colonies, namely the United States.This is even the sense in which we have to interpret Sir Winston Churchill’s remark \"We butchered the wrong pig\", when – in the aftermath of World War II - he developed the very secret plan Operation Unthinkable, which assumed the British invasion of the USSR to destroy Bolshevism in the phase of its greatest weakness.The UK overall strategy vis-à-vis the EU has always been the stabilization of the Union as a largely deregulated free trade area, as well as its rapid expansion and the often clear and sharp refusal of any attempt to turn the European Union into a political entity, or even worse, into the \"United States of Europe\".Obviously Great Britain has always tended to equate its solitary role in Europe with the Franco-German duo as EU leaders and it has always tried to outline the EU strategic lines together or, sometimes, against the French-German axis.Hence Great Britain has always been particularly interested in the Common European Foreign and Security Policy, in the Common Security and Defense Policy and in all EU external relations, often established by its individual Member States through the EU channels.Hence the British primary interest for the EU External Action Service.And it is only on the basis of the 32 different documents drafted by the British government during the 2010-2015 Review of the Balance of Competences that we can analyze the costs and benefits of Brexit or Bremain.In terms of foreign policy, there is a British strong interest in operating through the European channels – for its own purposes.Furthermore Great Britain has been reluctant even to accept the rules of the European Fiscal Stability Treaty of December 2011.Since then the British media and governments have been supporting both the EU and the Commonwealth as the pillars of a new British foreign and security policy not confined only to the pro-European framework.Even the visits that Prime Minister Cameron paid abroad at the beginning of his first term were designed to convey two messages: Great Britain does not live only within the European Union, which is not the only focus and horizon of its foreign policy; Great Britain is more suitable than other geopolitical areas for keeping pace with the times - namely the Asian expansion, the new poles of development in Latin America and the significant growth of the Russian Federation.Hence a new National Security Council has been established, which regularly drafts the National Security Strategy (NSS).Every five years, also the Strategic Defense and Security Strategy (SDSS) is drawn up.The 2010 NSS and SDSS recommended a \"decentralized approach\" to the EU, as was also the case with the 2015 Strategies.In both documents the position maintained is that of a minor EU role in supporting the British choices.In any case the role played by Great Britain within the EU will remain stable both in case of Brexit and in case of Bremain and also the international challenges that Great Britain has decided to face in the coming years will remain the same.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e86cd6dba1b08b5a8b21c"},"url":"https://russia-insider.com/en/politics/russian-embassy-slams-uk-attempts-drag-russia-brexit-campaign/ri13320","content":"The Russian embassy has issued statement criticising attempts by the British government and pro-EU campaigners to win the coming referendum by saying Russia wants BrexitThe Russian Embassy in London has been finally goaded into action by the constant attempts to drag Russia into Britain's EU referendum debate.It is becoming a constant trope of the pro-EU camp that Russia wants Britain to quit the EU.The claim is brought up in article after article and speech after speech, often with the claim Russia is the “only” country that wants Britain to quit the EU.The claim is rubbish.  It's all mind-reading.No Russian official - certainly not Putin - has ever said anything like that.  In fact they've never said anything about the referendum or Brexit at all.Some Russian commentators and journalists have talked about it - as they have a perfect right to do - but this should in no sense be taken to mean the Russian government has any opinion about it.Though I don't like to guess Putin’s private opinions on any question, my best guess is he barely thinks about it and doesn't care.At the end of the day, whether Britain stays or leaves, Putin still has to deal with the two Western countries that for Russia really matter: the US and Germany.  Britain quitting the EU changes nothing.Besides Putin knows there's nothing he can do to influence the EU referendum.   He's far too practical a man to waste time on something he can't do anything aboutThough it may be too difficult a truth for the British to accept, their disastrous mishandling of their relations with Russia and Britain’s fallen place in the world mean that for the Russians Britain just doesn't matter.The Russian Embassy in London under the dynamic leadership of Ambassador Yakovenko has now pointed all this out.  See its statement below.Unfortunately the British people won't be told about this Statement.  Their government and media won't tell them.The pro-EU camp will go on making exactly the same bogus claims about Russia they have been making up to now.  Putin wanting Britain to quit the EU is just too good a story for them to give up on it, and the British government and media nowadays never let the facts get in the way of a good story.That is not however a reason for not putting the record straight, and the Russian Embassy has done its job by doing so.This is a Statement of the Russian Embassy to the UK first published on its websiteFor quite a while the British Government has been referring to perceived Russia/the Kremlin’s interest when facing a problem of selling its policies to the public opinion at home, otherwise suspect and unconvincing. It is done at various levels of the Government including Foreign and Defense Secretaries. What all the pronouncements of this sort have in common is the claim to know better than the Russian Government where our national interest lies and what our policies are. In a sense Russia is scapegoated for almost everything that has gone wrong in Britain and the West over the past 25 years, i.e. the War in Iraq, misadventure in Libya, global financial crisis, advent of deglobalisation (the term, coined by Gordon Brown), the Ukrainian and Syrian crises, and now the rise of anti-establishment sentiment in the West and the migration crisis of the EU.That behaviour has reached a new high now that Russia is being dragged into the domestic debate on Brexit. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, speaking at the Chatham House on 2 March said, that “the only country who would like us to leave the EU is Russia.” And that, according to him, “should tell us all we need to know.” First of all, why is the wicked Russia thesis used to explain a Government policy, be it the presumed deal struck with the EU partners or a more fundamental issue of the EU membership, which must be defended on its merits? Secondly, why is it all the British public need to know?And why shift the topic? The EU is not a military alliance, which is Nato. It is not about the special relationship with the US. Neither is the British nuclear deterrent involved, not is, for that matter, London’s permanent seat at the UN Security Council at stake.It goes without saying that we have a huge problem with this strategy/tactics. It seems that the present British Government has a vested interest in a disfunctional bilateral relationship with Russia. Another conclusion one may draw therefrom is that the authorities thus admit that they cannot win the argument in an open and straightforward debate. Of course, we wouldn’t oblige. We find this unfair towards both Russia, with whom Britain maintains diplomatic relations, and the British people, who deserve a better treatment from their own government.We expect our British partners to explain themselves. In the meantime, we’d like the British people to know that those pronouncements have nothing to do with Russia’s policy. As a matter of fact, our Government doesn’t have an opinion on Britain’s place in the EU. We have nothing to do with the very idea to hold this referendum. It is for the British to decide. We’ll accept any outcome. We have enough problems of our own to mind somebody else’s business. More than that, we believe that if our Western partners had minded their own business well enough, all of us would have had fewer international problems on our hands.It doesn’t mean that we don’t have problems dealing with the EU. Overall, we share the concern over the bias in the form of political expediency/correctness that stifles debate on real issue, forces real life into the straitjacket of ideological constructs and schemes. In reality, these leads to crises like the EU unilateralist foray, under the previous Brussels team, into the Ukrainian affairs.We are even blamed for the migration crisis in Europe. And that contrary to the fact that it started well before our limited military intervention in Syria on 30 September 2015, which radically changed the dynamics in that country, helped establish the IGSS and bring hope of peace. Was it not the West, who by way of Libyan intervention as a precedent misled the Syrians on both sides and then outsourced the regime change to its regional allies, who have their own accounts to settle, have designs on Syrian territory and still insist that Syria become a Sunni state? Russia, on the contrary, is hugely contributing to finding a political solution in Syria and, thus, alleviating the migration crisis. This is done at least at four levels: fighting Isis (our limited Air Force deployment), working in tandem with the US in the IGSS, mediating support for the ceasefire at the grass-root level on the ground and providing humanitarian aid. We’d like to know what the British record on Syria is?We wouldn’t have dwelt on that, had HMG not alluded to the Russian threat to British national security at every opportunity. We leave it to the conscience of our British partners. As to the Brexit debate, we find any outside interference unacceptable and counterproductive for the cause of the Government, especially given the fact that the issue is viewed by many in Britain in existential terms.This statement is circulated to both referendum campaigns, to all the main political parties and British media. This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Unilever on 15 March 2018 said they have decided to move its corporate headquarters from Britain to Netherlands. EPA-EFE/HANNAH MCKAYTheresa May is proposing a hard Brexit for services and a soft Brexit for goods.The White Paper commitmentThe British government published on Thursday a so-called “White Paper,” that is, a consolidated negotiating position on how London envisions its relationship with the 500-strong Single Market after it leaves the EU.Critics have long said that London has been negotiating with itself, as Theresa May has been struggling to form a single position on Brexit that brings onboard hardline leave campaigners and those seeking to maintain the status quo in economic ties the UK harnessed over the last 45 years of EU membership.The vision put forward last Friday is now formalized. Seen and treated as a mere formality, the new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab presented the paper in parliament without distributing a copy of the policy to MPs in advance.It’s there in black and whiteFor those that did read the paper – in advance or after its formal release – it presented few surprises.  The main idea is a soft Brexit in goods and a hard Brexit in services.The UK government proposes a common regulatory framework and a customs’ “combined area,” although a big conceptual gap remains as to how VAT tax collection will be organized.The proposal also envisages the UK maintaining some sort of Associate membership in key regulatory agencies that set standards in the chemicals, aviation and medicines. The issue is whether this will be possible without a common normative foundation.In this scheme, Theresa May hopes for a practical and business-friendly Brexit that will not trigger the loss of blue-collar jobs. Over the last two weeks industrial behemoths such as Airbus, Nissan, Land Rover, BMW, Siemens had been warning that the breaking up of pan-European value chains was pushing them out of the UK.Equally significant is that this plan seems to receiving a nod in Dublin, which means the UK is closer to retaining open borders – and peace – in Northern Ireland.On services, the main scenario is a hard Brexit based on the concept of “equivalence,” which provides unreliable access to the Single Market based on mutual recognition of standards that can be revoked. For over a year, major lenders, consulting groups and insurers have been setting up officers in a series of cities across Europe to retain so-called “passporting rights.”As regard to the “freedom of movement,” the UK aspires to freedom of movement for tourists, controlling migration for business purposes.The red line on the European Court of Justice jurisdiction has been somewhat blurred, as UK tribunals will consult EU case law. However, London insists on international arbitration rather than ECJ jurisdiction.Half-Empty versus Half-full reactionsNo stakeholder is entirely satisfied with the White Paper: some MPs and the service sector express dismay; hardline Brexiteers express outrage; EU leaders reserve the right to express their opinion after they have properly considered the proposal. Meanwhile, Theresa May is back on thin ice.Following the resignation of the Brexit chief negotiator David Davis and the foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Monday, hardline backbenchers are now taking the lead in calling into question the legitimacy of May’s compromise.The influential Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Thursday that the paper sets out a “bad deal for Britain.” Taking a step further, Rees-Mogg will try to amend government legislation next week, so as to ensure that Northern Ireland cannot have a separate trade regime than the rest of the UK.The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the plan means the UK will “half leave” the EU.May reiterated that the plan delivers on the promise to “take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.”Opposition MPs called for a closer union with the EU, with Labour drawing close to a Norway type deal, while some campaign for a second referendum.Brussels appears to be responding positively. Both Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt welcomed the UK’s proposal. However, neither of them commented on policy detail.In any event, the White Paper has been reportedly been drafted with the consultation of EU leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel. Chancellor Merkel has made no comment on the subject.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"May proposes a soft Brexit on goods and a hard Brexit on services","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:11:51.360Z"},"time":"Jul 13, 2018"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e88836dba1b08b5a8baa4"},"url":"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/brexit-threat-british-security/","content":"Some moments in history are steeped in irony. To glimpse a current example, look no further than the United Kingdom. As the Brexit negotiations with the European Union approach a tipping point – this month’s European Council meeting – the British government is seeking its scorned European partners’ help in its dispute with Russia over the attempted murder of the former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England.But even before the brazen attack on the Skripals – targeted with the Soviet-designed nerve agent Novichok – Prime Minister Theresa May had become more forthright in highlighting the values and interests shared by the UK and the EU, including with regard to security and defense. Indeed, at last month’s Munich Security Conference, she proposed a “deep and special partnership” on such matters.In May’s preferred scenario, the UK would continue to participate fully in EU agencies like EUROPOL, while upholding European Arrest Warrants (EAWs). Moreover, the UK would maintain its involvement in existing and future EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) missions, and coordinate with the EU on sanction regimes under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).The attack on the Skripals has surely reinforced May’s interest in ensuring strong security cooperation after Brexit. The kind of external threat that the attack represented is best addressed in cooperation with allies. But can the UK’s allies take May seriously?Those “who threaten our security,” she said in Munich, “would like nothing more than to see us fractured…and to see us put debates about mechanisms and means ahead of doing what is most practical and effective in keeping our people safe.” Then, after reiterating that the UK had made a legitimate and democratic decision to leave the EU, she concluded that the ball is the EU’s court. Not to accept her generous offer of close security cooperation would, in her words, amount to putting “political doctrine and ideology” first.The irony of May’s stance has not been lost on the 27 EU states that the UK is leaving behind. After all, by casting doubt on the unity of Europe – and, indeed, the entire West – Brexit itself is causing serious damage to European security, all for the sake of political doctrine and ideology.To be sure, hardline Brexiteers like Trade Minister Liam Fox claim that the only external relationship the UK needs to buttress its security is NATO, led by the United States. Yet while NATO will obviously remain the paramount source of security for all of Europe, no one should be willing to entrust their security to US President Donald Trump, who seems to have more contempt for allies than for adversaries like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. As the intelligence chiefs of Britain, France, and Germany warned in a little-noticed joint statement released in Munich, any breakdown in security cooperation between the UK and the EU will have dire consequences.But May cannot expect to maintain the UK’s current level of security cooperation with the EU, especially in the context of the otherwise “hard” Brexit she envisages. When the UK departs from the EU, it will lose its right to shape the institutional frameworks that have long buttressed its security. This leaves May with two choices: either she can leave those frameworks behind – a highly risky move – or she can accept, at least for the most part, the EU’s terms.For example, the legal framework for security-related data must also cover commercial data. If the UK can tolerate giving jurisdiction in this area to a European high court, as May’s Munich speech seems to suggest, why not in other areas? The European Court of Justice has an impeccable reputation as an independent judicial body – one that has fairly defended the UK’s own interests many times.Such an approach would generate significant goodwill in the negotiations. This, together with the UK’s considerable security-related assets and expertise, would create space for the country to carve out unique concessions from the EU, such as full-time observer status in the EU’s influential Political and Security Committee.Whether or not such forms of cooperation – essential to ensuring security in both the UK and the EU – are realized, however, is far from certain. Though May now seems to hold a more realistic view of the security risks Brexit poses, others in her party remain obstinate.For example, Owen Paterson, a former Conservative cabinet minister, recently suggested doing away with the Good Friday Agreement, which has delivered two decades of peace to Northern Ireland – a highly reckless statement, given the political sensitivities that the Brexit vote triggered in Ireland. Other Brexiteers, like Environment Minister Michael Gove, are also long-time skeptics of the Good Friday accords. This suggests that, in the eyes of Brexit ideologues, security must take a back seat to their nationalist dreams.Perhaps the recent attack on a former Russian agent in a quiet English country town will be enough to remove the ideological blinders from more Brexiteers, showing them that a “Britain alone” is a “Britain vulnerable.” But it is also possible that by the time the UK’s citizens and leaders see Brexit from their allies’ perspective – as a selfish and destructive act of betrayal – it will be too late.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2018. www.project-syndicate.org\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"The Brexit Threat to British Security","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:12:18.099Z"},"time":"Mar 26, 2018"}

Salvini is the leader of Lega, a partner in the new incoming Italian government, and a Member of the European Parliament which is a good enough excuse to talk to him unofficially, of course.The sudden wave of warnings shows the level of panic in the Commission when it began to realise what the immediate future would look like.Anti-establishment parties won the election in Italy, if only marginally, which means that if it will not be politically possible to produce a government for the time being there will be new snap elections shortly, with a landslide victory by Lega and their 5-Star Movement (M5S) anti-establishment counterparts.In such an election, M5S cannot expect to increase in their share of seats in the Italian Parliament. Lega, however, which is in the eyes of Italians as a part of the traditional political parties and is currently riding a wave of victorious momentum, will get votes from the losers of the same family – former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and Partito Democratico, which was led by ex-PM Matteo Renzi until their resounding defeat in the March election.Brussels must, therefore, understand that from now on it does not have to negotiate with Renzi or Paolo Gentiloni, another former prime minister from Italy’s recent past, but with Salvini and Di Maio.The three warnings by the Commission were an inappropriate signal because give ground to both M5S and Lega to focus the next electoral campaign on a possible referendum for Itexit – an Italian exit from the European Union. And this case is in no way similar to that of the United Kingdom as Italy is in the Eurozone and a founding Member State of the EU.The real problem of the European Union during this wave of anti-establishment sentiments is confined solely to the UK or Italy. The problem is that because of the extended austerity programmes, over-regulation, and immigration, heterodox insurgent forces became the new political trend in Europe. If it is not tackled now, at the early embryonic stage, it may well take on the dimension of a catastrophic avalanche in the not-so-distant future.This is what the European Commission must handle as the alternative to dismemberment.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"From Brexit to Itexit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:12:45.990Z"},"time":"May 16, 2018"}

EPA-EFE/OLIVIER HOSLETThe pound continues to slide as markets see the possibility of a hard Brexit is nearing closer; the warnings are coming from the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the British government. On Thursday, the European Commission issued a warning to member states to prepare for “all outcomes” as regards to Brexit, as a hard Brexit will hurt supply logistics, transport and trade. A number of sectors have started moving personnel, including insurance and banking.The IMF warned on Wednesday of a rising possibility of a crush out; this warning was echoed by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who warned the EU to brace for a no-deal Brexit. In the words of the Irish Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar, the main political issue is that the UK government does not have a parliamentary or even cabinet majority for any solution.The next landmark date on the calendar is the EU Council in October, six months before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.The IMF is warning this could cost EU economies a collective 1,5% in growth by 2030 if the UK falls back on World Trade Organisation trade rules. The hit would be hardest for Ireland, followed by the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Malta, Cyprus, and Luxembourg.For the UK, there seems to be a more short-term effect as the pound is eroding purchasing power.In the short run, the UK could expect growth decelerating by 2% of its GDP.The prospect of hard Brexit is already causing damage. Currently, inflation in the UK remains subdued despite expectations and a surge in energy prices. The prospect of an interest hike in July is now called into question. Core inflation remains below 2%, even if the UK recorded record low unemployment on Wednesday.IMF projections have not been accurate in the past, as the economy avoided recession in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 EU membership referendum.Customs are preparing for thousands of trucks being held at the border daily.The Netherlands and France are hiring added Customs personnel to respond to a potential crisis. The UK government is considering converting a stretch of the M20 Motorway in Kent into a vast parking; it is also hiring personnel and equipment. Up to 5,000 additional customs officers could be needed.Industry can only stockpile parts of planes and cars to prepare for the worst-case scenario, before production units shift altogether.

Hamburg is one of the biggest Airbus plants with about 12,500 employeesAirbus issued its strongest warning yet over the impact of Britain’s departure from the European Union, saying that a withdrawal without a deal on future trade would force it to reconsider its long-term position in the UK.Airbus has confirmed it is considering cutting thousands of jobs in the UK as it starts to “press the button on crisis actions” over concerns about Brexit.In a memorandum, Airbus said softer plans for a transition period ending in December 2020 were still too short for the planemaker to adapt its supply chain and would prevent it from expanding its UK supplier base.Airbus, which makes wings for all its passenger jets in the UK, said that leaving both the EU’s single market and customs union immediately and without any agreed transition would lead to “severe disruption and interruption” of UK production.Airbus, which directly employs 14,000 people at 25 sites in Britain and supports more than 100,000 jobs in the wider supply chain, also said a no-deal scenario would lead to “catastrophic” consequences , which could cost the company billions of pounds in delays. The firm also said it was considering stockpiling billions of pounds of parts to prepare for Brexit disruption.Echoing calls from Germany’s Siemens earlier this week, Airbus said it needed immediate details on how its operations would need to be organized.Industry analysts say Airbus would be unlikely to pull out of the UK abruptly because of long lead times and waiting lists for its planes. But it could consider shifting wings for the next generation of single-aisle jets, whose development is expected to begin around the middle of next decade.Germany, Spain or emerging aerospace suppliers such as South Korea are seen as possible candidates to take work from the UK.British Prime Minister Theresa May won a crucial Brexit vote in parliament on Wednesday, keeping her divided government’s plans to end more than 40 years of British partnership with the European Union on track.Talks with the bloc have all but stalled, however, with May’s top team of ministers at odds over plans for future trading relations with the EU.

In a similar poll April last year, only 31% of people supported a second referendum.Over the past couple of months, the idea of a vote on the terms of the deal with the option of remaining in the EU has been gaining momentum. Several politicians have come out and given their opinion on a second referendum.Euronews asked MPs from the 'remain' and 'leave' camp what they think.Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and WallingtonOn whether there should be a referendum on the final Brexit deal:\"Yes, there should definitely be a final say on the deal or a vote on the deal. We are not calling it a second referendum because that implies that it’s just a rerun of the first one. This is not a re-run of the first referendum. This is a referendum on the deal that the UK government will have reached with the European Union or possibly no-deal if that’s what they arrive at.\"What we want, and I think that this is what the people want as well, is that the people be given a chance to either vote for the deal the government reaches — and I hope they do reach one — or staying in the EU.\"What should the referendum look like?\"It should be a two-part question, which is either people can vote for the deal the government has reached or they can vote to stay in the European Union.\"Sir David Amess, Conservative MP for Southend WestOn whether there should be a referendum on the final Brexit deal:\"I have been an MP for 35 years and never thought that we would be given the chance to vote again on our membership of the EU. I was absolutely delighted and surprised by the result, I had voted 'no' in the first referendum. There will not be a second referendum or a people's vote, the whole proposition is absolutely ridiculous and it is not going to happen. We will have left the EU by the end of March next year and I welcome the fact. It is now in everyone’s interest to make sensible arrangements for Britain’s departure. I have no doubt at all that future generations of Britons will be very pleased that we have left the EU.\"\"I only ever wanted us to trade our goods and services, have strong educational and cultural links and work together on security and defence matters but I have always been opposed to a United States of Europe with one government, one currency, one foreign policy and one defence policy, not least because we are a proud trading nation who are hardly prepared to be subservient to other nations.\"For a second referendum to take place before the deadline in March 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May's agreement with the EU would have to be rejected by UK Parliament. In that case, a referendum is a possible solution to the political deadlock that would ensue.Read More | How the UK's Brexit process works in one chartHowever, a referendum needs an Act of Parliament, which needs to obtain a majority of MPs' votes and, even if it got a majority of the votes, the legislative process to establish one can be lengthy. It took seven months before Parliament signed off on the Brexit referendum's legislation in 2015.

However, they have turned one of Theresa May’s slogans into a mantra: “no deal is better than a bad deal”.They argue that by standing firm, Brussels will bend. Although EU insiders point out that defending its principles – protecting the single market and ruling out “cherry-picking” from EU rules, for instance – are a matter of survival for the bloc.For Brexiteers however, freedom from EU ties paves the way for a bright future for “Global Britain”. In contrast, sticking close to EU rules and regulations would not be a true Brexit and therefore would undermine the results of the people's vote.Above all, they say the UK could thrive even if no accord is struck by the time of the UK’s departure from the EU in March 2019.  Their arguments have been put into sharp focus by the high-profile resignations from the government of two of their champions: the ex-Brexit minister David Davis, and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.  The prime minister and her government have often defined Brexit as being about “taking back control”: after it leaves the EU, Britain will control its own borders, laws, and money.Theresa May has long said that the UK may choose to stay close to EU rules and standards – but sovereignty, decision-making and judicial oversight will come back across the Channel from the continent.However, her red lines have become increasingly blurred as compromises have been made over financial contributions to the EU, immigration, jurisdiction and more.Recently May has been widely seen as increasingly steering the country towards a softer Brexit, out of tune with her earlier robust statements. Her latest plan unveiled to ministers at Chequers as the blueprint for proposals to be put to the EU, has brought fears that it will not mean Brexit but BRINO – “Brexit In Name Only”.Brexiteers argue that the UK needs to stop being tied to the EU’s apron strings, in order to have the freedom to do trade deals around the world.They say there are massive opportunities to trade internationally. Britain’s future lies in developing markets outside the European Union, with places like Asia representing an ever-increasing slice of world growth. In contrast, some say, Europe is in decline.Adhering to “regulatory alignment” with EU rules and regulations in order to keep trading smoothly means the UK will become a “rule-taker” outside the bloc with no say.Not only that, they argue that striking trade deals outside the EU would become harder to do – as freedom to meet other countries’ demands would be restricted.They are looking for an accord with Brussels that has been described as “SuperCanada” or “Canada+++”, a free trade agreement based on Canada’s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) – arguing that such a prize has even been offered by European Council President Donald Tusk.Under a “no-deal scenario”, the UK would conduct its trade under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.This is widely interpreted as meaning higher tariffs, but Brexiteers dispute this. They argue that Britain could lead the way in cutting tariffs to zero to ensure seamless free trade.“We don’t want any tariffs anywhere, and under those conditions a newly independent UK, outside the customs union, outside the single market, outside the ECJ (European Court of Justice)… will have access to the world,” former UK government minister Owen Paterson told BBC Radio. “Our current European suppliers, who we value a lot, will have to compete on world terms. That will bring prices down for every business and every single family.”Tariffs are not the only barrier to trade. Businesses also point out that EU rules mean no border checks, enabling complex supply chains to operate smoothly, delivering components “just-in-time”.Brexiteers advocate a maximum facilitation or “MaxFac” proposal for life outside the customs union. An existing “trusted trader” scheme could be extended. Customs checks could be carried out via electronic surveillance, including vehicle number plate recognition technology.They detest an alternative “Customs Partnership” scheme – May’s latest plan is seen as a variation of it – arguing it’s likely to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, tie the UK to product regulations, and preclude future trade deals.Brussels doesn’t like either proposal, leading to much anticipation over how it will respond to May’s “third way” plan.The UK and the EU are committed to maintaining an open border between a future Northern Ireland outside the bloc, and the Republic of Ireland which is an EU member.Avoiding a hard border has been seen as trying to square a circle, virtually impossible if the UK leaves the customs union and single market.Some Brexiteers argue that the danger of a hard border is overstated, and does not threaten the Good Friday Agreement that ended 30 years of sectarian strife.An open border with no physical infrastructure is still possible, they say. Dublin and Belfast already diverge on many matters including tax and excise duties, unproblematic for peace and stability.Immigration can still be controlled, and anyway the Common Travel Area enabled free movement across the border for 50 years before EU membership.For goods, customs controls will indeed be needed after Brexit but that doesn’t need to involve border checks or infrastructure. On standards, the fact products start from a position of regulatory alignment will help.A common Brexiteer assertion is that Brussels, Dublin and Remainers play up the “intractable” Irish border problem as a matter of political expediency.Brexiteers want Theresa May to stick to her pledge that “our laws… will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across this country”. The government has vowed that jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) will end “on the day the UK leaves the EU”.However, the UK has conceded that the ECJ will continue to have influence on British court decisions. Under the agreement over a transition period until the end of 2020, it will continue to have jurisdiction.Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of the Conservative European Research Group, are alarmed that the government’s latest plans “may even leave some sort of backdoor role” for the European court. “This would be a deeply unsatisfactory non-Brexit,” he told the BBC.“The European Court of Justice should be recognised in the same way as the Supreme Court of the United States is recognised. It has authority over its own territory, and over what goes on within its territory and with agencies that are covered by it. It ought to have no writ within the United Kingdom,” he argued.On trade, he says the ECJ naturally has jurisdiction in the European Union – but not over goods that enter, are sold or made in the UK, unless they are exported to the EU.Brexiteers are often staunchly adamant that a good deal is there to be done with the EU. They reject as “totally wrong” claims that ministers have no chance of striking a “bespoke” agreement, Theresa May’s stated intention.The EU is accused of trying to intimidate the UK into accepting a bad deal, for fear of having none. The government should call Brussels’ bluff and make it clear that Britain is not scared of – and has prepared for – the infamous “no-deal”.Many, like Howard Flight – a Conservative member of the House of Lords – argue that Britain can strengthen its hand by threatening to withhold its financial settlement if there is no guarantee of a trade agreement.If Brussels refuses to bend, the UK should walk out of the talks, he wrote in BrexitCentral, the pro-Brexit website.“Now is the time to take the lead; to reaffirm what deal is acceptable to us, and if refused, to exit negotiating and rely on the WTO. The reality is that our position is stronger than that of the EU.”","header":"The case for a hard Brexit: why it might not be all doom and gloom","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:14:35.675Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  06/07/2018\n"}

The minister of health also said that his department was working on plans to stockpile essential medicines, devices, and, ominously, “substances of human origin”. The UK government’s own economic projections predict appalling economic harm from a chaotic No Deal Brexit, with over two million jobs lost, and the poorest regions hit hardest. Over a million UK citizens in the EU would cease to have a legal status overnight. Government policy however remains that “No Deal is better than a bad deal”. It should be obvious to all now though that it isn’t.There’s a very simple way for the UK government to avoid the utterly dreadful and demeaning effects and equally indignified and costly contingency plans for a No Deal Brexit. The UK government can take it off the table. Exclude it as a possibility, or at least as an option, right now.No deal is not just one of several options for Brexit. It is a total false equivalence to put it, as many do, on an equal footing with a free trade agreement, an EEA+ type agreement, or with remaining in the EU. It’s possible to have a conversation about the pros and cons of each of those. I believe that remaining in the EU would be by far the best option, but I’m happy to admit that the others might at least be possible without having to resort to stockpiling medicines, blood and food.The prime minister believes that threatening no deal is a show of strength, but it is the UK population that is being threatened here, not the EU27. It is not a show of strength. It is a show of weakness, irresponsibility, and, ultimately, failure. A policy that admits No Deal as a live option for the UK represents not just a failure in negotiations, but a failure as a government and as a parliament. It is central to the role of both to avoid a crisis such as this ever occurring, particularly when it would be entirely of their own making.There is no mandate whatsoever for a No Deal Brexit. All discussion on both sides prior to the 2016 referendum was predicated on the basis that there would at least be an orderly, agreed exit, even if there was not a quick agreement on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The push for No Deal (and it is a deliberate push from some) came only late, as an ill-conceived attempt to gain leverage, or at least the approval of the right wing press, from a government realising that it had very little elsewhere.It was never a credible threat, and has never achieved a shred of additional leverage. Having put a menu of options on the table and asked the UK to choose which it prefers, the UK has chosen instead baskets of hand-picked cherries, endless cake and a big portion of burned trust. The EU27 now finds itself in the position of having to prepare itself for No Deal. That it is doing that through careful analysis and planning rather than concessions that would undermine the Single Market shows how little leverage the threat has created.There are very few British MPs actually pushing for this. The 40 or 50 MPs in the hard-right Brexit Ultra European Research Group, and less than a handful of ministers, should not and cannot be all out to drive a country to the brink of disaster like this. Parliament should refuse to consider No Deal as an option, either in votes it holds, or in the referendum on the withdrawal agreement that many in the UK are now calling for. It should not be considered, anymore than the amputation of a leg should be considered to treat a cold.It is the UK government’s responsibility to announce now that it would take every step possible to avoid what would now obviously be a catastrophe for the UK. These can include requesting an extension to Article 50, possible to call a referendum on the deal or a general election, or requesting a suspension or even revocation of Article 50. No amount of embarrassment, loss of face, or concessions in negotiations could be worse than the prospect of shortages of essentials and the civil unrest that could follow. Through either, lives could be ruined or lost.If the government will not take it off the table, MPs, the media and the UK population must. They must make it clear that, even as a possibility, it is unacceptable. The UK media has to stop covering this as just another story, and get over the seriousness of what’s at stake. MPs must show real honesty and fortitude.Extreme Brexiters will howl that this is appeasement. It isn’t. There’s nobody to appease. Negotiations are with the UK’s closest allies, friends, partners and neighbours. This is not an external threat, foisted onto the UK government against its will. The threat of no deal is an internal threat, caused by its own decisions and willingness to drag the country it governs over a cliff.This is not a question of Leave vs. Remain, hard vs. soft Brexit, or europhile vs. eurosceptic. It is responsibility vs. Irresponsibility; security vs. insecurity; public safety vs. harm to a population; a future vs. a disaster. It should be nixed now.In addition to repeated signals from the leaders of EU institutions and several Member States that the UK can decide to stop Brexit if it wishes, there are now signals that EU27 would be prepared to consider an extension to Article 50 for the UK to complete democratic processes. The Irish Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said Ireland would support a UK request for an extension. The Government should begin discussions on this immediately.The government can then do its job and negotiate an agreement and a framework for a future relationship. Parliament, and if needs be the people, can then decide whether they prefer that agreement, or its only real alternative, which is to stay a member of the EU. This is the only remotely responsible route for our political leaders to take. Anything else is irresponsible madness.Steve Bullock is a former negotiator for the UK in the EU, and has also worked in the European Commission and Whitehall.

Ongoing negotiations between the British government and the European Commission reach a crucial point at the end of June at an EU summit in Brussels.Arguments have raged: between London and Brussels, “Leavers” and “Remainers”. Economic orthodoxy has been pitted against increasingly important themes such as identity and culture. Key points have become lost in the war of words as the process drags on.To help cut through the fog, here are Euronews’ answers to 10 key questions (they may be updated regularly as events unfold):The UK voted by 52 to 48 percent to leave the European Union – an economic and political partnership of 28 countries – at a referendum in June 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 of the EU’s Lisbon Treaty in March 2017 to set in motion the formal two-year process towards Brexit. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU at the end of March 2019.The June summit has been billed as a deadline for the UK to produce answers on key unresolved questions, but there are fears this will slip until the autumn.By then both sides hope to reach a draft deal on future ties. This would then be put to the European Council’s 27 national leaders at a summit in October. At least 20 countries representing 65 percent of the EU’s population, as well as the European Parliament, must approve it.The UK Parliament must also approve a final deal. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s flagship Brexit legislation has been going through the House of Commons and the House of Lords.The largely pro-EU upper house has inflicted several defeats on the government, sending its plans back to the elected chamber. There, the government’s precarious situation has made it vulnerable to internal rebellions from rival camps with opposing visions of Brexit.Two years after the referendum, the UK is still wrestling with a fundamental question over Brexit. The extent to which it should seek to diverge from EU rules and standards, and risk sacrificing the benefits of close ties, has sparked a monumental political debate. Brussels has repeatedly accused the British government of lacking clarity over its aims.Brexiteers say it’s about taking back control of the UK’s laws, money and borders. At the same time, Theresa May has said she wants the UK and the EU to remain close partners.After taking office, the prime minister pledged to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the UK, to end “free movement” for EU citizens into the UK, and to stop Britain’s “vast contributions” to the EU budget. The UK intends to leave the EU’s single market – which involves accepting free movement – but wants the best possible access to it via a new free trade agreement with the EU.Britain also seeks freedom to strike free trade deals with non-EU countries – which means leaving the EU’s customs union, as this ties members in to EU policy in imposing common external tariffs.The European Union’s objective has been to preserve its own unity and the integrity of internal arrangements such as the single market and customs union. Leaders have consistently warned that these would be undermined if the UK is allowed to “cherry-pick” from the rules, or “have its cake and eat it” by benefitting from the advantages without accepting the obligations.At the outset, the European Commission – mandated by EU leaders to conduct negotiations – quickly established priority issues concerning the UK’s departure to be resolved before future relations could be considered. These were the UK’s financial dues, the rights of EU and UK citizens, and avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.As for future ties, the EU wants a free trade agreement – without offering the UK the same benefits as membership – and a level playing field via an alignment of rules and standards.EU leaders see Brexit as a damage-limitation exercise which balances the need to protect the economy and preserve good future relations, against the political imperative of ensuring the UK does not emerge better off from leaving the bloc.Deadlock on the initial separation issues was broken in December 2017. Agreement was reached in Brussels on the UK’s financial settlement, citizens’ rights, and on the principles over Irish border arrangements.An accord was then struck in March this year on a transition phase – May’s government prefers the term “implementation period” – to run from Brexit Day in March 2019 until December 31, 2020. Many existing arrangements will remain in place to allow time to prepare for, and determine, new rules. The UK will be able to negotiate new trade deals but they won’t come into force until 2021.On money, the UK has agreed to pay into the EU budget as now until the current round ends in 2020. It may incur in future new liabilities agreed before then. The British government estimates the settlement will cost €40-45 billion.Agreement to keep the Irish border open – with no physical infrastructure such as customs posts or cameras – was consolidated in March 2018 into a draft legal document. If all else fails, the UK will “maintain full alignment” with single market and customs union rules to guarantee no hard border.EU citizens in the UK and Britons living on the continent will retain current rights to live and work on each side of the Channel right through the transition period until the end of 2020.The record so far shows that London has made more concessions than Brussels. For instance, Theresa May has accepted that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) will continue to have influence in the UK, though it can no longer be the ultimate arbiter of the law.Details concerning the UK’s future trading ties with the EU go to the heart of the Brexit debate. The government is split – reflecting the ruling Conservative Party’s divisions – and weakened by its fragile position in Parliament.Future customs arrangements have become one of the main Brexit sticking points. Under the EU’s customs union, countries impose a common tariff on goods coming from outside – which then circulate freely across national borders within the union without duties or checks. They cannot set their own import taxes.Theresa May’s government is committed to leaving the customs union in order to pursue an independent trade policy and be able to strike deals with countries around the world.For Brexiteers who want a clean break from the EU’s system, the question has become a litmus test on whether the UK is really ‘out’ of the EU. Pro-Europeans argue that some kind of customs union with the EU is necessary to avoid major disruption to trade and supply chains, inflicting serious economic damage.The government wants trade with the EU to be as frictionless as possible but ministers have been unable to agree on a suitable customs model. They have been considering two possible options – a customs partnership and a “maximum facilitation” arrangement – but the EU has greeted both with outright scepticism.The House of Lords has proved to be a thorn in the government’s side, passing amendments to its Brexit bill which will have to be considered when it returns to the House of Commons. They insist on a customs union arrangement and continued membership of the European Economic Area) (EEA) – which includes full access to the European single market.This raises the question of whether the UK could adopt a so-called “Norway model” – the non-EU country is a member of the EEA – but the government is hostile as it would mean accepting the free movement of people.Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn also rejects EEA membership for the same reasons, however his Labour Party has continued to soften its stance on Brexit. It wants a new customs union and now calls for “full access” to the single market, outside of full membership.The politics concerning the various options are complicated, but the outcome will determine how smooth trade will be between the UK and the EU – as well as the nature of the Irish border.Leading Brexiteers such as Liam Fox and Boris Johnson argue that the UK surrenders its trade policy to Brussels if it remains in a customs union with the EU.They say that being outside the EU will enable Britain to exploit new opportunities, with the trade secretary highlighting services and digital industries.Johnson has argued that changing trade patterns make the EU less important for the UK. Figures show that the proportion of UK exports going to the EU has fallen over the past decade, although their value has risen.The foreign secretary has cited the attraction of countries such as South Korea, where UK exports have doubled in recent years. Part of that success is due to the EU’s trade agreement with Seoul. After Brexit the UK risks losing such deals, although supporters say terms could still be applied.The UK should be able to negotiate new trade deals more easily than the EU, they argue, because talks will no longer have to cater for more than two dozen countries’ special interests.Several countries have been mooted as possible candidates for free trade deals with the UK, including the United States, China, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It has been claimed, however, that some may seek significant concessions from the UK.The question of the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU is also relevant to one of the key goals agreed by both sides: avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland – part of the UK and in future outside the EU – and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state.During the 30-year “Troubles” of the late 20th century, the border was heavily fortified and a focal point for tension and violence. People and goods crossing it were stopped for customs and identity checks.The 1998 Good Friday peace agreement paved the way for an open border. Security measures disappeared and the EU’s single market and customs union removed the need for inspections. However, political tensions remain between Irish nationalists and Northern Ireland’s unionists – which it’s believed could be inflamed should a hard border return – although some hardline Brexiteers believe the Irish border issue has been overblown.With the UK intending to leave the single market and customs union after Brexit, the question of how to avoid border controls is unresolved. Brussels’ suggestion that Northern Ireland remain part of the EU’s customs territory has been rejected out of hand by Theresa May and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) – on whose support her government relies – as it risks creating another border between the North’s six counties and the rest of the UK.The British government’s preferred solution is for a new free-trade agreement and customs deal with the EU, avoiding the need for border checks. Failing that, it believes technology and “trusted trader” schemes can be implemented. Brussels is nonplussed.The prime minister’s latest proposal for a “backstop solution”, involving the UK matching EU tariffs temporarily, has prompted internal dissent in her Cabinet.The draft treaty drawn up in March highlights more unresolved issues: they include governance of the Brexit deal and how to resolve disputes, the extent of ECJ jurisdiction in the UK, nuclear material, intellectual property, and security and defence cooperation.The UK’s future access to Galileo, the EU’s satellite project, is uncertain. There is uncertainty over cooperation in scientific research. Brexit poses challenges for the UK over tax policy, particularly VAT.Despite broad agreement on citizens’ rights, campaigners argue there is confusion surrounding the UK’s plans to give EU nationals “settled status” and there are fears that administrative problems may cause injustice.The question also remains over whether UK nationals will have the right to retain EU citizenship after Brexit, giving them the right to travel, live, study and work throughout the bloc. A court case is pending before the ECJ.There have been repeated warnings from business about the need for the UK to retain close access to European markets. In May a delegation of Europe’s biggest industrial companies met Theresa May and warned that they would not invest in Britain as long as uncertainty over Brexit persisted.Government-commissioned economic analysis suggests being outside customs union would hit growth. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has highlighted the need for single market access for services, which make up 80 percent of the UK economy.The car industry in the UK and on the continent relies on integrated supply chains and frictionless borders. There’ve been reports that EU carmakers may seek to exclude British parts. The road haulage industry is worried about potential disruption.The pharmaceutical industry is encouraged by the UK’s wish to keep close links to the European Medicines Agency, but question marks remain over practicalities.The British government has promised an overhaul of farming subsidies, food production and the environment once the UK is outside the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The fishing industry is looking forward to taking back control of its coastal waters but will have to wait, as the UK will remain in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) during the transition period.Many businesses also want access to European workers and are concerned about future restrictions. Alarm bells have already rung over labour shortages in sectors from construction to the health service, tourism to fruit farms. Hostility to the free movement of EU workers was one of the main reasons for the referendum result, but the British government has still to unveil its post-Brexit immigration policy.Reports quoting government analysis have suggested that some parts of the UK which voted strongly for Brexit will be most heavily impacted, if there is no deal.The head of the UK’s customs service has estimated that even with agreement on the Brexiteers’ favoured customs plan, the bureaucratic cost to business may reach £20 billion (€22.8 billion) - a claim hotly disputed by Brexiteers.Theresa May’s famous Brexit mantra is that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. “A no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone… but above all for the UK,” European Council President Donald Tusk has said.For both sides, failure to reach a deal could bring economic, political and legal chaos at least in the short-term. No agreement could see the UK refuse to settle the withdrawal bill, blowing a big hole in the EU budget. EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent may find their status up in the air again.On trade, World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would apply. Tariffs would be imposed at varying rates. Experts say this would increase costs for UK importers and exporters, raising prices particularly for food. Border controls and customs checks would also increase costs.Brexit supporters argue that the lack of an agreement is no barrier to trade, and the UK could cut or get rid of tariffs altogether. Boris Johnson has suggested the UK would “do very well” under such an arrangement.Non-tariff barriers would hit services, which now operate across the EU via “passporting” rights. The UK would be outside EU regulatory agencies, threatening sectors such as pharmaceuticals and aviation.The UK has been accused of failing to prepare for customs checks and a “no deal scenario” generally – even by some “Leave” supporters.The EU knows that both sides would be damaged by a “no deal” scenario. Ireland especially, its economy so closely linked to Britain, could be particularly badly hit. It’s one reason why hardline Brexiteers argue that the UK should threaten to walk out of talks – to force Brussels to make concessions.Brexit has been described as the United Kingdom’s most significant change since it joined the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, and perhaps since World War II.The fallout from the referendum has exacerbated tensions within the United Kingdom. Scotland voted heavily to remain in the EU, and the result revived questions concerning Scottish independence from the UK – which was rejected in a 2014 referendum. The Irish border conundrum is intensified by the fact that a majority in Northern Ireland wanted the UK to stay in the EU.Theresa May’s position has been weakened since her government lost its majority in the June 2017 general election. It’s now propped up in Parliament thanks to an agreement with Northern Ireland unionists from the DUP.Arguably, the ruling Conservatives' internal divisions over Brexit have cancelled each other out and kept May in power. Both sides fear that toppling her might bring chaos – and possibly a hard-left Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile the pro-EU Liberal Democrats remain a marginal force, despite the growth of a number of anti-Brexit grassroots organisations.The consequences of Brexit are being felt on the continent too. The European Union is losing an existing member for the first time, along with a significant chunk of its budget. It’s a major test of the EU’s ability to withstand the rising tide of Euroscepticism – and calls into question the drive for closer European integration.For more on the history of the UK’s troubled relationship with Europe, see our earlier four-part series here, here, here and here.","header":"What's happening with Brexit: 2 year update","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:15:27.641Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  11/06/2018\n"}

The question has dominated the recent debate over the UK’s departure from the EU.In fact, multiple scenarios are possible in the next few, decisive months as the clock ticks towards March 29, 2019. A UK think-tank has set out in graph form the different ways in which the negotiations and politics could play out.The Institute for Government – a charity dedicated to making government more effective – concludes that the outcome is very hard to predict.However – arguing that the risk of a “no-deal” is quite high – it details the numerous hurdles to an orderly Brexit, and the process each situation would lead to.Four of the five illustrated scenarios look at what would happen if there is a failure to reach or approve an agreement.That doesn’t mean there is only a one-in-five chance of a deal leading to an orderly Brexit. But it does highlight the several different ways in which the process could go wrong for Theresa May’s government.Follow the left-hand column down from Scenario 1 at the top – this illuminates the green path to an “orderly Brexit”, meaning a 21-month transition and detailed talks on the UK’s future relationship with the EU.In this scenario, all hurdles are overcome as negotiations in Brussels bring a deal between the UK and the remaining (EU27) countries on a withdrawal agreement. This is then approved by the British Parliament which has been granted a so-called “meaningful vote”.The outcome is subject to the proviso that Parliament does not put a spanner in the works by trying to change the deal or bind the government’s hands in talks on the future. It also assumes that the European Parliament ratifies the deal.Here, the British Parliament decides to reject the agreement the prime minister brings back from Brussels. It also accepts that this will mean Brexit taking place with no deal.By law the government is then obliged to set out how it intends to proceed and bring a “neutral motion” before Parliament. The think-tank says that an attempt to renegotiate the deal – or persuade Parliament to change its mind – would bring a political crisis.In this scenario, again a deal is struck between the UK and the EU27. However, it is rejected by the British Parliament, which sends the government back to Brussels to renegotiate.What exactly would happen is uncertain, but the Institute for Government says it would depend on the time available, the EU’s willingness to reopen negotiations, and the need for any new deal, in turn, to be approved by Parliament. Otherwise, the outcome would still be a “no-deal” Brexit.The fourth scenario sees the continuing stand-off in Brussels bring no deal on the UK’s EU withdrawal, as both sides find it impossible to resolve their differences.Here, as in scenario 2, the government informs Parliament of its plans and brings a neutral motion. Parliament takes note and the UK heads towards “no deal”.Again the talks in Brussels bring no deal – but here, the British Parliament refuses to accept such an outcome. Instead, it sends the government back to renegotiate.Parliament’s precise role in such circumstances is uncertain and brought fierce debate and an eventual fudge as the government’s Brexit legislation was passed earlier this summer.The same issues as in scenario 3 could be raised – but under an even more compressed timetable.The Institute for Government concludes that “the risks of either a deliberate or an accidental no deal are quite high”.It says the lack of a parliamentary majority for “no deal” means the government could be sent back to renegotiate a better deal. But time constraints increase the pressure for the prime minister to find a majority for an agreement, which is “easier said than done”.The high risk of a stalemate in Parliament could lead to an acrimonious and potentially disruptive “no deal”, the think-tank says.The situation is further complicated by the UK’s political and parliamentary landscape. A stalemate could bring various parliamentary manoeuvres to break the deadlock, a Conservative Party leadership election, a general election – or even a second referendum, the institute says, although it argues that this would be practically difficult.","header":"How the UK's Brexit process works in one chart","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:16:45.311Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  20/08/2018\n"}

Under UK plans outlined last year, EU residents who have been continuously and lawfully living in the UK for five years by 31 December 2020 — when the Brexit transition period expires — will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting settled status.Those who arrive before the end of the transition period but who have not resided in the UK for the required five-year threshold will be able to apply to stay until they have reached it and apply for settled status.Settled status or temporary permission to stay will grant EU citizens the same access as they currently do to healthcare, pensions and other benefits in the UK.Family members who are living with, or join, EU citizens in the UK by 31 December 2020 will also be able to apply for settled status, usually after 5 years in the UK, while close family members (spouses, civil and unmarried partners, dependent children and grandchildren, and dependent parents and grandparents) will be able to join EU citizens after exit, where the relationship existed on 31 December 2020.Ahead of the settlement scheme announcement, Britain’s Home Secretary Sajid Javid criticised EU countries on Thursday for “taking far too long” to outline their plans for Britons living on the continent after Brexit.Javid called on EU member states to “set out how they will support British citizens living in their countries.”“They’re taking far too long,” he posted on Twitter.“Publishing details of how we will administer our settled status scheme shows we are honouring the commitments made towards EU citizens living in the UK,” Javid said in a statement.”“But I am concerned that I have not seen any similar plans on how EU member states are going to support British nationals in their countries. This is not good enough and I hope both the European Parliament and Commission will exert more pressure for them to do this as soon as possible.”There are 3.8 million EU citizens living in the UK and 900,000 Brits residing in the EU, according to official British statistics.The EU Parliament’s chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, who met with Javid in London earlier in the week, echoed the British minister’s call:“I am far from happy with the treatment of UK citizens in the EU27,” he posted on Twitter on Tuesday.“Most Member States have not yet started the process or procedures,” he said, adding that “both the UK \u0026 the EU have a duty to mitigate the damage of #Brexit for citizens.”Javid is to lay out further details about the settled status scheme today, including when it will be rolled out and will cost £65 (€74).The government previously said the application for settled status should cost no more than that of a British passport which costs £75.50 (€86) for an adult, a policy Verhofstadt has criticised.“Why should EU citizens, who have contributed to British society \u0026 paid their taxes, be financially punished for Brexit, when they were denied a vote?,” he posted on Twitter Thursday.","header":"EU citizens must pay €74 to stay in UK after Brexit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:17:27.976Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  21/06/2018\n"}

France's President Emmanuel Macron said the U.K. still has a chance to reverse its exit course.\n    NewslookLONDON — European Union leaders say Britain still can reverse itself and remain in the EU as talks over its exit opened Monday, less than two weeks after election losses by Prime Minister Theresa May's government that could suggest more Brits have second thoughts about leaving the 28-nation alliance.\"Until negotiations come to an end there is always a chance to reopen the door,\" France's newly elected pro-EU leader Emmanuel Macron said last week as May stood at his side in Paris. Germany's powerful finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, also signaled that Britain would be welcome back in the EU if it has a change of mind.So far that does not appear to be the case. May, who lost her gamble by holding parliamentary elections on June 8 to increase her mandate going into the negotiations, is still pledging to make a clean break under the best terms possible.She will negotiate in a weakened position following the elections, which cost her Conservative Party a dozen seats and its majority in Parliament.Other EU members vowed to make Britain pay a steep price for a complete exit by denying it trade benefits and other advantages of a common market. Monday is the first formal step toward a withdrawal that could take two years to negotiate.In a statement, May's government said it was \"confident it can achieve a bold and ambitious deal that will work in the interest of the whole U.K.\"The EU said it was also looking for a good compromise. The bloc's lead negotiator Michel Barnier said Monday that both parties \"must first tackle the uncertainties caused by Brexit — first for citizens, but also for the beneficiaries of the EU policies and for the impact on borders, in particular Ireland.\"British voters approved a Brexit referendum, 52% to 48%, a year ago. Although the country is still deeply divided on the issue, none of the major political parties in the recent vote campaigned against Brexit or pledged to hold a second referendum.Ahead of the vote, May had vowed to sever ties with the bloc's tariff-free single trading market and end reciprocal immigration rights for EU nationals. If dissatisfied with the talks, she even threatened to walk away without paying an expected hefty divorce bill or securing a new trade deal.Her election setback emboldened new talk within her party of a \"softer\" form of Brexit, which would allow Britain to retain some of its privileges by remaining a member of the EU's common market\"We need a good, clean exit which minimizes disruption and maximizes opportunity,\" hard-line Conservative politician Steven Baker tweeted Tuesday. \"In other words, we need the 'softest' exit consistent with actually leaving and controlling laws, money, border and trade.\"Previously, Baker vehemently opposed any attempts to water down terms of Britain's departure from the EU.Former prime ministers David Cameron and Sir John Major have recently urged May to rethink her tough Brexit stance.Cameron said that May needed to \"consult more widely\" with other parties, including opposition groups such as the Labour Party, to figure out what would be in the best interests of the nation and that there was clearly more \"pressure for a soft Brexit.\" Major said that a \"hard Brexit was not endorsed by the electorate.\" Cameron, who had called for the Brexit referendum and campaigned against it, resigned after the June 2016 vote.The EU has refused to engage with Britain about possible Brexit scenarios before the formal negotiations get underway, although it has balked at the idea of letting Britain retain access to the single market without also agreeing to continue to allow open immigration among members. Opposition to open EU borders was a big reason Brexit passed.\"The election has made things far less clear,\" said Anand Menon, a foreign affairs expert at King's College London. \"You'd be a fool to try to predict what will happen. I'm limiting myself to saying that the possibility of certain Brexit outcomes has changed.\"Guy Verhofstadt, who oversees the EU parliament’s Brexit stance, suggested in Strasbourg last Wednesday that if Britain changes its mind and decides to return to the EU, it would be on worse terms.That is wishful thinking, said Michael Bröning, director of foreign policy at Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a Berlin think tank. \"Some people obviously feel that the election was an opportunity to have an 'exit from the Brexit' but it's not rooted in any real development,\" he said. Most \"polls show that a large majority of British people still think that Brexit should still go ahead.\"Nigel Farage, former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party that campaigned for years for Brexit, said European political leaders are still in denial. \"They don't believe we are actually going to leave the EU,\" he said. \"We are going to leave.\"RELATED COVERAGE:Analysis: May's failed election gamble creates chaos","header":"EU says there's still time for U.K. to stay as Brexit talks get underway","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:18:18.307Z"},"time":"5:20 AM"}

As Ciara Lee reports, with no substantial progress on the Irish border conundrum, negotiations could be challenging.\nVideo provided by Reuters\n    NewslookPARIS — France's Normandy region is famous for the D-Day landings and Camembert cheese, but now it longs for another kind of invasion: British entrepreneurs escaping Brexit.The Normandy development agency, AD Normandie, launched a charm offensive in March to urge British business owners to “vote with their feet,” cross the English Channel into France and the European Union — and leave their Brexit fears behind.British voters approved a historic referendum two years ago to separate from the EU, which is slated to happen by March 2019. The United Kingdom's future relationship with the EU is still unclear, as negotiations continue. As a result, many British executives worry that customs, immigration and regulatory barriers could disrupt their business with the 27 other EU nations.  In response, France and many EU countries are rolling out the red carpet.\"You will find the process as smooth as their Camembert ... or their oysters for that matter,\" said one ad plastered on a double-decker bus that AD Normandie hired to tour London and other British towns. The bus parodied the pro-Brexit buses that were part of the Vote Leave campaign.A tongue-in-cheek personal ad in a mock newspaper called the Normandy Times ran in British papers — seeking a “hot entrepreneur” who “must have an appetite for business, beautiful coastal walks and long sun-drenched lunches with wine flowing.”Transport for London, which manages the Tube and other mass transit, rejected using the ad in its stations and vehicles, calling it “controversial.”About 30 small- to medium-sized British companies have requested meetings to discuss setting up business in France, said Alexandre Wahl, who heads AD Normandie. “A week after the campaign ended, three of them came to Normandy to see what could be possible,” Wahl said. “These companies don’t know what will happen with Brexit, but they are aware things won’t be the same.”Companies that rely heavily on the EU market — such as the automotive, aerospace and high-tech industries — worry they won’t be able to secure components or hire foreign talent once Britain leaves the EU. Some businesses are considering alternative headquarters in the EU. For example, the British budget airline easyJet set up a subsidiary in Austria last year so it can operate flights between EU countries after Brexit.Such moves could continue, although many British businesses are adopting a “wait-and-see” approach until a final deal is reached between Britain and the EU.“This is part of a long game,” said Alasdair Darroch of Altios UK, a firm that advises companies on international business development. “No doubt in 10 years time, there will be more divergence in the relationship between the U.K. and Europe. It’s going to be important for some companies to have a base in Europe where they can keep trading without complications.\"To entice British businesses, Normandy has set up a special zone offering tax breaks and grants up to $123,000 to foreign companies that decamp to France. There are also incentives for families to resettle in the area, which is already the home of 8,500 British expatriates because of its proximity to both southern England and Paris.This special economic area — the first in France — will be key to attract foreign businesses, said Hervé Morin, president of the Normandy regional council. “It’s very well placed because it’s close to the industrial port of Le Havre.\"Normandy’s sweet talk follows similar moves by Paris and other European capitals to lure banking giants based in London’s financial district.Shortly after the Brexit referendum passed in June 2016, Paris' La Defense business district plastered billboards at London's Heathrow airport and the London stop for Eurostar trains with the irreverent slogan:  “Tired of the fog? Try the Frogs!”The moves come as French President Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, wants to capitalize on Brexit woes to attract foreign investments and shake France’s reputation as being unfriendly to business because of high taxes and maddening bureaucracy.Central to Marcon’s vision is to beef up France's financial sector, which is tiny compared to London. No big banks have left London so far, but large American and British banks have proposed expanding their offices in France as Brexit approaches.More: London, Paris teaming up to attract international touristsMore: Sacre bleu!

Ahead of the vote, here's a guide to what's being called \"Brexit.\"WHAT IS 'BREXIT'?It's a combination of the words \"British\" and \"exit\" and refers to the potential departure of Britain from the EU, a 28-nation economic and political alliance. The EU was founded in 1993, but its origins can be traced back to 1951 when Germany, France and other countries in the region sought to create a peaceful coalition in the aftermath of World War II.\"Brexit\" was coined by The Economist magazine in 2012. The expression is also a twist on \"Grexit,\" which was used to describe Greece's potential withdrawal from the eurozone, a subset of 19 EU member states that share the euro currency.WHY IS THIS VOTE HAPPENING?British Prime Minister David Cameron promised to hold a referendum on the issue as part of his 2015 re-election campaign. Cameron complained that the bloc has evolved gradually into a powerful bureaucracy that infringes on British sovereignty and its national interests on issues such as trade, immigration, financial and labor regulation and social spending.USA TODAYBrexit - Latest World \u0026 National News \u0026 Headlines - USATODAY.comCameron recently won concessions from the EU to give Britain more say over these issues and he now favors continued membership in the bloc. However, many members of his Conservative Party oppose his position and are campaigning for a Brexit. The anti-immigration, anti-EU UK Independence Party, which has gained support because of a backlash against Muslim migrants entering Britain, also is campaigning for a Brexit.IS THE VOTE BINDNG?The vote on the question \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\" is not legally binding but Cameron has promised to abide by it. If Brexit passes, the British Parliament would have to repeal EU membership laws.Voters must be 18 or older and a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen who resides in Britain. British nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years can also vote. Citizens of EU countries other than Ireland, Malta and Cyprus who live in the U.K. will not be able to vote.USA TODAYBritain's historic EU referendum to be held on June 23WHY IS THE OUTCOME IMPORTANT?The prospect of Britain leaving the EU creates vast uncertainty for the alliance at a time it is dealing with a number of major problems, including a growing migration crisis, an unpredictable and increasingly interventionist Russia on its eastern flank, and the prospect of more terror attacks.The loss of Britain, one of the wealthiest and influential EU nations, could weaken the bloc's cohesion and effectiveness. The economic impact of a \"Brexit\" also would be significant by reducing trade, investment and economic growth throughout the region, the International Monetary Fund warned. A possible exit has investors nervous and could spark a drop in stock markets and volatile swings in currency exchange rates.On May 12, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that a vote to leave the bloc could lead to a \"technical recession.\"There also is the question of what it would mean for the 3 million EU nationals who live and work in Britain under the EU's free movement of labor laws. Also, If Britain leaves the EU, Scotland, which favors remaining in the bloc, likely would push for another independence referendum so it would not be forced out. Pro-independence forces narrowly lost a previous referendum.During a visit to London in April, President Obama urged Britain to stay in the EU because it \"gives (the United States) much greater confidence about the strength of the trans-Atlantic union.\"USA TODAYInfluential London Mayor Boris Johnson joins 'Brexit' campaignIN OR OUT — WHICH WAY WILL IT GO?A poll by market research firm Survation for spread-betting company IG published June 21 said 45% supported \"remain\" and 44% supported \"leave.\" Another poll by YouGov for The Times newspaper published late on June 20 said 42% would vote to remain, 44% would vote to leave, and 9% didn't know.It came after two polls published during the weekend before the vote suggested that support had swung back toward remaining in the EU.Polling is not always reliable in the U.K. The British polling industry incorrectly predicted a neck-and-neck race last May between Britain's two main parties, Conservative and Labour.

Julian Satterthwaite reports\nVideo provided by Reuters\n    NewslookLONDON — Eighteen months after Britons narrowly voted to leave the European Union, Brexit is having a growing negative impact on the United Kingdom. As the U.K. takes part in a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to assess the progress of its EU divorce talks, the cost of leaving the political bloc continues to climb for Britain.That is raising questions about whether a divorce is still worth it. A poll published in October by YouGov, an online research firm, showed 47% of Brits thought the country was wrong to vote to leave the EU, compared to 42% who said it was the right thing to do.The same YouGov study found that just 18% want a second vote and only 14% would opt to abandon Brexit completely. A slight majority, 52%, think Brexit should \"go ahead.\"Jon Worth, an expert on EU affairs who is staunchly pro-EU, said he does not see a second national vote until there are more dramatic Brexit impacts on ordinary life. \"Brexit hasn't yet entered into everyday peoples' consciousness,\" he said.Here are the current negative consequences of Brexit on the U.K.:Britain has agreed to pay the EU $54 billion to honor existing budget commitments on everything from EU officials' pensions to investments in European infrastructure. The bill could climb before the country leaves the EU in March 2019.More: Brexit: UK Parliament backs final say in EU divorce, delivering major blow to Theresa MayThe RAND Corp. published a study this week that suggests Britain is likely to be economically worse off outside of the EU under most scenarios. For example, RAND's analysis shows that if Britain leaves the EU without agreeing to a new trade deal with the bloc, its GDP could lose 5%, or $140 billion, over 10 years.Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, said that due to volatility in currency markets and an increasingly uncertain business environment, Brexit has already knocked about 1% off of Britain's GDP. \"We have a reasonably good idea of what's happened so far. What comes next ranges from 'no impact' to pretty serious,'\" he said.  In the year after the June 2016 vote, the British pound lost 16% of its value against the dollar, according to Bloomberg data. There were similar steep declines against the euro.The pound has clawed back 9% of this loss against the dollar in 2017, but not before pushing up inflation, strangling wage growth and reducing consumer spending power. Companies operating in Britain's services sector — hotels, restaurants, banks — raised prices in November at the fastest pace in nearly a decade, according to data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Many blamed the weaker pound and Brexit-related uncertainty for the acceleration in prices.On the bright side, the weaker pound has boosted U.K. exports and made Britain a more appealing tourism destination for foreigners. Overseas residents made 3.9 million visits to Britain in August, up 5% from a year earlier, figures released last month by the country's Office for National Statistics show.There were 1.9 million visits by U.S. tourists between January and June 2017, up 31% compared to the year earlier, according to VisitBritain, the country's tourism agency.London's status as Europe's financial capital is threatened by Brexit.A key attraction for global banks and financial service firms is that Britain offers relatively easy access in an English-speaking setting to markets in 27 other EU countries.However, Brexit could cause a loss of as many as 75,000 jobs in the banking and insurance industry, as major firms such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and UBS Group question whether to shift operations and staff elsewhere in the EU, Sam Woods, Britain's top banking regulator, told lawmakers last month.In addition, the EU selected Paris as the new home of the European Banking Authority, the industry's regulator. The move from London was required by Brexit.      \"Brexit uncertainty looms over almost every aspect of doing business in the U.K.,\" Paul Drechsler, president of the Confederation of British Industry, a lobbying group, said last week. \"Companies are having to plan for worst while hoping for the best.\"","header":"How much is Brexit costing Brits?

Those include the rights of citizens affected by Brexit, Britain’s financial obligations to the EU and how to keep open the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.Leaders of the other 27 EU members are expected to ratify the agreement later this week, allowing Brexit talks to move on to trade and security cooperation. May told Parliament the next phase would not be easy but that the atmospherics have improved.“Of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” May said in a statement. “But there is, I believe, a new sense of optimism now in the talks and I fully hope and expect that we will confirm the arrangements I have set out today in the European Council later this week.”She said the implementation period she seeks will be discussed in the next phase of the talks, and called for discussions to begin immediately.But weekend comments by the official in charge of the talks have threatened to spoil May’s triumphant moment. In an interview with the BBC on Sunday, Brexit chief David Davis suggested that last week’s agreement was a “statement of intent” that wasn’t legally binding.The comments caused unease in Ireland, where leaders demanded provisions in the agreement to ensure Brexit won’t restrict travel and trade between the Republic of Ireland and the U.K.’s Northern Ireland. Officials in both parts of the island say the border must remain open to protect the Irish peace process.The Irish government branded Davis’ comments “bizarre” and insisted that Britain must live up to the commitments it made last week.Davis Monday tried to mitigate the fallout, insisting his words had been “completely twisted.”“What I actually said yesterday … was we want to protect the peace process, want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them, and I said this was a statement of intent which was much more than just legally enforceable,” Davis told LBC Radio.“In the event that the withdrawal agreement doesn’t happen then we would still be seeking to maintain an invisible border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” he added. “I was making the point that it was much more than just in the treaty, it’s what we want to do anyway.”The confusion prompted Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to question the government’s competence.“We respect the result of the referendum but due to this government’s shambolic negotiations it’s getting increasingly difficult to believe this is a government capable of negotiating a good deal for Britain,” he said.More: Brexit: Where the U.K.’s divorce from the EU standsMore: Britain, EU reach 11th-hour deal to keep talking about BrexitMore: No breakthrough in Brexit talks, says EU's Jean-Claude JunckerHe pressed May for details about the “divorce bill” Britain will have to pay to leave the EU.In Brussels, the Europeans were thinking about form as well as substance.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that while the deal was not legally binding, it was regarded as a pact of honor.“We see the joint report of (EU Brexit negotiator) Michel Barnier and David Davis as a deal between gentlemen and it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the U.K. government,” he said. He noted that EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed on that with May on Friday. “They shook hands.” ","header":"U.K. leader says there’s new optimism in Brexit talks","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:20:22.076Z"},"time":"5:20 AM"}

Davis also said his government would not pay its €40 billion to €45 billion ($47 billion to $52 billion) divorce bill if Britain failed to gain what it wanted from a new trade deal.The EU immediately warned the U.K. about backtracking on its promises, as it could affect future relations between Britain and the other 27 members of the bloc.\"While I am optimistic as far as the second phase is concerned, we have to ensure that the joint report presented last week is fully and faithfully translated into the wording of the exit treaty,\" EU Parliament President Antonio Tajani said after Wednesday's vote.\"No discussions on future relations will take place if the principles contained are not implemented.\"Britain's parliament is set to vote on moving to the next round of talks later on Wednesday.\n    97 cents...that’s all it took for Russia to buy three ads on Facebook with the intent of influencing the Brexit vote.\n    Buzz60   ","header":"Brexit: UK Parliament backs final say in EU divorce, delivering major blow to Theresa May","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:20:59.461Z"},"time":"5:20 AM"}

Another 6% said they would definitely not choose Britain to study as a result of the Brexit vote.Government figures also showed the number of Indian students at British universities fell 10% in the past year because of concerns about immigration.The loss is costly. According to Oxford Economics, spending by international students in 2014-15 supported 206,600 jobs in U.K. university towns and cities. International students pay tuition ranging from $12,000 to $43,000 a year, while British and EU students pay up to $11,380 a year.More: Theresa May: UK seeks 2-year transition period after BrexitYinbo Yu, 25, an economics student from China who represents international students in the National Union of Students, said some of his friends who did their undergraduate degrees in the U.K. were moving to Australia, Canada and the United States for their masters or further study.In Australia, nearly 50,000 Chinese students began courses in 2016, up 23% from 2015. Gary Fan, a student at the University of Sydney's business school, told the Financial Review website that one of the draws for him was a temporary graduate visa that allows students to work in Australia for up to four years after they graduate.By contrast, Yu said, the U.K. government has scrapped a post-study work visa program and is now charging them to use the National Health Service.Moreover, Prime Minister Theresa May’s government has classified foreign students as immigrants as part of a drive to lower net migration to less than 100,000 a year. Unlimited immigration from EU countries was a major reason the Brexit referendum passed. “The government really has to look into these issues and find ways to protect our international students,” Yu said.The U.K. government says its restrictions on foreign students stems from the fact that many remained in the country illegally after completing their studies.“The British government wanted for some really good reasons to tighten up some things and they’ve sort of overdone it,” said Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield.

The three ads also targeted U.S. audiences. Britain's Electoral Commission had requested that Facebook look into any dubious activity in last year's Brexit vote after an earlier probe by the firm into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election uncovered more than 3,000 ads targeting U.S. voters.More: Facebook defends advertising 'principles' after Russia, discriminationThe ads targeting U.S. voters were run from 470 fake or inauthentic accounts and pages linked to the Internet Research Agency, which spent around $100,000 on them.  Moscow has consistently denied trying to meddle in the Brexit vote.

They were right and will be proved right in the decades ahead,” he added.However, aviation giant Airbus warned on Friday it could pull out of Britain if it leaves the EU without a deal, while carmaker BMW also warned that uncertainty was affecting the investment climate.The march against Brexit is part of a “summer of action” planned by campaign groups to put pressure on political leaders to hold a vote on the final deal.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e8bb56dba1b08b5a8cb8e"},"url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/do-your-brexit-duty-britains-may-tells-her-divided-govt/","content":"Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday urged her government to do its duty and agree a plan for Britain’s future outside the European Union, a last-ditch appeal to ministers to put Brexit rows behind them and take a “step forward”.Just hours before hosting a meeting at her Chequers country residence on Friday that she hopes will overcome deep rifts that have hampered Britain’s Brexit plans, May urged her cabinet to agree a way to push on with all-but-stalled talks with the EU.A united stance from the government cannot come soon enough for an increasingly frustrated EU and for many companies, which have stepped up their warnings of the risk to tens of thousands of jobs if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal.But the first details of May’s new plan for close customs ties with the EU – a “facilitated customs arrangement” – won mixed reviews, with one Brexit campaigner saying it could leave the country out of Europe, but still run by Europe.Her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, held a meeting of pro-Brexit ministers to plan a counter-attack to May’s plans, and it was not clear whether the customs proposal, which critics say relies on unproven technology, would win support in Brussels.“The cabinet meets at Chequers … to agree the shape of our future relationship with the European Union. In doing so, we have a great opportunity – and a duty,” May said before her ministers set off for the 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London.“Now is the time for another step forward. We want a deal that allows us to deliver the benefits of Brexit – taking control of our borders, laws and money and by signing ambitious new trade deals with countries like the U.S, Australia and New Zealand,” she added in a statement.Her effective deputy, cabinet office minister David Lidington, said he was confident that ministers, who have long been at odds over how close Britain’s future relationship with the EU should be, would reach a “concrete position”.The stakes are high.May has been reluctant to spell out her Brexit vision for fear of angering one faction or another.That inaction has frustrated businesses and helped weaken the pound, which is down almost 10 percent since mid-April.The chief executive of European plane-maker Airbus, Tom Enders, accused the government of having “no clue or at least consensus on how to execute Brexit without severe harm”, and defended an earlier warning over the risk to jobs.But with only nine months before Britain leaves the bloc and just over three months before the EU says it wants a deal, she has been forced to act.On Thursday, May made her opening gambit to overcome the deep divisions in not only her government, but in her Conservative Party, parliament and across Britain by suggesting a new customs plan to keep trade flowing as freely as possible.It would see Britain closely mirror EU rules, use technology to determine where goods will end up and therefore which tariffs should be applied, and hand London the freedom to set its own tariffs on incoming goods. Britain would also be able to strike trade deals with other countries, her spokeswoman said.But Brexit campaigners, including at least two ministers in her cabinet, fear that the plan will keep Britain in the EU’s customs sphere.That, Brexit supporters say, would be a betrayal of her pledge for a clean break with the bloc and for Britain to win the ability to strike out alone.Her office has so far made public only a few details of the plan and it may be changed at the Chequers meeting, which is expected to run all day and possibly late into the evening.Even if she finds agreement at home, May still faces the hard task of winning the support of the EU, which poured cold water on her previous suggestions for customs arrangements and pressed her to come up with “workable” proposals.But for now, May hopes to concentrate minds at home.“This is about agreeing an approach that delivers decisively on the verdict of the British people – an approach that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU, and crucially, one that commands the support of the public and parliament,” she said.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU (single market / customs union)? Is it an all-weather backstop?” he said.The Irish government — which is pressing for “substantial progress” on the issue by an EU summit later this month — said it would consider the proposals.However, the European Parliament’s chief negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, warned against trying to impose a time limit, saying: “A backstop that is temporary is not a backstop.”– Fudged document –The idea of the backstop is controversial with eurosceptics, who fear it will keep Britain tied to the EU’s rules for years after it leaves the bloc on March 29, 2019.Reports that Davis might quit unless there was a time limit have been swirling for several days.His chief of staff, Stewart Jackson, tweeted Thursday that there had been a “helpful dialogue” and the paper now included more detail on “the time limited nature of our proposal”.“This is a clear compromise to keep David from resigning, but it does undermine Theresa hugely,” one pro-European MP in May’s Conservative Party said.Others questioned the substance of the proposal.“After weeks of the government negotiating with itself, the fudged document they have produced doesn’t engage with any of the key Brexit dilemmas,” said opposition Labour MP Chris Leslie.“It is highly unlikely to lead to anything but more gridlock in the ongoing talks with the EU.”May also held separate meetings on Thursday with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, both leading eurosceptics.On Wednesday reporters asked Davis if he would quit if the backstop did not have his explicit approval, replying: “That’s a question I think for the prime minister, to be honest.”Asked if she expected Davis to remain in his position on Thursday, May’s spokeswoman said: “Yes… of course.”All sides in the Brexit negotiations have committed to avoiding any physical infrastructure on the Irish border, where free movement of people and goods is viewed as key to peace on the island.But the government is struggling to find a way to fulfil this commitment while sticking to its plan to leave the EU’s single market and customs union after Brexit.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

The popularism of left and right is, you know, (at) risk of breaking the back of Western politics,” Blair said.He admitted that “the centre ground of politics is pretty absent at the moment” — but denied suggestions he could help form a new centrist party in Britain.His own Labour party has moved to the political left since he was in charge, and while many of its MPs are pro-European, its socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn is more sceptical.Labour backs Brexit but has called for a new customs union with the EU, and has refused to rule out a second vote.Blair said that for all his hopes of stopping Brexit, it depended on “whether at the top of the Labour party the leader, the people around the leader, still want Brexit to go through”.But he said he hoped it would “come back to sense”, adding that in the meantime, he would press his case.AFPOver the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e8c0f6dba1b08b5a8cd3b"},"url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/948960/","content":"Prime Minister Theresa May will call Friday for an unprecedented free trade deal with the EU after Brexit in a major speech, but is expected to acknowledge that Britain will have to make sacrifices in its economic relationship.As tensions with Brussels soar over the implications for Northern Ireland, May will also emphasise that Britain wants to be “good friends and neighbours” with the EU, a minister said.In a much-anticipated major speech, just weeks before trade talks are due to start in Brussels, May will argue Britain must forge its own path free from the bloc’s current rules.But she will call for the “broadest and deepest possible agreement, covering more sectors and co-operating more fully than any free trade agreement anywhere in the world today”.May will say this is “achievable” because “rather than having to bring two different systems closer together, the task will be to manage the relationship once we are two separate legal systems”.EU leaders have been pressing the prime minister to clarify what she wants before they agree their position on the future economic partnership at a summit later this month.Brussels raised the pressure this week with a draft treaty suggesting Northern Ireland could stay in a customs union with the EU while the rest of Britain remained outside.– Fall-back option –The proposal is a fall-back option if London fails to come up with a better solution to avoid new customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, where some fear a “hard border” could upset the fragile peace.But it prompted outrage in Westminster, where May warned it threatened the integrity of her country and was something that “no UK prime minister could ever agree to”.A senior minister indicated Friday that May would however use her speech to address accusations — including by two former British prime ministers this week — that she has not been honest about the downsides of Brexit.“She is going to recognise that there are things that we can’t have as we leave the single market and as we leave the customs union,” transport secretary Chris Grayling told BBC radio.But she would set out areas that would benefit both sides, including staying part of some EU agencies such as on aviation, he said, adding that Britain wants to be “good friends and neighbours”.– ‘No frictionless trade’ –In a speech that had to be moved at the last minute from the northeast of England to London due to bad weather, May will emphasise that the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU “was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money”.But EU President Donald Tusk warned Thursday ahead of talks with the prime minister that Britain could not expect to sever formal ties with its closest trading partner and still reap the same benefits.“There can be no frictionless trade outside of the customs union and the single market,” he said.May’s government is divided on the way forward, and her speech was drawn up following a marathon meeting of senior ministers last week, and endorsed in a special session of the full cabinet on Thursday.Eurosceptics warn that staying in the customs union and single market are akin to not leaving the EU at all, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has suggested the Northern Ireland issue was being used to force a change in strategy.Jacob Rees-Mogg, a leading eurosceptic lawmaker in May’s Conservative party, told AFP that there were “technological solutions” to avoiding a hard Irish border.He said that for Britain to stay in a customs union, forced to follow EU rules while losing its seat at the table as an EU member, would be “fatal for Brexit”.However, the main opposition Labour party on Monday came out in favour of the idea, which is already backed by the main business lobby groups.Their change in stance raises the stakes in parliament, which will vote on the final exit deal and where May has only a slim majority.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e8c286dba1b08b5a8cd90"},"url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/12/may-brexit-deal-personal-achievement/","content":"By Morak Babajide-AlabiOn Friday, the BREXIT negotiations took a step forward as the EU and the United Kingdom officials made a breakthrough pact in Brussels, the capital city of Belgium and headquarters of the European Union.While the final deal is months away, the announcement has signified the commencement of the second phase of negotiations for UK’s exit from the union.Although the celebrations for the “feat” achieved on Friday has been very sombre, the importance of the conclusion of this first phase cannot be overemphasised. Theresa May, the UK Prime Minister might not have indulged herself in any political song and dance about the events, she knew deep in her mind that it was a “personal achievement”, as confirmed by the European Council President Donald Tusk.To the other EU member countries represented by the President of the European Commission Jean Claude-Juncker and other bureaucrats, the success achieved on Friday was commendable. Mr Juncker said:  “I believe we have now made the breakthrough we need.”No one should blame them for allowing a little celebration, after what Mrs May said was made possible by little “give and take” on both sides.  This might be insignificant in the journey towards the final divorce, but I have a feeling the other 27 member countries seem to know that they have Britain’s balls in their palms.Going by the details of the agreement, the majority of citizens who voted to leave during June 23, 2016, referendum are biting their fingernails and wondering if they did not make a mistake. Let’s be honest here, most Leave voters did so to protest EU’s liberal hold on immigration and movement within the union. And by extension the UK’s annual huge bill to the union.Disappointment is a mild word to describe how they felt on learning about the concessions that were made before the Friday deal. Apart from the huge divorce bill, the status quo is maintained as per immigration. EU citizens would still be allowed to reside in the UK “within the specified date”. This was not part of the pre-referendum campaign promises.The deal would guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the rest of the EU have the right to stay. It also affirms the rights of their children and those of partners in existing “durable relationships”. While UK courts will preside over enforcing rights over EU citizens in Britain they can still refer unclear cases to the European court of justice for eight years after withdrawal.When May rose from her bed in London on Friday morning, the minus zero temperature that descended on the UK overnight was not on her mind.  Making her way to Brussels to rouse the European bureaucrats out of their beds was the priority.  It was not her first visit, but on this occasion, she knows that her Premiership and the future of her country were at stake.Through the night, May had been in meetings with her “Confidence and Supply” partners – Democratic Union Party (DUP) – to sort out the wordings of the “agreement” she presented to Brussels. She could not afford to miss it this time around. The DUP has kept May in Downing Street so far by aligning with her minority government.May’s heart would definitely have been in her mouth as the aircraft taxied to a halt in the pre-dawn dash to Brussels. Wondering if the visit would be a flop as that of Monday, May would be more terrified by the unpredictability of the EU negotiators. They are like hawks and there is tendency they would overlook the fact that she had bent backwards to honour the demands of her DUP partners. May also knew she leads a very hard to please political class, a very demanding opposition and the highly sceptical public.By May’s demeanour, you cannot call her a pushover. Not by any standard. Her utterances and pronouncements while serving as the Home Office Secretary are legendary.  She was notorious for talking tough on immigration and police budget cuts in the two-terms of David Cameron’s administration.  Unfortunately, since becoming the Prime Minister there have been less of these tough talks.The task of negotiating a good deal for the UK seems very tasking than her stay at the Home Office. Every time there seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel for her and the negotiating team,  a spanner is thrown at the wheel. The confidence May exuded last week Monday when she boarded the plane to Brussel was efficacious than her trip on Friday. She was a little uncertain in her steps.May and her team realised how much this deal meant to the progress of the BREXIT negotiations, but they failed to sample the opinion of the “kingmakers” in Belfast before the Monday meeting. This mistake, which eventually put May in a very difficult situation, prompted the second visit to Brussels on Friday.When May arrived at the press conference on Friday, you could, by her body language, conclude that her sacrifice and all-night negotiations with the “kingmakers” had paid off. The main contention for stalling the negotiations on Monday, among others, had been the Irish border issue.  The DUP leaders wanted an assurance that Northern Ireland would get the same treatment as the rest of the country. And in getting this, there won’t be a hard border between Ireland and Great Britain.This is a very understandable request from the Irish front because a hard BREXIT would have driven a wedge between the two Irelands in terms of a physical border. This would have negated the terms of the popular Good Friday/Belfast peace agreement in 1999. This was a momentous agreement in terms of relationships between the Irish and the UK government.The Irish border issue has become contentious as the BREXIT negotiations progressed. There were fears of the return to the days when there were physical borders and immigration controls. While the deal has now somewhat put to rest the border issue, it has also highlighted the weakening of the terms of Britain’s exit.Reacting to May and Juncker’s announcement, Foster, the DUP leader said she was happy her party was able to make six substantial changes to the earlier deal that was presented on Monday.  She said: “There is no red line down the Irish sea and clear confirmation that the entirety of the UK is leaving the European Union, leaving the single market and leaving the customs union.”These events have once again reiterated the fact that the BREXIT vote was a gargantuan mistake on the part of UK. Watching Michael Gove, UK’s Environment Secretary and one of the leading Leave supporters praising the deal was very uncomfortable. Justifying the divorce bill, he said, it would allow Britain to invest more in the NHS. I just could not get his point. So is Nigel Farage.This same Gove that one year ago said UK was paying too much into EU. Politicians will always be politicians, standing on the side of populism, no matter how wrong it may be. The losers are the voters who still have the Polish decorators to “contend” with as neighbours and colleagues for quite some time. And to think this is the basis of BREXIT in the first place is mind-boggling.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

Earlier this week tensions rose when the EU published a draft treaty suggesting Northern Ireland could stay in a customs union while the rest of Britain remained outside.The proposal is a fall-back option if London fails to come up with a better solution to avoid new customs checks with EU-member Ireland.But May reacted with outrage, and repeated Friday that she would “not allow anything that would damage the integrity of our precious Union”.She insisted that it was possible to avoid physical checks through technology and schemes such as trusted trader programmes, although is yet to publish detailed proposals.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

No. It’s not only football, eh? For me, there’s been a few strange decisions in 16-17: Brexit, [Donald] Trump, Ranieri…“Do I have to understand it all the time? No. Obviously not as it happens still. I have no idea why Leicester did this. Everybody can see their situation in the league, everyone can see their situation in the Champions League, but they are not in it.“He is a really special person in this business, a really nice guy, I have to say. I met him before when he visited me at [Borussia] Dortmund and we had a nice talk there. He’s wonderful. I don’t know enough though so maybe you should go to Leicester’s press conference and ask them why they did it.“After this press conference, we will have our opposition meeting, so we will see how our scouts react on this. [First] game without Ranieri, I don’t think they will change it, I am not sure. Probably the two assistants will [take charge], so that’s not a change, it’s only a little different situation.“Of course, probably the players have to show a few things and they want to — and our job is to not let them, that’s difficult enough.

Forty-five members of the UK parliament said Commonwealth countries may get fast-tracked visas to the UK after Brexit if the proposal sails through. UK Telegraph reports that the suggestion was made in a letter addressed to the home secretary, Amber Rudd. According to the letter, Commonwealth stood with Britain when it witnessed “existential threats”, but that UK has left its allies in the cold as it “pivoted to Europe.” The letter read, “I am writing to urge you to extend the hand of friendship to our Commonwealth partners.“In the previous century, Commonwealth countries stood with Britain as we faced existential threats from abroad but as we pivoted to Europe, increasingly, our Commonwealth allies were left in the cold. “The lack of consideration for Commonwealth citizens is at its starkest at our border. While EU citizens are collecting their luggage or exchanging greetings with loved ones, our Commonwealth friends wait tirelessly in the ‘All other passports’ queue. “Firstly, signs at border control that class every non-EU national as ‘All other passports’ should be changed to ‘The Commonwealth and all other passports’. This is a small step but one that can be enacted quickly. “Secondly, the government must commit to examine ways to reduce wait times for Commonwealth citizens entering the UK, perhaps through the use of dedicated Commonwealth border control gates. “Entry processing may not be as quick as in the EU channel as several of the 52 Commonwealth nations require a visa for travel to the UK however, this would send out an important message about the value Britain places on its relationship with the Commonwealth.” Another suggestion made was that Commonwealth citizens be allowed access to the registered traveller scheme, which would allow them access to use UK/EU lanes and reduce time spent waiting in line. They added, “Finally, access to the Registered Traveller Scheme should be further expanded to include additional Commonwealth countries. This programmee, predominately aimed at the business traveler, allows some foreign nationals who meet specific requirements to register and use the UK/EU lanes and e-passport gates, dramatically reducing the time spent waiting in line.“Home secretary, you are in a position to effect real, positive change in our relations with our Commonwealth partners. It would be a shame to let this opportunity pass us by.‎”UK ex-minister speaks on conflict in Nigeria’s governmentNASS siege: What UK, US, EU others should do to sponsors of invasion – Timi FrankUK reacts to National Assembly invasionAnti-graft war: UK govt paying lip-service to Nigeria’s effort – Senator UtaziBoko Haram: UK parliament decides on Leah Sharibu’s ordealUS, UK to continue joint funding for elections in NigeriaCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","header":"Brexit: UK set to grant Nigerians fast-tracked visas","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:29:21.667Z"},"time":"\nPublished\non February 12, 2017\n\n"}

So, these are some of the implications,” he said.Akinterinwa added that Brexit could also affect Nigeria’s and ECOWAS’ relationship with the EU.According to him, since Britain is not part of the Schengen Visa Regime, anyone going to Britain must apply for visa directly for Britain.“Since the purpose for withdrawing from the EU is to emphasise British sovereignty, the British will now be in a better position to deal with international migrants in its context.“There are three million migrants in the UK, while we talk about 1.2 million Britons living in the other parts of Europe.“In this case, the issue of migration becomes an important matter on the strategic calculations of the government.“It means that the immigrants are likely to cut a rough deal; they are not likely to be given the type of accommodation they currently have.“The UK border will now be in a better position to control the inflow and outflow of tourists to the UK,” he explained.Akinterinwa, however, said that with the Brexit already hurting the Pound Sterling and the Euro, it was positive for Nigeria.“With the Brexit, the Pound Sterling has fallen as against the U.S. Dollar; the Euro too has also fallen.“Investors, immediately, for fear of the unknown began to move their investments thinking of relocation and that immediately affected the value of the Pound and it began to fall.“So, the parity of the naira to the Pound Sterling, if the Pound Sterling is falling, is good for Nigeria; it is a welcome development at that level,” he said.NANNigeria will no longer be a by-word for corruption – BuhariMiyetti Allah now ruling Nigeria for asking Saraki to resign – Benue govtWhy Nigeria must be restructured – Edwin ClarkNFF crisis: Pinnick reacts as Nigeria escapes FIFA banAgabus Pwanagba: Nigeria, a nation in dire need of political ideologyEld-el-Kabir: Abia Muslim community urges FG to end poverty in NigeriaCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","header":"Brexit portends negative consequences for Nigeria – Prof. Akinterinwa","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:30:24.787Z"},"time":"\nPublished\non June 24, 2016\n\n"}

Stay in the EU,” as they set off for the Westminster political district.“I was genuinely stunned on the morning after the vote,” said one marcher, Nathaniel Samson, 25, from Hertfordshire north of London.“I feel deeply uncertain about my future,” he added. “I’m on the march to voice my discontentment. I am accepting the result, but it’s to show that we won’t accept it quietly.”London voted 60 per cent in favour of remaining in the EU in last Thursday’s referendum, with younger voters widely in favour of staying in the bloc, but 52 per cent of Britons overall cast ballots in favour of leaving.Rally organiser, King’s College graduate Kieran MacDermott, said: “We can prevent Brexit by refusing to accept the referendum as the final say and take our finger off the self-destruct button.”Parliament should have the final say on whether Britain should leave, he told the BBC.The vote to leave has prompted a battle within the ruling Conservative party to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron who said he would resign after the result.The main opposition Labour Party has also turned on itself, with most of its lawmakers in parliament having voted to withdraw support for party leader Jeremy Corbyn after what they saw as his lacklustre contribution to the referendum campaign.

On that day, the referendum on the UK’s European Union (EU) membership was held. The result shows that 52% of British voted to leave the EU and 48% voted to remain in the EU. The breakdown of the result across the UK shows that England and Wales voted strongly for Brexit – the word that represents leaving the EU – while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted for Bremain – the word that represents staying in the EU. The dust raised by the outcome of the referendum has not yet settled – the fallout panic from Brexit is still evident, with volatility in the global financial markets staring us in the face. The Economist Intelligence Unit has hinted that panic would continue as uncertainty that Brexit brings persists. Across the world the implications of Brexit have become topical and its ramifications cut across fields of study. Pundits around the world have expressed opinions with trumpeting calls to explore possible interventions in order to address the fallout panic from Brexit. This article examines what Brexit means for Africa, and argues that Africa stands to gain if African countries focus on the economic dimension of Africa’s regional integration. This will enable Africa negotiate better trade relations with the UK and the EU.Following the UK’s EU referendum, opinions are divided among pundits on what Brexit means for Africa. Clearly, Brexit brings uncertainties to the global markets, as evidence has shown from post-Brexit financial losses. Africa is integrated into the global markets through the commodity markets of African countries. Also, to a large extent, Africa is integrated into the global financial markets through the listing of many African companies in the global stock markets. Prima facie, the uncertainties rising from Brexit appears to have zero immediate effect on African markets. This is because the referendum was not premised on issues facing African economies. The referendum was rather underpinned largely by political sentiments within the EU, though there are economic sentiments.However, the impact of Brexit on Africa will depend on when the toll of Brexit on European market begins to kick European countries – which the majority of African countries have trade relations with – in the teeth. It is until then that Africa will begin to feel the pains of Brexit. As Africa and Europe are major trading partners – which explains why the effect of Brexit on the EU will have spill-over effects on Africa – the expectation is that Brexit will continue to contribute to increased uncertainty in the global (financial) markets and the risks associated with the global (financial) markets, thereby contributing to the risks that Africa will face in the coming years.For decades now, the EU has had significant impact on the UK’s foreign policy in Africa. In terms of trade, aid and diplomacy, the UK has remained the most attracted and committed EU member state in Africa. The UK has shared with the EU its (UK) policy-making processes and strategies in Africa and also has sought the EU’s support in implementing its own (UK) foreign policies in Africa. This reveals the influence that both parties have on policies in Africa, which experts have argued should not be divided, but rather jointly sustained for Africa’s economic progress.What then does Brexit mean for Africa? Brexit will open opportunities for Africa negotiate better trade policies and business relations with the UK – all which have been obstructed over the years by the EU’s trade policies, for example, the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). To put into context, the EU’s CAP as it currently operates subsidizes European agricultural products, meaning that African farmers are at disadvantage and cannot compete at the European market. With Brexit, trade negotiations will be on the table – which apparently will by-pass the EU’s trade policies that have not only been detrimental to African farmers but have historically distorted access for African farmers into the European market.Moreover, Brexit means that the UK will be in direct competition with the EU on many trade policies, including CAP. History has shown that the UK has been pressuring the EU to reform its (EU) trade policies towards Africa, particularly the subsidies to European farmers. Thus, Brexit will offer the UK the opportunity to consolidate its trade relations with African countries, particularly the Commonwealth countries, as opposed to the EU having the exclusive authority to negotiate and decide international trade agreements. This will apparently put the UK in the position to trade freely with Africa – and African countries will be placed on a pedestal to bargain for better deals with both the UK and the EU.Furthermore, Brexit means that the UK will lose significant trade influences in the EU. Given the uncertainties that Brexit brings to the global financial markets, there is likelihood that the UK may lose some existing trade negotiations with African countries. Before Brexit, there were discussions about merging the Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres (BRVM) – which is the bourse for eight African countries that form the West African CFA franc monetary zone – with the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Today, there are many African companies listed on the LSE, as London is seen as the hub of European stock exchange. In the face of post-Brexit shocks and uncertainties, African countries may consider exploring (for those that don’t have) or consolidating (for those that already have) bilateral trade relations with European countries like Germany and France. This will mean that Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which currently ranks among the top ten stock exchanges in the world, may become the new hub of European stock exchange; hence desirable for African companies.\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that African countries need to focus on the opportunities that Brexit presents, rather than jumping on the bandwagon of panic wave. Clearly, regional integration in Africa is still at the infant stage. Brexit has presented African countries with the opportunity to integrate the continent economically and politically. But focus should be on the economic dimension of Africa’s regional integration. Though, Africa is integrated into the global market through the commodity market; however, Africa is still at the bottom end, where it is not optimally utilizing its commodities. Therefore, Africa needs to scale up manufacturing productivity in order to tackle the challenges of job and wealth creation. To do this, Africa needs to promote industrialization through value addition, value process management, technology advancement and scaling up investment in infrastructures. These will help Africa become more competitive in the global market.\nChukwuma is a graduate student of Public Policy and Management at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

A positive trade balance between ourselves and other countries brings in much-needed foreign currency and employment opportunities; a negative trade balance, on the other hand - where we buy more from them than they buy from us - means the opposite.South Africa exports goods valued at R84 billion to Germany, for example, but buys imports of R127bn. This constitutes a healthy trade balance in Germany’s favour. This needs strenuous efforts to create a better balance.The trade relationship with the UK operates in South Africa’s favour. We sell R46bn in goods to the UK, while buying R33bn.One of Brexiteers’ chief arguments for leaving the EU is that it will create new and exciting opportunities for trade over the world. Britain’s Secretary of State for International Trade Dr Liam Fox stated in The Telegraph on June 19 that it was his country’s ambition to become the world’s leading champion of free trade, taking the opportunity provided by its exit from the EU to develop an explicitly pro-trade independent policy framework.He visited Uganda, Ethiopia, Mozambique and South Africa last year, presenting the UK’s trade policy for Africa and stressing his country’s eagerness to open new markets and to develop existing trade relations.Fox said South Africa was a key trading partner to the UK, a long-standing, strong and strategic ally for the UK in Africa and internationally.“As we become an even more outward-looking country, we will continue building on our relationship with South Africa.”UK exports to South Africa increased by 25% in the past decade and South Africa’s exports to the UK increased by more than 5% annually for the past decade, underlining the importance to both of each other’s markets. South Africa is the third biggest trading partner for the UK in the Commonwealth.Fox’s African tour followed a visit to London by Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies, in January last year.Observers were gratified to note that the meetings were a continuation of the ongoing high-level engagement between the UK and South Africa to discuss trade and economic relations and the strengthening of ties while working together to identify trade and investment opportunities for both countries as well as the wider southern Africa and Africa region as the UK prepared to leave the EU.On January 25 last year, the Citizen reported Davies as saying: “As we work to achieve this, South Africa looks forward to discussing how our trade post-Brexit could build on the recently concluded Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU.”Davies was right to underline the EU dimension; after all, the EU is a huge and extremely significant trading partner of this country.But so are the UK and the EU each other’s biggest trading partners and that will continue even after Brexit. There can be no either/or, or even us/or them approach; we all need each other.South Africa (but also the EU and the UK) will need to follow nuanced and sophisticated policies. From our point of view, we should aim first at increasing trade with the EU, closing the trade gap as far as this is possible while recognising that the EU clearly benefits more from trade with South Africa than does South Africa in trading with the EU.At the same time, while trying to preserve our favourable trade balance with the UK, we must take advantage of the Commonwealth ties with the UK to expand trade with that country and make the most of the new opportunities that will arise. There could well be opportunities for taking up some of the slack in post-Brexit trade between the UK and some EU countries.All of this will demand flexibility and fleetness of foot by our Department of Trade and Industry, as well as our diplomats in the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. The departments and ministers Davies and Lindiwe Sisulu will have to co-operate closely with each other, recognising that the Brexit opportunity, with possible radical alterations to the world trade order, comes along only once in a lifetime.If we are to attract vastly increased foreign investments and sell our goods to the world, we must look as though we know what we are doing.Cut out the populist ideology; focus on trade, business and investment. We must be ready to show the available investment opportunities to potential investors and we must produce the goods that we want to sell. We are going to have to become much smarter at business and investment and manufacture than we have been. If we succeed in this, greater prosperity for all our people becomes a possibility.* Douglas Gibson is a former opposition chief whip and a former ambassador to Thailand.** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.The StarNational Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Brexit presents an opportunity of a lifetime for SA","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:31:44.730Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

However, having examined the Chequers agreement ... I have come to the conclusion that it does not respect the referendum result – it is not what people voted for,\" he said.Some in the pro-EU faction have also rejected the plan. Former minister Justine Greening called on Monday for a second referendum to end the stalemate in parliament over the best future relationship with the bloc.May's spokesman said there would be no second referendum under any circumstances, and restated her position that the Chequers plan was the only way to deliver a Brexit that worked in the best interest of the country.Another pro-EU lawmaker Dominic Grieve, who has led previous efforts to get the government to soften its Brexit stance, said the party needed to accept compromises \"or accept that Brexit cannot be implemented and think again about what we are doing\".'MY BREXIT OR NO BREXIT'On Sunday, May attempted to face down would-be eurosceptic rebels by warning that if they sink her premiership then they risk squandering the victory of an EU exit that they have dreamed about for decades.A party meeting last week looked to have snuffed out talk of a confidence motion challenging May's leadership, which would require 48 Conservative members of parliament to initiate, and 159 to win.But, fuelled by criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and anger among grassroots party members, the sentiment against May has gained fresh momentum.A ministerial aide became the ninth party member to resign their post in protest over the Chequers deal. Lawmaker Scott Mann quit on Monday, saying the plan would put him in conflict with his constituents by delivering a \"watered down\" Brexit.The debate is expected to start at 1630 GMT, later than originally planned, with the first votes due around 2000 GMT.The amendments to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill have been proposed by arch-eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg. He said he did not expect the bill, or another bill on trade due to be debated on Tuesday, to be blocked outright by the 650-member parliament.\"I'm sure Theresa May does not want to split the Conservative Party and therefore she will find that the inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it (the Brexit policy) to keep the party united,\" Rees-Mogg said. \"We'll have an idea of the numbers, I suppose, at 10 o'clock on Monday evening.\" National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"UK ministers vote to reveal extent of anger over May's Brexit strategy","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:33:08.987Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

The prime minister thanks Boris for his work.\"Johnson criticised the Brexit blueprint in private but has so far refrained from public comment.Downing Street swiftly appointed eurosceptic housing minister Dominic Raab to Davis's job, and said May was looking forward to working with him to deliver Britain's departure from the EU in March.The resignation of Davis, with a stinging warning that Britain was \"giving too much away too easily\" in Brexit talks, was a blow to May just days after she declared a truce among her warring ministers.- Next move -All eyes are now on the next move by Brexit hardliners in her centre-right Conservative Party.But the appointment of Raab, a leading Brexit supporter, suggests Tory Brexiteers are divided.Davis himself said it would be \"wrong\" if his departure led to a full-fledged rebellion, insisting that \"of course\" May would survive.May will address parliament later to explain her proposal for Britain to adopt EU rules on goods after Brexit, and is also expected to speak to Conservative MPs.The plan was agreed by cabinet ministers during marathon talks on Friday, where even those wanting a clean break from the EU fell into line.The deal meant that for the first time since the vote for Brexit in June 2016, Britain has a detailed proposal to take to Brussels, and still hopes to agree a deal by October.May's spokesman told reporters: \"There was an agreement reached on Friday and we look forward to taking that agreement forward in negotiations.\"He added: \"We believe it will deliver a positive Brexit, that's what we're focused on.\"European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the change of ministers was not a problem and that the EU was ready to negotiate \"24/7\".The EU \"will continue to negotiate in goodwill, bona fide, with Prime Minister May and the UK negotiators in order to reach a deal\", he said.May spoke to Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, EU president Donald Tusk and the leaders of Ireland, Sweden and Malta over the weekend to discuss her plans, and is meeting Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in London later Monday. - 'Reluctant conscript' -In his resignation letter to May late Sunday, Davis warned that on Brexit, \"the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one\".Her plan would \"make the supposed control by parliament illusory rather than real\", and proposals for a \"common rulebook\" on goods \"hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU\".Davis said his job required \"an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript\".Speaking to BBC radio on Monday, he said he hoped Britain would \"resist very strongly any attempt to get any further concessions\".May replied in a letter rejecting \"your characterisation of the policy we agreed\", which she said would see powers currently held by the EU returned to Britain.Davis was appointed after the referendum to head up the newly created Department for Exiting the EU and became the public face of Brexit, leading the British delegation in talks with Brussels.His role had been increasingly overshadowed in recent months as May and her aides took a bigger role, and had reportedly threatened to quit several times as they moved towards closer ties with the EU post-Brexit.Brexit hardliners have welcomed Davis's move, with Conservative MP Peter Bone saying: \"The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.\"The main opposition Labour Party said the government was in \"absolute chaos\".\"It is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy,\" spokesman Keir Starmer said.National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"May on the rocks as foreign, Brexit ministers quit","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:33:33.147Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

The pro-EU Conservative lawmakers want to change the trade bill to force the negotiation of a customs union if attempts to agree a friction-free trade deal with the EU fail.\"When MPs (members of parliament) bring forward amendments, we obviously look at those,\" he told reporters.\"The PM has set out on a number of occasions our position in relation to the customs union, which is that we will be leaving the customs union and she believes that that's what the British people voted for and it is important that we are free to strike independent trade deals around the world.\"But her plan so far has pleased very few, deepening those divisions in her Conservative Party that have so far hampered progress in talks with the EU, and triggering a bitter war of words between its Brexit-supporting and pro-EU factions.\"We can't please everybody. We have to have a compromise position that enables the country to get an agreement with the European Union,\" trade minister Liam Fox told BBC radio.\"It's up now to the EU 27 to determine what sort of relationship they have with us.\"Tuesday's vote will be on the trade bill, which is focused on converting trade deals between the EU and third countries into bilateral deals with Britain. It is a technical bill and was not originally intended to define new trade policy.Pro-EU lawmakers have tabled a change to the wording of the bill to try to force the government to pursue a customs union with the EU if ministers fail to reach an agreement which establishes \"a frictionless free trade area for goods\".Parliament could also consider a government attempt to bring forward its summer break to Thursday from next week, which the government says is logical because there is very little parliamentary business in the remaining days.Any vote on moving the break would take place on Wednesday. Critics say the move is a bid by a government to escape the prospect of more rebellions in the Conservative Party.\"It's nothing more than a shameless attempt to evade scrutiny by a government in absolute disarray,\" said opposition lawmaker Matthew Pennycook, a member of the Labour Party's Brexit policy team. \"There is absolutely no way that I'm voting for it.\" National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"May faces a new Brexit battle in parliament","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:33:52.606Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

I don't think we see it as rude.\"But the comments drew outrage from some British lawmakers and will make for an awkward atmosphere with May when the pair meet at her country retreat of Chequers for a working lunch, followed by a press conference.They also undermine the prime minister as she faces speculation of a leadership challenge from eurosceptics in her Conservative party following the resignations of Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis.Trump, a long-time supporter for Brexit, said he had advised May to leave the EU in a different way but was ignored.\"I would have done it much differently. I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn't agree, she didn't listen to me,\" he told The Sun.\"She wanted to go a different route. I would actually say that she probably went the opposite way. And that is fine. She should negotiate the best way she knows how. But it is too bad what is going on.\"Referring to the Brexit blueprint published by the government on Thursday, which calls for close trading links with the EU after Brexit, Trump said: \"The deal she is striking is a much different deal than the one the people voted on.\"It was not the deal that was in the referendum. I have just been hearing this over the last three days. I know they have had a lot of resignations. So a lot of people don't like it.\"Duncan suggested the president had not seen the detail of the plan when he gave the interview on Wednesday, while also stressing that the much-vaunted special relationship was about much more than Brexit.But Anthony Gardner, who was former president Barack Obama's ambassador to the EU, held nothing back in attacking Trump's attack on May as \"totally unacceptable\" and \"unprecedented\" in the middle of a high-profile visit.\"He is out of control and an embarrassment. He is (a) one-man wrecking machine,\" Gardner tweeted.Trump flew into Britain on Thursday, having already subjected NATO allies in Brussels to a roasting over their levels of defence spending.- 'Kill the deal' -May has insisted that her Brexit plan will allow Britain to strike its own lucrative trade deals with countries like the US after leaving the EU in March next year.She pressed Trump about the deal on Thursday at a gala dinner at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill.Brexit \"creates an opportunity to reach a free trade agreement that creates jobs and growth here in the UK and right across the United States\", she said.But Trump poured cold water on May's offer.\"If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,\" he said.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters Trump was \"thankful for the wonderful welcome\" he received in Britain. \"The president likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with The Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her',\" she said.- Tea with the queen -Trump and May are due to watch a display of military special forces on Friday before their formal talks which will cover Russia, ahead of a summit in Finland on Monday between Trump and President Vladimir Putin.Putin's government is accused by May's of unleashing a deadly nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury. Moscow denies the charge, but May is pressing Trump to raise the issue with Putin. Trump will later Friday take tea with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, before spending the weekend in Scotland on a private visit that will likely take in 18 holes at one of the property magnate's golf courses, where more protesters await him.He will not attend any high-profile events in London but a mass protest is planned in the capital on Friday, where demonstrators will fly a giant balloon next to the British parliament depicting Trump as a nappy-clad baby.The balloon was authorised by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has crossed swords with Trump several times after the president posted factually incorrect messages over a series of terror attacks in Britain in 2017.In his Sun interview, Trump said Khan had done \"a very bad job on terrorism\", which he linked to migration. The mayor defended his record to the BBC.Related TagsNational Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Outrage after Trump crushes May's Brexit strategy","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:34:18.152Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

Two senior ministers resigned in protest shortly afterwards.May is now facing a possible rebellion from Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party who want her to ditch her plan when lawmakers vote on amendments to legislation on the government's post-Brexit customs regime on Monday.However, she has told unhappy lawmakers that they needed to back her or risk there being no Brexit at all.Greening said that with divisions in the Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party over how to proceed with Brexit, there should be another vote, with the public able to choose between May's plans, a \"no-deal\" break with the EU or remaining in the bloc.\"The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people,\" she said. National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latest#FakeNewsAlert: No kidnapping at N1 City MallSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Former education minister calls for second vote on Brexit to end stalemate","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:34:38.311Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

(Getty Images)If the media reports in the UK and American press are anything to go by, before 2014, few outside the UK private sector knew the name Arron Banks — until he and his chums came to be known as the Brexiteers [Bad Boys of Brexit] — of some interest to the US probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the November 2016 US presidential election.Now he is reported by the BBC to be one of the subjects of inquiries by the British Electoral Commission, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office and a UK parliamentary select committee, investigating allegations of Russian interference, fake news, spending irregularities and misuse of private data in the Brexit campaign.Born in 1966, the British businessman started his journey into notoriety when he donated in October 2014, £1-million to the UK Independent Party (Ukip), a Eurosceptic, right-wing and anti-immigrant political party. The Bristol Post reported that Banks was previously a Conservative party donor, but announced he was defecting to Ukip in 2014.\nWhen former Tory leader William Hague claimed he’d never heard of Banks, he announced he was increasing his donation to £1-million.The donation to the group, which had been dismissed by Tories as backward racists, or as former Prime Minister David Cameron put it: “swivel-eyed loons” who could barely win a seat in Parliament, allowed Ukip to not fizzle out and begin a more targeted Brexit campaign. The chubby, moneyed, G\u0026T aficionado has been described by British media as the “leading figure” in various anti-EU campaigns, including Grassroots Out and Leave.EU, as well as the official Vote Leave campaign.Banks’ close relationship with then Ukip leader Nigel Farage quickly made him a key figure in Ukip and the Guardian reported that he was part of the group that president-elect Donald Trump hosted at Trump Tower shortly after his election victory in 2016.The father of five, with a reported net worth of £250-million (as of November 2017) was born in Northwich, Cheshire. The New Statesman said he was raised primarily by his mother as his father ran farms in various African countries. He was expelled from two different schools for “an accumulation of offences”, including the sale of lead, stolen from school buildings and other unspecified “high-spirited bad behaviour”.The Spectator said his second wife Katya — a former gymnast and model whom he married in 2001 — was born in Russia. Like Trump, Banks is a Twitter “super-user”, who often goads anti-Leave campaigners and journalists into twars.It all started with his own disclosure: There has been pointed speculation about Banks’s relationship with Russian officials in the UK since he disclosed in his memoir The Bad Boys of Brexit, that he and his Brexit buddy Andy Wigmore — a former diplomat and businessman — had a “six-hour boozy lunch” with the Russian ambassador in November 2015. But Banks has now been forced to admit the contacts were more extensive than previously stated.Emails leaked to UK newspapers The Observer and the Sunday Times revealed Banks had far deeper contacts with Russian officials than he initially claimed, they said. The emails — Banks alleges — were stolen. Journalists say they obtained them from a whistleblower.The Guardian said the correspondence shows he met the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, three times, rather than once, and that he shared at least one phone number for the Trump transition team with the Russians, and that he was offered a spot in a gold-mining deal in Russia, although it is not clear whether took up the offer. He said he didn’t.Banks and Wigmore also met ambassador Yakovenko that November, when the gold deal was mentioned, and again a year later, three days after visiting Trump Tower. The disclosures also raise questions as to whether he passed on any sensitive political information in those three meetings. He said he did not.The emails from Banks and key associates were collected by journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who ghost-wrote The Bad Boys of Brexit, a diary/memoir of the period leading up to the EU referendum. Oakeshott, described by the Daily Beast as a pro-Brexit journalist is alleged to have held back evidence of links between Russia and the Brexit campaign while playing down so-called conspiracy theories in televised interviews.Oakeshott collected the emails as part of background research at the time.Instead of alerting authorities to what as contained in the emails, Oakeshott kept them under wraps, saying she only realised their significance as she continued working with Banks and planned to publish them at a later date as part of a separate book she had been working on. Oakeshott claims some of her emails were hacked, but this has been denied by others who had obtained them. Where did Banks get the money to become a political donor? openDemocracy said that in January 2015, one estimate of his wealth was £100-million. In November 2017 an estimate of £250-million started making the rounds. Banks reportedly began his career when he was offered a junior job at Lloyd’s of London, a British retail and commercial bank with branches across England and Wales despite having never received a formal tertiary education.openDemocracy said that Banks also owns Eldon Insurance, whose CEO Elizabeth Bilney was in charge at Leave.EU, and where Andy Wigmore is also a director. The company’s profits leapt to £16.7-million for the first half of 2017, which Banks attributes to the business having been transformed by the same artificial intelligence technology used in the Brexit campaign. Banks has stated that he has a controlling interest in a diamond mine in Kimberley, South Africa, and a licence to mine in Lesotho.openDemocracy — an independent global media platform — concluded extensive research into Banks’s financial affairs, saying, “the value of his businesses are materially lower than Banks’ own inflated boasts”. It also questions how he could afford large contributions to the Leave campaign.Banks’ convoluted financial arrangements are partly propped up by companies located in various tax havens, including Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man — where with British businessman Jim Mellon, he owns a bank. In the UK, Companies House records appear to show that Banks has set up 37 different companies using slight variations of his own name. All this makes it hard to ascertain the origins of the money he used to “buy” the Brexit campaign.Banks frequently asserts that he runs an insurance business. However, a report by openDemocracy says he has been prohibited by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority from running his own insurance company after a report from Gibralter’s Financial Services Commission “serious and widespread failings”.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Getty)A week ago, Britain had strict red lines on Brexit, pro-EU lawmakers were “traitors” and the plan for Britain’s future ties with the European Union after leaving the bloc were a jumble of platitudes and overweening ambition.Fast-forward a few days and Brexit hardliners are on the defensive, while the government is showing a willingness to compromise and outlining a more pragmatic vision for a country half-in, half-out of the European Union.“The momentum and the situation call for ruthless realism. Dreaming of a world that had turned out differently is not enough,” former Conservative leader William Hague, an influential voice in the party, wrote in The Daily Telegraph.Prime Minister Theresa May, who campaigned to stay in the European Union in the 2016 referendum, has tried to balance moderates and hardliners in her party ever since coming to power two years ago at a time of political upheaval.She was forced to show humility again after calling an early general election in June last year only to lose her party’s majority after a wooden performance on the campaign trail.A year later, commentators said recent events show she has firmly chosen the moderate side with a plan for Brexit, to be fully detailed on Thursday, that envisages close regulatory alignment with the EU to allow unhindered trade in goods.“Mrs May has recognised that the only pragmatic approach to decoupling from the EU is a softer version of Brexit,” the Financial Times said in an editorial.The plan has unleashed a rebellion by Brexit hardliners who fear it may prevent Britain from concluding free-trade agreements with third countries and effectively turn the country into a “vassal state” or “colony”  of the EU.It prompted the resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Minister David Davis, as well as several other Conservative party figures, but analysts say that May has been able to face down the rebellion so far.In the pro-Conservative Spectator magazine, Brendan O’Neill wrote that there had been “a Remainer coup” — a reference to Johnson’s replacement Jeremy Hunt, who also supported staying in the EU but says he has now changed his mind.“Brexit will be softened, which is to say undermined: turned from a passionate cry for democratic independence into a bureaucratic exercise of pursuing slow-motion semi-divergence from the EU while actually kind of staying in,” O’Neill wrote.A lot will depend on how the proposals are received in Brussels but the initial signs have been encouraging.“If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,” Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told a session of the Irish parliament.“I think perhaps we are now entering into that space,” he said.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at the Western Balkans summit in London on Tuesday, said it was a “good thing” that there was a British proposal on the table.“What we want to do now is to bring the negotiating progress forward,” she said.British ministers have also sounded more conciliatory.Justice Minister David Gauke said on Tuesday that the option of walking away from negotiations advocated by some Brexit hardliners was not “pain-free” and would have “a negative impact on our constituents, on the British public”.“It’s a negotiation.\nThat requires compromise on both sides if we are to reach an agreement,” he told BBC radio.Commentators have also observed a new firmness shown by May in the negotiations and her increasingly overt challenge to the “Brexiteers” to try to take her down.“May seems to have emerged stronger — at least in the short term — from Davis and Johnson’s high profile resignations,” said Constantine Fraser, an analyst at TS Lombard, an economic research consultancy.But Fraser warned of challenges ahead for May, particularly given the loss of parliamentary support from hardliners.“How on earth will May get that through parliament?” he asked, referring to future votes on any Brexit deal.Steve Peers, a professor at the University of Essex, said he believed the Conservative party had in effect split into two groups.“The pragmatists recognise that Brexit forces a trade-off between sovereignty and the economy… The fantasists deny that such a trade-off exists,” he said.“The cabinet now clearly consists of the pragmatists, with the fantasists on the back benches. But time will tell if this can last,” he said.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

I think it’s the wrong thing to do”.May will address Parliament later to explain her proposal for Britain to adopt EU rules on goods after Brexit — an increasingly fragile compromise reached with angry ministers in her own party demanding a clean break with Brussels.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexit campaigner, has been critical of the plan in private but has so far not said anything in public since the cabinet signed up to the proposals after marathon talks on Friday.Jack Blanchard from Politico said: “The first key question is whether this is an isolated incident or the start of a domino effect”.Long-time eurosceptic Davis said he hoped his resignation would put pressure on May to make a stronger stand.“It seems to me we’re giving too much away too easily and that’s a dangerous strategy… Hopefully we will resist very strongly any attempt to get any further concessions” by Brussels, he said.Davis announced he was stepping down in a scathing letter on Sunday.“The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one,” he wrote to May.Friday’s proposal would “make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real”, he added.Davis was particularly critical of the plan for a “common rulebook” to allow free trade in goods, saying this “hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU”.He concluded that his post required “an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript”.May replied in a letter defending her plan for Brexit.“I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed,” she said, asserting that it “will undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels to the United Kingdom”.\nDavis was appointed two years ago to head up the newly created Department for Exiting the European Union after Britain voted to leave the bloc in a referendum.He became the public face of Brexit, leading the British delegation in talks with Brussels, although his role had been increasingly overshadowed in recent months as May and her aides took a bigger role in the negotiating strategy.The 69-year-old had reportedly threatened to quit several times over a perceived lack of firmness in Britain’s negotiating stance but had remained strictly loyal to the prime minister in public.When she speaks to MPs, May is expected to acknowledge there have been “robust views” on Brexit in her government and is also set to announce a replacement for Davis on Monday.Brexit hardliners have welcomed Davis’s move, fuelling turmoil within the party and raising the prospect of a potential leadership battle.Conservative MP Peter Bone said Davis had “done the right thing”, adding: “The PM’s proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.”Ian Lavery, chairman of the main opposition Labour Party, said: “This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.”May’s plan would create a free-trade area with the EU for goods, to protect supply chains in areas such as manufacturing, while maintaining flexibility for Britain’s dominant service sector.It is unclear whether Brussels will accept this, after repeatedly warning Britain it cannot “cherry-pick” bits of its single market.Johnson was widely reported to have described the plan as a “turd” before agreeing to support it. He is due to speak at a Western Balkans summit in London on Monday.© Agence France-PresseGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Stefan Wermuth/Reuters)British Prime Minister Theresa May drew fire from all sides on Monday over her Brexit strategy as a former minister described it as a “fudge” and called for a second EU referendum, and eurosceptics readied a parliamentary challenge.Former education secretary Justine Greening, who opposed Brexit, said May’s plan to follow European Union rules on trade in goods without being able to influence them was “the worst of both worlds”.Noting the deep divisions in government and parliament on the way forward, Greening said the decision must be put to voters — becoming the most senior member of May’s Conservative party to back the idea.“The only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the people,” she wrote in an article in The Times.May has repeatedly ruled out a second referendum, after Britons voted by 52 percent for Brexit in 2016, but Greening’s support for a so-called People’s Vote will give the campaign a huge boost.Her intervention is also another blow for May’s plan for close ties with the EU, which had already come under fire from Conservatives who want a clean break.Two top ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, quit in protest last week followed by a string of junior walkouts, including another on Monday.Eurosceptics will have a chance to show their strength in the House of Commons late Monday by voting on amendments to a bill setting up a new customs regime after Brexit, which would effectively wreck May’s plan.They are not expected to pass, as the opposition Labour party will not support them, but will show how many MPs are prepared to publicly oppose the prime minister.Meanwhile May will also test her plan with the EU this week, with Brexit negotiations due to resume in Brussels on Monday and the other 27 leaders due to hold their first talks on the proposal on Friday.Split the partyThe prime minister this weekend defended her plan, saying there was no alternative that protected trade in goods with the EU and avoided border checks in Ireland.She insisted it would allow Britain to control migration, end the jurisdiction of EU courts and forge its own trade policy — despite US President Donald Trump saying it could “kill” a US-UK trade deal.But eurosceptics believe it keeps Britain too close to the EU, and Davis, the former Brexit secretary, warned in the Financial Times on Monday it would deny the government the “freedom to run our own economy”.“It would be profoundly dangerous to leave the EU but remain subject to regulations made by institutions in which we have no say,” he wrote.In an article in the Mail on Sunday, May urged eurosceptics to keep their “eyes on the prize”, warning: “If we don’t, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.”Pro-Europeans are also unhappy, including with the plan for loose ties with the EU on Britain’s dominant services sector, and former prime minister Tony Blair said it would lead to a “confused outcome”.Some MPs have tabled an amendment to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill, also known as the customs bill, seeking a new customs union with the EU, which May has strongly rejected.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the powerful European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs, warned May’s approach would split her party.He accused the prime minister of never having given up her support for staying in the EU, telling the BBC on Sunday she was “a Remainer who has remained a Remainer”.Rees-Mogg said she still had time to change course, but said the current plan would only go through parliament with the support of opposition votes.“The inevitable consequence of the parliamentary arithmetic is that she will need to change it to keep the party united,” he told BBC television.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

May’s plan is geared to remove the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and proposes the creation of a free trade area with the European Union (EU), in which the UK would abide by a “common rule book” of EU regulations.A Downing Street spokesperson confirmed Johnson’s resignation saying: “This afternoon, the prime minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary.\nHis replacement will be announced shortly. The prime minister thanks Boris for his work.”His resignation follows that of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and his second-in-command at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker. Johnson’s departure has deepened the sense of crisis around May, increasing the chances that she could face a vote of no confidence.The prime minister was due to address her backbench MPs in Westminster at 5.30pm, in an atmosphere that was becoming more unstable. According to the Guardian, Johnson met David Cameron in private before the Chequers summit, where they discussed the controversial customs arrangements May put before ministers. Johnson met the former prime minister on Thursday evening, after a caucus of seven cabinet members gathered at the Foreign Office to discuss their concerns about May’s plans for regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.After the Chequers summit, it emerged that Johnson had referred to attempts to sell the prime minister’s Brexit plan as “polishing a turd”.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(AFP)British Prime Minister Theresa May will publish details Thursday of her long-awaited Brexit blueprint to restart talks with the EU, after facing down a revolt by eurosceptic ministers that could still unseat her.In a policy paper, the government will outline proposals for a free trade area and a “common rule book” with the EU in goods after pressure from businesses to allow cross-border trade to continue as normal.But Britain would still plan to leave the EU single market and customs union and set its own path on the far bigger services sector, hoping to be able to curb EU immigration and strike its own trade deals with third countries.For the City of London the plan would propose “a looser partnership” with the EU rather than original proposals for “mutual recognition” of British and EU rules after Britain leaves the bloc in March, the Financial Times reported.“We’re making sure we’ve got a bespoke relationship with the EU,” Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who was only appointed on Monday after his predecessor David Davis quit in protest over the plan, told BBC radio.“It’s a credible proposal. It’s bold, it’s ambitious but it’s also pragmatic,” he said.The plan has caused outrage among eurosceptic members of May’s Conservative party, and foreign minister Boris Johnson joined Davis in dramatically quitting this week in protest.Their departures, followed by a clutch of junior aides, destabilised May’s government and revived talk of a leadership challenge against her.The prime minister is also likely to face some opposition in Brussels, where officials have repeatedly warned Britain to lower its expectations about how close ties can be.“Of course the EU-27 is open to compromise but not one that can undermine the main pillars of the single market,” an EU official said on condition of anonymity.An EU source said: “We will look at these things constructively, and in a way that is helpful to the prime minister.”May has briefed leaders including EU president Donald Tusk and German chancellor Angela Merkel on her plan and reported a positive response, although they are awaiting the detail.Britain does not have long to argue its case — both sides are aiming for a deal by October, to allow time for its ratification by the British and European parliaments.Failure to agree would see Britain leave the EU without a deal, with the risk of huge economic disruption on both sides of the Channel.The Financial Times has reported that one contingency plan being examined in case of a no-deal Brexit is using barges to help keep the lights on in Northern Ireland in case there is disruption to electricity imports from the Republic of Ireland.Britain voted for Brexit in June 2016, but May has so far been unable to present a common position to Brussels on what she wants because of deep divisions in her government.Amid warnings from businesses that continued uncertainty is risking investment and jobs, and fears time is running out, her cabinet finally agreed on a plan last week.The aim is to keep EU rules on goods to protect complex manufacturing supply chains, using technology to levy its own duties on UK-bound products from outside the bloc, while diverging on services.\n“We need to rise to the challenge and grasp the opportunities” of Brexit, said Raab, adding that the policy represented a “balance”.But Johnson, a leading Brexit campaigner, said following EU rules without being able to alter them risked consigning Britain to the “status of colony”, and said it looked like a “semi-Brexit”.Other eurosceptics who want a clean break with the bloc are also livid, prompting speculation they may launch a confidence vote against May.Brexit-backing MPs, including leading eurosceptic Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, will also seek to force her hand by submitting amendments to a trade bill being debated in the House of Commons next week.Rees-Mogg told AFP his aim was only “to help the government stick to some of its earlier promises”.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

The government will implement what you decide.”The message was crystal clear: This was a historic constitutional moment, a renewal of the social compact underpinning Britain’s institutions, a choice of such significance that it had to be taken directly by the electorate. Forty-two years after Britain joined the Common Market, and 55 years after Harold Macmillan’s controversial first application, it was decision time, a plebiscite to end all the dithering. No wonder the vote gripped the nation like no other in living memory.Equally indisputable, according to both Remain and Leave campaigns, was that withdrawing would entail a rupture, a revolutionary break from the status quo. By the end of the campaign, it was clear that Britain was not talking a few tweaks, or a minor renegotiation of its membership. Positions had evolved and hardened.Fast forward two-and-a-bit years, and the anticlimax is extraordinary. Many Leave voters feel that they were duped, that the referendum was little more than a charade, that Britain’s long and proud democratic journey has come to an end. When the Government pledged to follow instructions, what it really meant was that it would deliver on a Remain vote, seeing it as carte blanche for more integration. A Leave vote, on the other hand, was so clearly preposterous and self-defeating that it could never be enacted. The “realists” called Brexit a mirage, impossible because it was incompatible with the existing technocratic legal order — never realising how inflammatory such statements sounded.Now, many Leave voters are beginning to fear that this promise to implement the referendum was a monumental lie, one of the worst cases of deceit from the political class in modern British history. It was only made on the expectation that it would never be delivered; and we know no preparations were made for a Leave vote, putting Britons on the back foot from day one. Even more grievously, the establishment — most members of parliament, the Confederation of British Industry, most civil servants, the cultural elites, many academics and so on — won’t accept the result. They are refighting the referendum using every tool they have, without a vocal and articulate Leave campaign to oppose them.For a little while after the referendum, these pro-Remain refuseniks were in abeyance, and with the right government, the right attitude and the right cadre of advisers they could have been contained (or even co-opted). The technocratic status quo could have been crushed, and a genuine and workable Brexit forged, by leveraging this country’s huge assets and economic strength.But the original Brexiteers imploded within hours of the result, and the Government that did emerge from the madness turned out to exhibit Suez Crisis levels of incompetence. Prime Minister Theresa May adopted a divided governmental structure that simply wasted time and handed power to the civil service.The staggering intellectual and leadership vacuum since 2016 — and last year’s amateurish general election — allowed the civil service to seize complete control, and pro-Remain MPs to threaten to overturn any meaningful Brexit. There has been no real no-deal planning, as such an outcome was anathema to those in charge.The Chequers plan, which is bound to be adulterated further by European negotiators, looks like it will make it impossible for the UK to enjoy the upsides of leaving, while retaining most of the downsides of membership. True, there is more than one way to leave, and multiple palatable compromises; May’s now-defunct red lines were too rigid. But some compromises are so great that what is left is no longer a true Brexit. It is now nearly certain that whatever deal she “negotiates” will fall into this tragic category.The situation is thus exceptionally grave. For Leave voters and at least some Remainers, this is another Iraq “weapons of mass destruction” moment: A shattering, toxic realisation that their assumptions about their rulers were misplaced. Former prime minister Tony Blair never recovered from going to war on a false prospectus. Trust is central to politics, and its breakdown helps to explain much of the angst and rage of recent years. The financial crisis was a lie of sorts: it broke an implicit promise by the elites that they knew what they were doing. The parliamentary expenses scandal was another.There is a better way. The Government must stop the current, doomed Brexit process, scrap the White Paper and start again from scratch — this time negotiating properly and threatening the EU with severe consequences if it doesn’t cooperate, just as Brussels has been doing with Britain. The December agreement must be torn up: The UK cannot accept the EU’s interpretation of the Irish question or the ridiculous backstop. Britain will need not just a new hardball negotiating approach, but an entirely new, pro-growth strategy to help the economy and companies get through the turbulence. This may mean halting Article 50, or finding another temporary solution to buy time.If none of this happens, if Brexit is killed off, de jure or de facto, Britain will be plunged into a permanent political crisis. The Tory grass roots and the party’s pro-Brexit base will never forgive the leadership’s betrayal, and Labour will lose its working-class support. A Ukip 2.0 will arise, as well as European-style populist and nationalist parties. Swathes of the country — perhaps, after the next recession, a majority — will cry out for a Donald Trump figure.Is that really what May wants her legacy to be?

Yet in real time, these moments that make or break governments — such as Sir Robert Peel’s repeal of the corn laws, which split the Tories for a generation — are more typically the hard-fought climax of processes that follow a circuitous and up-and-down path, with the key decision put off until it is inescapable.The moment of decision for UK Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit is following this pattern too. The route has meandered for nearly two years through negotiations, summits, lawmaking and elections; last week’s English elections will be part of the context too. The climax has been long predicted and frequently postponed. To judge by what Downing Street said this week, as ministers prepared for Wednesday’s cabinet committee on customs arrangements with the EU, it may well be pushed back yet again by a few weeks. Yet the moment is nearing all the same. When it finally arrives it will be bitter and destructive, above all for the Conservative party. But the Brexit terms were always going to have to be faced in some form. That form, it now turns out, will focus on the customs arrangements.Much of the commentary presumes that the outcome remains in serious doubt. Yet it seems increasingly likely that the UK will seek to remain in some form of customs association with the EU. Whether the EU will agree is, however, another matter.May has already grappled with this question twice during the Brexit negotiations. Both times it has come up in the unavoidable context of the Irish border. Both times, in December on the divorce terms with the EU and in March when a transition agreement was made, May signed up to a soft border in Ireland.It is certainly true that the terms of the earlier deals contained significant elements of fudge. It is also true that the UK side still talks about technological solutions that the EU dismisses as fantasy. Nevertheless, unless May now abandons those two earlier agreements and unless the EU takes a much gentler line than it has done, there are only two realistic outcomes for Britain to choose from while avoiding the return of a hard border in Ireland.These outcomes are, first, the UK remaining in some form of continuing customs union with the EU or, second, Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union while Britain leaves it. The latter is opposed by Northern Ireland unionists and May dismissed it as recently as Wednesday when she said at prime minister’s questions that an Irish Sea customs border was something no UK prime minister would agree to. This leaves UK membership of the customs union — or something on similar lines — as still much the most likely outcome of the internal British political argument. Why? Because the EU has shown no interest in, and is under little internal pressure to explore, either of the alternative options being debated by British ministers, and the arithmetic in parliament is tending that way too. In the House of Lords, Tory peers have voted with the opposition parties to demand a continuing customs union. Surely there will be divisions. Some Tories will reject any soft Brexit, although no cabinet Brexiteer has said it is a resignation matter. But the issue need not bring May’s government down. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Euro-sceptic sabre-rattling over the customs issue this week is a bluff she will have to call. In the end and with no small irony, the pivotal issue in Brexit is the same one that in different ways has so haunted British politics for more than two centuries — justice for Ireland. Today, peace and prosperity in Ireland depend upon a soft Brexit for which there is a parliamentary majority. A hard Brexit, with a hard Irish border, is clueless, delinquent and playing with fire.— Guardian News \u0026 Media LtdMartin Kettle is a Guardian columnist. AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedNo-deal Brexit will be a disaster for youthDon’t worry about robots stealing our jobsEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

And what adds to the political drama now enveloping the United Kingdom’s government is that his resignation comes two days after May and her cabinet colleagues reached a tenuous agreement that was supposed to end months of bitter political sniping, backbiting and rivalries to deliver a so-called soft Brexit — if the EU27 and the European Commission agreed.What is clear now is that before any Brexit deal can be reached — and that is supposed to be signed off at an October summit, or a special one which can be called in mid-November at the latest — May’s Conservative party must try and find some degree of unity on what exactly Brexit means.Those on the right of her party favour a so-called ‘hard Brexit’, one that would see the UK leave without any deal with the EU after more than four decades of integration at almost every level. That’s a scenario industry leaders warn puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, but supporters say will allow the UK to reach trade deals as and when it likes.For moderate Conservatives, the ‘soft Brexit’ is preferable, one that keeps many of the ties in place, limits the fallout on the economy, keeps the UK in a common customs area for the free movement of trade, services and goods, but has controls on the free movement of people.At Chequers, the PM’s country retreat, on Friday, May managed to convince her cabinet to back a softer Brexit, a stand that might win approval from the EU who are reluctant to water down any of the four freedoms of trade, services, goods and people, lest others in the EU27 want similar deals in the future, weakening the foundation of the economic, political and social union.Davis’ resignation risks splitting her Conservative party and triggering a vote on her leadership. Under Conservative party rules, 48 Members of Parliament can trigger one by sending letters to its 1922 Committee, and estimates are that about 40 have already done so, some have sent them following her disastrous general election campaign that sees her now relying on 10 MPs from Northern Ireland to govern. What is clear now, however, is that the United Kingdom’s government is more disunited than ever.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedTories better off with May, poll suggestsEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The bill is now a very different piece of legislation to the one launched in the Commons by Brexit Secretary David Davis last September. It was significantly amended in the Commons just before Christmas. Now the Lords have fundamentally transformed it. Members of parliament must therefore decide what to do with the many changes that the Lords have made. It will be the most important few months of parliamentary activity in a generation, perhaps more.If the government and Labour leadership had had their way, the soft Brexit opportunities that now face MPs this summer would probably not have existed at all, or in very constrained ways. Both parties had their own reasons for wanting the bill to go through. Last week, there were some particularly striking government defeats in the Lords. The first, moved by the bishop of Leeds, would keep the UK as a participant in EU agencies such as Europol. The second, moved by the Duke of Wellington no less, removes the government’s preferred Brexit date — March 29, 2019 — from the bill, giving elbow room for a possible agreement to pause or extend the Article 50 withdrawal process.Britain’s MPs will have to vote again, not just on the European Economic Area, but on almost all the pivotal issues that would make the difference between a hard Brexit and a soft one.When the bill went through the Commons last autumn, relatively few of these issues raised large tussles. May’s Brexit strategy is to hold the Tory party together by withdrawing entirely from the EU, while making serious practical compromises to maintain as “frictionless” a relationship as possible with the EU, its institutions, agencies and member states — Ireland above all. Government defeats on crucial questions such as the single market, the customs union or the Irish border would overturn the entire strategy. Yet this is becoming more likely now. May’s strategy worked for her first months as prime minister. But the “lost election” of 2017 and the fundamental differences among Conservative MPs and ministers over Brexit issues that cannot be permanently postponed mean its lifetime is now almost spent. Labour’s caution on Brexit shows little sign of changing, but there are enormous temptations for Jeremy Corbyn to overcome his anti-EU instincts in order to humiliate the government on at least some of the Lords amendments.This explains why, even as she runs out of road on Brexit, May still acts as if she is hoping that something unexpected will turn up. There is now talk at Westminster of the Brexit bill votes being delayed to the autumn, partly to avoid embarrassing Commons defeats affecting the June EU summit at which the future relationship will be discussed — and partly because Conservative rebels on both sides of the argument might be more disciplined if the talks appear to be nearing a successful conclusion.It is hard to imagine that the Tory party’s Commons discipline is about to collapse on every single issue that the Lords have put on the table. Nevertheless, the Tory soft Brexiters seem a bit bolder now. That is partly because their numbers are gently creeping up — and also because, in the end, these moderate Tories feel they have to fight harder now if they are to prevent their party from collapsing even further to the United Kingdom Independence Party right.The “Crazy” jibe last week acts as a recruiting sergeant for the soft Brexiters. The coming weeks and months may be their moment. A hung parliament gives them the means. The slide to the right gives them the motive. And now the Lords have given them their opportunity. It will be a hot political summer.— Guardian News \u0026 Media LtdMartin Kettle is a Guardian columnist.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedNo-deal Brexit will be a disaster for youthDon’t worry about robots stealing our jobsEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

We will take back control of our borders, with an end to free movementIn the two years since the EU referendum, the government I lead has worked ceaselessly towards achieving a Brexit deal that honours the result of that vote and puts the United Kingdom on track for a prosperous future.We have already made considerable progress, with agreement on protecting the rights of EU citizens living here in the UK and British citizens living in the EU, on an implementation period to give businesses time to prepare, and on a fair financial settlement. However, on crucial aspects of our future relationship with the EU our discussions have reached an impasse. Neither of the models that the EU has put on the table would work for Britain.A standard free trade agreement, with Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and single market, would shatter the constitutional integrity of our United Kingdom. Some combination of European Economic Area (EEA) and customs union membership would not deliver on the referendum result. It would mean continued free movement, ongoing annual payments of vast sums, the obligation to enact the entirety of EU law and no ability to strike our own trade deals. Neither of these options is acceptable.A “no deal” scenario is not our intended outcome either. It risks people’s livelihoods and threatens the Union. But as a responsible government, we have to prepare for all eventualities — and that is precisely what I asked the Cabinet to do at Chequers.Instead, we have an alternative proposal, which the Cabinet agreed the detailed shape of on Friday. Later this week, a White Paper will spell it out in full. It is a coherent package that my party can unite behind, that should command a majority in Parliament and inspire the confidence of the whole British people, however they voted two years ago. I am convinced that this is in the best interests of the UK and the EU.It honours the referendum result. The UK will leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. We will take back control of our borders, with an end to free movement. We will take back control of our money, with no more vast annual sums paid to the EU. We will take back control of our laws, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom.An up-front commitment to maintain a common rule book for goods and agricultural products, underpinned by our determination to maintain high standards in consumer and employment rights and environmental standards, will enable the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods. This common rule book, and a new business-friendly customs model, will ensure both frictionless trade with the EU and the freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. A parliamentary lock on all new rules and regulations will restore sovereignty and democratic accountability, ensuring that the men and women you elect will make the laws we all live by.Crucially, this deal will strengthen the whole United Kingdom. There will be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and no new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Leaving the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy will give us the freedom to design new policies that work for our rural and coastal communities.Building on our shared values, we propose continued close cooperation on security matters to keep our people safe. At the same time, we will have a fully independent foreign and defence policy, working closely with our EU and Nato allies.This proposal is fully in accordance with the principles I set out in my Lancaster House, Florence, Munich and Mansion House speeches. It also honours the commitments made in the last election manifesto upon which every Conservative MP stood. But our proposal of a common rule book to underpin our trading relationship represents a significant evolution of the UK’s negotiating position.I judge this to be necessary in order to move the negotiations forward. The Cabinet agreed with that judgement and this is now the formal collective position of Her Majesty’s Government. On that basis, the UK’s negotiating team will now engage with the EU on it at pace.Now is the time to set aside, once and for all, the divisions of the past and to unite as one nation to achieve agreement with the EU. Achieving a Brexit deal that honours the referendum result and sets us on a prosperous course is my duty and my mission.

Almost half think it would be bad for Britain.The new Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday the prime minister was still trying to persuade members of the cabinet that her strategy was the best way forward.Raab also warned that Britain could refuse to pay a 39 billion pound (Dh187 billion) divorce bill to the EU if it does not get a trade deal - a threat used before by ministers.Speaking to the BBC, Raab refused to deny reports the government is planning to stockpile food or use a section of motorway in England as a lorry park to deal with increased border checks if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.Asked about a story in The Sun newspaper that the government was planning to stockpile processed food, Raab initially replied \"no\" and then added: \"That kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media, to the extent that the public pay attention to it, I think is unhelpful.\" The possibility of leaving without a trade deal has increased with May facing rebellions from different factions in her party. She only narrowly won a series of votes on Brexit in parliament last week.The Sunday Times poll found voters are increasingly polarised, with growing numbers of people alienated from the two main political parties.Thirty-eight per cent of people would vote for a new right-wing party that is committed to Brexit, while almost a quarter would support an explicitly far-right anti-immigrant, anti-Islam party, the poll found.Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage and US President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon are in discussions about forming a new right-wing movement, according to The Sunday Times.Half of voters would support remaining in the EU if there were a second referendum, the poll found, a level of support found in other surveys this year.YouGov spoke to 1,668 adults in Britain on July 19 and 20, according to The Sunday Times, which did not provide other details about how the poll was conducted. The fiercely-guarded ‘Quantico’ star has finally revealed a huge rock, believed to be a gift from fiance Nick JonasMax - 23 °CMin - 12 °CKerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Apparently, the secret was knowing the sequence in when and how to move the different interconnecting coloured squares at just the right time.Some Rubik wizards could even do it behind their backs. Me? I’d consider it a major victory if I could get even just one face of the six with all 16 squares the same colour. And from what I can remember, it wasn’t often that indeed happened.I think that the Eurocrats in the Berlaymont Building in Brussels must feel as if they’re dealing with a Rubik’s cube in which all the pieces keep moving and nothing stays in place when it comes to Britain and Brexit. If they were surgeons, it’s be like trying to do open heart surgery which the patient is still awake.As someone remarked recently, it’d be a lot easier if the Brits knew exactly what it meant when they voted No, and what they were voting No to. With nine months left before some sort of a Brexit deal is supposed to happen — or just four months before some sort of a Brexit deal is supposed to be concluded, no one in Brussels, and much less so in Britain where they voted for it, has any idea of what it all means.It’s a mess. And with the European Union leaders and the Commission meeting in three weeks time, the two biggest hurdles of all — in this whole befuddled, bemuddled, bemused, confused, convoluted behemoth of a dystopian divorce from Europe — still sit on the table. The customs union and the Irish border.These are the pair of elephants in the cabinet room in 10 Downing Street, and no one sees them. Or more rightly, they’re not looking at them and are hoping they will just somehow go away. As it sits right now, and with those two political pachyderms squatting there, there is no Brexit deal. And it’s about time the Brits realised that.Michel Barnier, the former French minister and the man responsible for leading the EU in the Brexit talks, uses the language of the British playing “hide and seek” and claims that the UK’s Prime Minister, Theresa May, is attempting to pin the blame for any damaging consequences due to a lack of progress on Brussels.Sir Ivan Rogers, a sage and savvy squire who was Whitehall’s former chief diplomat at the EU, puts it another, equally disparaging but more revealing way — and in words that pull few diplomatic punches — Britain is being misled by the “buccaneering blather” of hard Brexiters rather than facing the reality that a customs deal had to be done.Sir Ivan can say these things now that he is retired, is no longer constrained by the niceties of his office, nor by control from political masters. He was both the chief Brussels adviser to David Cameron and Theresa May — and if she needs to get a Brexit deal done, done quickly, and done with a framework that will cause minimal damage to the British economy, Sir Ivan should be brought back in, sat at the table, and get on with getting the whole thing done and dusted.But May this June day is in no position to make such a decision — she sits at the head of a cabinet so riven by divides that no move is better than any.Damage to the economy?Last week, the Bank of England issued a report that the Brexit mess so far had cost every family in the UK some £900 (Dh4,390) so far — the cost of a week’s all-inclusive family holiday in Spain or Greece. Nope, the British tabloid press that so adamantly backs Brexit didn’t run those headlines: “Brexit horror! Bo Jo’s follies steals your jollies”, or “No Place in the Sun for Eu!”And we’re just getting started.Sir Ivan has said he despairs of “people professing themselves free traders who have only a hazy understanding about multilateral, regional and bilateral free trade deals, have never negotiated one — but know it’s straightforward, once one has left the EU.”And just who are those deals going to be made with? The US?In the late 1980s and early 1990s, trade negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the US sat down and talked long and hard on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). It’s worked well for decades, so well indeed that the likes of the Big Three automakers of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler had seamless operations across the borders. Parts came from plants in Mexico, were shipped north, and the Big Three liked that Canada’s health care system lowered labour costs — US health insurance premiums are prohibitive.There were more cars made in Ontario in some quarters, for example, than there were south across the border in Michigan. It, Nafta, worked well until someone in Washington decided otherwise at the drop of a tweet. And that’s who hardline Brexiters would like to do business with.As far as Sir Ivan is concerned, if only May would drop some of her red lines, there’s a decent deal to be done.He sees some sort of quasi-single market deal, paying something for it, living with the European Court of Justice and its jurisprudence and jurisdiction in goods for the Brits. In return, the EU might give a little when it comes to disapplying the freedom of movement principle. That’s the same one that allows thousands of east Europeans to work cleaning cars and flipping burgers in Britain while sending high-value euros back to their low-value home nations.Here’s the thing too. Remember all those refugees that three summers ago trudged from the Middle East and made their way to Munich and Mannheim, Paris and Prague? The EU leadership found a politically expedient way to end that whole freedom of movement thing. So, let’s not talk about principles then.If Britain wants a deal done, it has little time to make that happen. But for that to happen, the prime minister has to lead. And that hasn’t happened yet.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedPalestinians, you’ve got mailAsian-Americans need more moviesSome Australian officials have weak passwordsTrump wants Pompeo to study killing of farmersEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Her assertion of “government sovereignty” has reached crisis point, and it is imperative it is rejected by both the Lords and Commons in the crucial debates on Brexit. The double-crossing of Dominic Grieve —British Conservative politician — brings the issue to a head.By his and other accounts, May promised Grieve there would be a legal commitment to a “meaningful” parliamentary vote in the event of a “no deal” Brexit. On this basis he was persuaded to withdraw his amendment to the EU withdrawal bill, which the government feared it would lose. A day later Grieve secured an acceptable legal text from ministers, which was suddenly withdrawn and replaced by a provision that in case of “no deal” the House of Commons would be allowed only to debate a “take note” motion, which would be unamendable and meaningless if the government chose to ignore it.This assertion of government sovereignty follows a now established pattern. May’s first step on the Brexit road was her implacable refusal to submit the EU withdrawal notice for parliamentary approval, claiming the royal prerogative. It took a path-breaking decision by the supreme court to force her into parliament. Worried that she might not have a majority to carry hard Brexit through the Commons, the prime minister then called an election, expecting a landslide victory. Instead she got a hung parliament, and has no credible mandate for anything the Commons does not authorise.The reason May is now seeking to solidify “government sovereignty” in advance of the key Brexit votes in parliament this autumn is precisely because she is so weak in parliament. That is all the more reason not to grant her powers that no head of government has assumed since Charles I and James II in the 17th century.If May’s proposal is carried, the House of Commons would be in a weaker position than if there were no advance legal provision whatsoever for what to do in the event of “no deal”. By constitutional practice, the Commons would be free to vote on whatever resolutions it thinks fit under normal circumstances, whereas May is seeking the Commons’ agreement to deprive itself of any meaningful vote in advance. To try to make an argument, ministers are objecting to the word “instruction” in the Grieve amendment. David Davis, once a poster boy for civil liberties, now asserts that it is wrong for the Commons to seek to “instruct” the government, and this might give rise to the unacceptable situation of MPs taking over the Brexit negotiations from ministers.Ever the conservative, Grieve is proposing only that parliament should give instructions in the event that the government fails to negotiate any deal at all. As he rightly says, this would be a national emergency, and since — unless May’s new doctrine is accepted — parliament is sovereign, it has a duty as much as a right to say what should then happen. It would then be for the government to “execute” the will of parliament — which is why it is called the executive. It is absolutely legal and appropriate for the House of Commons to give instructions to the government in such circumstances. There are countless cases where it has done so over the centuries, and it is the essence of our parliamentary democracy.Military actionDavis himself has form on this issue. In 2012, in the argument over Britain’s EU budget contribution, he supported a successful backbench amendment calling on the government to “strengthen its stance” to reduce it. That’s an instruction. More explicit still are recent Commons’ resolutions on military action, an area where until the Iraq war MPs had often deferred to ministers. To assuage discontent among MPs, former prime minister Tony Blair went to war in 2003 only after the Commons explicitly resolved that it “supports the decision of the Government that the UK should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq”. “ It is right that the House debate this issue and pass judgement,” Blair said.The next time the Commons was asked to authorise military action — by David Cameron, against Syria in 2013 — it refused to do so, rejecting an explicit motion to “agree to military action”. When the motion was lost, Cameron immediately told MPs: “I believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons. It is very clear that the House does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the government will act accordingly.”Tellingly, when May undertook limited military strikes against Al Assad’s regime earlier this year, she refused to summon parliament or table a resolution. Those opposed to such bypassing of parliament didn’t press the issue because the air strikes had already happened by the time parliament met to debate them, and May indicated there would be no more. In retrospect, MPs would have been wise to register their strong objections, whether for or against the action, since it only encouraged May to approach Brexit in the same high-handed manner.The irony is that Brexit is supposed to be about parliament “taking back control”. That fiction is being steadily exposed for what is in reality a power grab by the right wing of the Conservative party, which is seeking to suppress the party’s moderate and pragmatic MPs — who, May and Davis know, would be able to command a majority in the Commons if matters went to a vote.That is why it is crucial that both houses of parliament support the Grieve amendment this week. We should do so in the tradition of the Bill of Rights 1689, which declared resistance to James II’s attempt to subvert the “laws and liberties” of this kingdom by assuming a power of suspending of laws without consent of parliament.— Guardian News \u0026 Media LtdAndrew Adonis is a Labour peer and former UK transport secretary. AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedA new model of human securityThe power games in Syrian conflictDaesh leader Al Baghdadi in new audio messageThousands of Russian troops fought in SyriaEllie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...Haj operators have raised prices atrociously, leaving many p ...Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayUAE public holidays 2018Kerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: An uncertain futureListen: Fazza calls Dubai PoliceTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsPriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaWhere to watch Eid fireworks in UAEGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

And that would be the worst of both worlds, with World Trade Organisation rules coming into effect, with British manufacturers and businesses facing higher costs, delays, and uncertainties, and with the EU27 trying to reach practical agreements on a whole range of day-to-day and strategic matters with an estranged and isolated administration in London.For the past year, Brexit negotiations have been hamstrung by a series of red lines laid down by the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, and she too has been working against a political backdrop largely of her own making — a divided cabinet, a weakened and compromised position in parliament, and a Conservative party beholden to a hard Brexit element that has led the debate from the onset.Her attempts to reach a consensus position at Chequers earlier this month was an abject failure, exposing the Brexit divisions within her cabinet and threatening her leadership. Indeed, she had adopted positions anew that have been rejected months ago by Brussels, and she is back-pedalling on an agreed backstop position on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south. Given all of this, should we be surprised that the no-deal Brexit seems a very real probability? Not at all, which is why it would be now prudent for all parties to prepare fully for this worst outcome.

Grinning from ear to ear he looked me in the eye and said that I was going to truly fall in love with Mexico.We stood and watched the procession a little longer. Huge effigies of soldiers, teachers, dancers and miscellaneously androgynous life forms twirled in front of us to the irresistible pounding of the band. Everything from sousaphone to clarinet joined in to contribute to the atmosphere.Young couples smiled and danced, heels clicking over the cobblestones that characterize Oaxaca’s central thoroughfare, while fireworks burned haphazardly over the vast legions of floral clad dancers awash with the smell of agave and perfume.An utterly unique atmosphere and one of unbridled joy, happiness and optimism.The cause for the celebration seemed twofold. The imminent festival of the Guelaguetza gives the dancers an opportunity to practice before the main event, while the town’s high school students use this as a stage to enjoy their recent graduation.Soon-to-be-law students and communications majors mingle with the dancers and musicians who have been plying their trade for years.Manuel was wrong, for he had thought that Mexico would eventually get the better of me and I would then come to love it. This idea that Mexico is a nation that has to be worked at to be loved is certainly the preserve of a media bias and something that Manuel, a worker in the tourist industry, surely has to convince the steadily increasing numbers of tourists that visit the country every year.Now I have only been in the country a few days, so the cynical among you will cry that the honeymoon period of the tourist surely masks any negative sentiment. This couldn’t be further from the truth.Negative sentiment is evident. The sea of tents that festoon the downtown area provide an all too real reminder that all is not well in Oaxaca, despite the festivities. The zone around the principal square, the zócalo, is bleeding out, a tourist industry hamstrung by the actions of politicians many miles away.However, in the wake of Brexit and the imminent success of the Trump campaign, visitors from both the U.S. or Britain would be hard pressed to say that politics weren’t affecting their daily lives. It just seems we are happier to brush the whole issue under the carpet. Demonstrations rather than celebrations remain the preserve of modern media.I asked Manuel what he thought and he didn’t really seem so fussed. Though it was a big shame for the hotels in the region, he explained that this kind of thing was far from atypical. He and his friends simply stayed positive and got on with things. Poquito a poco.The Scottish school syllabus has little time for the history of Mexico and so, knowing next to nothing, I spent the morning at the local museum of Oaxacan culture, where I learned about the incredible political, social and religious turmoil that has proved the coke in the forge of modern Mexico.So it seems that adversity and overcoming it is a facet of many aspects of Mexican life. Far from being a hindrance, it has helped shape Mexico into the diverse and wonderful country that we can enjoy today.Of course there are issues that make the prospective tourist feel uncomfortable and opt for a a holiday in Europe or a “safer” location but I would implore anyone to visit this utterly unique country.The real Mexico isn’t on either Fox News or the BBC, it’s here in downtown Oaxaca as the eternal drums and brass bands head off southwards, past tent city and into the cool night.Come and see it for yourselves; although the tents may still be here, so will the joy.Louis Rive is a Scottish writer and editor who is spending some time traveling in Mexico.The city of Oaxaca is ready to celebrate its 86th Guelaguetza and offer visitors a unique opportunity to get to know the state’s culture and diversity.A musical recording that blends the popular Mexican song Cielito Lindo with a famous South Korean folk song celebrates the growing friendship between the two countries.Gerry Smith knows books and ‘Bola’ Domene knows music.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7e8fbd6dba1b08b5a8e2ec"},"url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/as-trade-talks-loom-us-halts-avocados/","content":"Amidst steadily growing worries over the future of Mexico’s trade with the United States comes an incident on the border that some might think is a presage of things to come. But what will Americans say if there’s no guacamole to go with their Super Bowl nachos?Five trucks carrying a shipment of 100 tonnes of Jalisco avocados were stopped last Wednesday at the Mexico-U.S. border and rejected by American authorities.The director of the avocado producers’ association of Jalisco was surprised by the decision issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), as producers in the state had been working alongside that agency for months to meet its technical requirements.“We are unaware of what happened,” said Ignacio Gómez, adding that it was not clear if the decision was related to President Donald Trump’s assuming office on Friday.The Rural Development Secretariat of Jalisco stated that last May the USDA officially certified the avocado production of several municipalities, granting them an export-grade qualification.However, more administrative barriers went up, further delaying permission for the fruit’s export. But further negotiations cleared the way.The endorsement in their pocket, producers from the municipality of Zapotlán el Grande shipped the first batch of avocados aboard five trucks with an official ceremony last Monday where representatives of the federal government and the USDA were in attendance.Two days later, the shipment was stopped at the border in Reynosa, Tamaulipas due to “setbacks in the implementation of the required protocols,” as the Rural Development Secretariat of Jalisco explained it.On Friday producers decided to redirect part of the shipment to Canada and the remainder to the domestic market.Apparently, the agreement between both countries was that Jalisco avocados would be granted access to the U.S. if that country’s potatoes could enter the domestic market in return.That part of the agreement “got complicated” earlier last week, triggering the USDA’s rejection of the Jalisco avocados, said the state’s Rural Development Secretary.“This will pass simply as an awkward moment,” said Héctor Padilla, who acknowledged the anger of producers but urged that everyone involved must move on because “in the end what we’re looking for is to open up an important market for the producers and business people of the state.”“. . . Negotiations with the United States are always variable, never comfortable. This is not the first incident, but we’ll get nowhere by fighting,” he said.“We are not in a hurry to sell, it isn’t that we have no markets. We are interested in entering [the U.S.] because it is a market that we want to win . . . Our fruit is currently sold in 18 or 19 countries.”“The fruit of Jalisco is of the best quality, thus we’re in no emergency situation. It’s no big deal if they do not open their doors now,” asserted Padilla.But what if they do close the doors on both Jalisco and Michoacán avocados? A columnist with the Spanish newspaper El Independiente suggested on Friday that the avocado was a key in the debate over imposing tariffs on Mexican products.American voters, wrote Marta García Aller, might not take kindly to an import tax that causes avocado prices to skyrocket and makes Super Bowl guacamole a luxury.“In a time of post-truth politics, it’s the most unexpected things that raise awareness among the population,” she wrote. “And the stomach is one of those things.”García cited the rising price of Marmite in the United Kingdom and the fact that it became a symbol over the fear of inflation that Brexit (the U.K.’s exit from the European Union) would cause. Comparing Marmite (“a peculiarly British spread,” wrote García, being kind) to avocados is a bit of a stretch, but perhaps the analogy is valid.“Should Trump renegotiate NAFTA,” the columnist concluded, “not even something as American as the Super Bowl might be safe.”Source: Milenio (sp), El Informante (sp), El Independiente (sp)Mexican avocados are rapidly gaining popularity in China: sales in the first half of the year were greater than they were in all of 2017.The economy secretary said today that the three NAFTA partners need to show flexibility to reach an updated trade agreement.Mexico has publicly accepted for the first time the US proposal to include set minimum wages for the automotive industry as part of a new agreement.Violence in Mexico is largely fueled by the illegal entry of weapons from the United States, says Interior Secretary Alfonso Navarrete Prida.Residents of a Oaxaca community rebelled this week and locked up the mayor on suspicion of corruption.It is one good piece of news this week in a security situation that has steadily worsened for three years or more.Mexico’s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party allowed itself to be “seduced by power,” its new leader said in a scathing critique of its election loss.The school year isn’t three days old and teachers in Oaxaca are going on strike, this time over a requirement that teachers in training must study English.The federal Security, Energy and Environment Agency has shut down a gas well located near an area where at least 30 manatees have been found dead.The man proposed to be Mexico’s next  security secretary has admitted he favors the legalization of marijuana for recreational and medical use.Security reforms are likely to take much longer than anticipated and even implemented swiftly they are unlikely to directly improve the situation.Someone enjoyed free electrical service for several years by stealing the meter from a derelict property.The blush of youth, coupled with a significant surge of hormones, eclipsed whatever little judgment they may have possessed on that fateful night.A generations-old tradition of making beautiful bags from maguey fibers lives on in isolated villages in the mountains of Chiapas.The sanctuary is located in La Manzanilla, covers some 264 hectares and has a population of 400 to 500 American crocodiles.Mesquite is widely known as a tree but its beans are also the source of a highly nutritious flour that is gaining popularity as a superfood.THE STORY: \nCancelling airport project would cost 170 billion pesos; binding vote plannedSend this to a friend","header":"As trade talks loom, US halts avocados","parent_keyword":"brexit","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T18:43:08.365Z"},"time":"\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday, August 23, 2018"}

Here’s everything you need to know in a five minute guide.Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has testified before US senators over the mishandling of users' data. \n\nZuckerberg apologised over the data breach, saying it was a mistake to believe Cambridge Analytica when they said they deleted the data they improperly harvested. YOU’VE seen it in the news, you’ve heard it in cafes, you’ve probably even read about it on Facebook itself. The world’s largest social network is under fire for “improperly sharing” users’ personal information, which was then used to influence election results.But the scandal, which is now stretching into its fourth week, can be tricky to fully comprehend.Even some US senators demonstrated a misunderstanding of the issues involved in Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach while questioning CEO Mark Zuckerberg today.We’ve compiled a list of common questions — and their answers — to make sure you’re fully informed.BODY LANGUAGE: What Zuckerberg revealed during testimonyTIMELINE: How Facebook became a trainwreckANALYSIS: The simple question that broke Facebook CEOWhat sparked this scandal?In 2013, Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz that he launched on Facebook. About 300,000 users signed up for it, and agreed to give its creator access to their information. But Dr Kogan also harvested information from users’ entire network of friends without their permission, which enabled him to see details from as many as 87 million users.What information was taken from users?The app gathered a host of information from users, including their gender, location, political and religious views, their private messages, what websites they’d liked, and any publicly available information on their social media profile. Facebook says “in most cases” the friends of people using the app had their “public profile, page likes, birthday, and current city” scraped by Dr Kogan’s app.How was personal information used?Dr Kogan, though his company Global Science Research, sold Facebook users’ information to the political data firm Cambridge Analytica. It used the information to create an exacting personality prediction tool, and to create highly specific advertisements designed to influence individual voters. The information was allegedly used in the 2016 US election as part of Donald Trump’s campaign.Did Facebook know about the data breach?Yes. Facebook discovered Cambridge Analytica had purchased users’ information in 2015. It banned the app responsible and asked Dr Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete it. Mr Zuckerberg now says Facebook’s failure to warn users their personal details had been exploited was a “mistake,” as was failing to check the information had been destroyed.What is Cambridge Analytica?Cambridge Analytica is a firm that, in its words, “uses data to change audience behaviour” and combines “the precision of data analytics with the insights of behavioural psychology” to individually target voters. It was funded by Robert Mercer, a hedge fund billionaire and Trump supporter.How can I tell if my information was taken?Facebook says 311,127 Australians had their information harvested as part of this scandal, and it will issue a message on its users’ Newsfeeds to indicate whether they were directly affected. You can also check your account now by visiting this tool.Can I find out which of my friends used this dodgy app?Unfortunately, while Facebook will confirm whether one of your friends used the app, it won’t tell you which one. You’ll have to conduct your own investigation.What do I do if my information was taken?There’s little you can do. Cambridge Analytica says it deleted users’ data, and Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office has raided its offices to verify its claim. Facebook has also promised an extensive audit of the company. Everyone should, however, check their Facebook privacy settings to ensure they’re not sharing more information than is comfortable.Will Facebook be punished?It’s too early to tell. Mr Zuckerberg will appear before the US Congress over two days, and many senators have discussed imposing regulations on Facebook and other social networks to prevent future data leaks. Investigations into Facebook’s behaviour have also been launched by the US Federal Trade Commission, by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and in United Kingdom, Indonesia, Nigeria, and several countries within Europe.Will I have to pay for Facebook in future?Facebook makes tens of billions of dollars by using your information to sell advertisements. If you stopped sharing information with Facebook, it would no longer have a way to make money. As Mr Zuckerberg told Congress, “in order not to run ads at all, we would still need some sort of business model,” and that would involve charging people to use Facebook privately. There’s currently no plan in place for this premium model.Will Facebook really change?Facebook has made changes already. Mr Zuckerberg says it will share less of users’ information with third parties in future, and is investigating apps with access to large amounts of user information. It will also belatedly tell people if their information has been taken, and has simplified privacy setting menus. It’s yet to be seen whether the social network will make substantial, lasting changes, however.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Mr Zuckerberg told the committee that his own personal data ended up in the hands of a third party after an app creator breached Facebook's developer terms and conditions. (AAP VIDEO/Supplied/NBC News)THE suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy at the centre of a scandal over the use of Facebook data, has cancelled an appearance before British MPs, the chairman of a parliamentary committee says. Alexander Nix had been due to testify on Wednesday.“His legal representation has said that he’s now not able to give evidence to the committee tomorrow, as a consequence of him having been served an information notice, and being subject to a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office,” Damian Collins, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said at a session of the committee. “We do not accept Mr Nix’s reason for not appearing in a public session before the Committee,” he added in an emailed statement.“There is therefore no legal reason why Mr Nix cannot appear.”Mr Collins said he was considering a formal summons for Mr Nix, and he hoped to provide an update on a date for a new hearing early next week.Cambridge Analytica was created by wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer and was previously run by Steve Bannon, who went on to become White House chief strategist. The data company received $5.9 million from Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.The firm had its London office searched by British law enforcement officers last month.A UK court granted the search warrant in March to search Cambridge Analytica after news reports that the company used data acquired from 87 million Americans’ Facebook profiles for political messaging campaigns. The investigation is part of a broader look at whether personal data was taken improperly.Despite Mr Nix not appearing, former Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser did give testimony.She said there was a range of personality quizzes designed to acquire personal data, such as Aleksander Kogan’s This is Your Digital Life app.“The Kogan/GSR datasets and questionnaires were not the only Facebook-connected questionnaires and datasets which Cambridge Analytica used,” Ms Kaiser told the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.“I am aware in a general sense of a wide range of surveys which were done by CA or its partners, usually with a Facebook login — for example, the ‘sex compass’ quiz,” she said.“I do not know the specifics of these surveys or how the data was acquired or processed.“But I believe it is almost certain that the number of Facebook users whose data was compromised through routes similar to that used by Kogan is much greater than 87 million; and that both Cambridge Analytica and other unconnected companies and campaigns were involved in these activities,” she revealed.Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced two days of intense questioning about the data leak to Cambridge Analytica.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Joe Hildebrand looks at Cambridge Analytica and their influence on campaign outcomes.THE truly terrifying thing about the Facebook data breach scandal isn’t how smart Cambridge Analytica is. It’s how dumb we are.Like many Australians, I watched the Four Corners broadcast of the undercover sting operation that brought the so-called “data analysis” firm undone and I was deeply disappointed.Not by the complete absence of any ethics or morals but by how utterly pissweak they were. If these were the top brains of the mystery miracle-workers who made Donald Trump the President of the United States then he should have been even easier to beat than I previously thought. And that is something I thought a lot.Everything these trench-coated tryhards – seriously, did they think they were starring in All The President’s Men? – promised to their clichéd sub-continental client was campaign strategy 101. It was as if they had just borrowed “Election Winning For Dummies” from their local library. Still, that tome was clearly unavailable when Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager dropped by.Here’s one bombshell: Elections are won by appealing to people’s emotions, not to reason. Well no #$%^ing shit Sherlock. That’s why political parties cover leaflets with “Stop the boats!” and “Make America Great Again!” instead of printing out the last fiscal year’s budget papers.Here’s another: You can win the election without winning the popular vote by targeting voters in certain areas. Again, hold the #$%^ing phone. In Australia we call these mystical places “marginal seats”. In America they are called “swing states”, although to be fair these lands are so remote and fantastical that Hillary Clinton never set foot in one.But it’s far more sophisticated than that. Did you know that in elections, sometimes third-party groups push the agenda of a political party? Yeah, I know! As Cambridge Analytica earnestly explains to our man on the scene:“Sometimes you can use proxy organisations who are already there. You feed them. They are civil society organisations… Charities or activist groups, and we use them – feed them the material and they do the work.”No sh*t guys. They’re called GetUp!Of course in America – God bless her democratic heart – these things are called Super PACs, “political action committees” that are set up to receive and spend shitloads of money to promote a political agenda but at arm’s length from any particular candidate so as to bypass campaign funding restrictions. And these bodies are so secret that everyone with even a passing interest in US politics has been screaming publicly about them for years.And here’s another one ye olde electione campaigners may not have heard of: A few years ago, some smartarse invented this thing called “the internet”. Thankfully Cambridge Analytica is here to explain it:“We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape. And so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands but with no branding – so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”Congratulations guys! You just invented the #qanda Twitter feed.Seriously, even the undercover reporter who pretended to hire Cambridge Analytica should ask for his money back.So in short, we are talking about a computer that can determine the core issues of key voters in critical electorates and then target messages to appeal to those voters.Well knock me down with a feather. The Australian Labor Party had one of those machines for years. They called it “Sam Dastyari”.The real scandal here isn’t that Cambridge Analytica figured out how to do this, but that the Democrats forgot how to do it.The real question to ask when the comparison is made between the fabled 40,000 votes that got Trump over the line compared to the more than three million extra votes that Hillary Clinton secured isn’t: “How the #$%^ did Trump win?” It’s: “How the #$%^ did Hillary lose?”Was it a surprise to the Democratic Party that US Presidential elections are determined by swing states and not the popular vote? Or that you can lose the popular vote and still win the presidency as has happened many times before – INCLUDING THE LAST TIME THE REPUBLICANS WON FROM OPPOSITION?Was it a surprise that if you don’t do any press conferences, hang out with celebrities instead of steelworkers and cast your opponent’s would-be voters as “deplorables” that it might turn them against you?Was it a surprise that if your entire campaign brand is a demand that voters grant a leader her destiny instead of reaping their rewards, that they must pledge “I’m With Her” instead of her pledging “What I’ll Do For You”, that maybe those voters would think: “Hang on, what’s in it for me?”There is a reason that Cambridge Analytica was so effective in the 2016 election campaign, and it wasn’t because they were so good. It was because the Clinton campaign was so abysmally bad. And I say this as a Democratic supporter.Indeed, much of the “No fair!” shrieking in the wake of the Cambridge revelations is as illuminating as it is pathetic. Every time the Democrats cry foul play they are admitting that a crude and rudimentary computer program is better at selling a political message than they are.Ultimately Cambridge’s greatest political insight was to keep bleating the message “Crooked Hillary”. If the Clinton campaign couldn’t see that coming they should’ve gone to Specsavers.Meanwhile in Australia we are as dumb as ever too. Our own “bloodstream of the internet” needs no infiltration to corrupt it. The dominant online political forum has for years been the #qanda stream for that once mighty show, yet it now less resembles a pack of political wolves than a pack of sheep to the slaughter.Increasingly it seems that the most moronic and palpably false claims pass for fact on the show and in the flood of endorsement that follows.One glaring example was when discussion about missile strikes on Syria quickly and predictably turned to outrage about Australia’s offshore detention of boatpeople.It should be well known to anyone with even a cursory understanding of this issue that the number of Syrian asylum seekers in detention is minuscule. In fact, it was by virtue of stopping the boats – whose passengers were almost all from other places – that the Australian government was able to free up places for more Syrian refugees and grant an extra 12,000 dedicated Syrian and Iraqi places on top of the regular intake.In other words, the issues of refugee intake from Syria and refugee intake from maritime arrivals are not just completely different – they are diametrically opposed. It is only by rejecting random maritime arrivals that Australia has been able to resettle more Syrian refugees.Argue the merits of this policy by all means, but to confuse the two as being the same thing when in fact they are in direct conflict is staggeringly ignorant. Yet in what is supposed to be our nation’s premier forum for political debate not one person was apparently even aware of this, let alone able to argue against it.And of course the online response was even more moronic, vomiting up false and nonsensical facts that could have been instantly disabused by a two-second Google search.Even this is too much trouble for many, hence the alarming trend of social media users demanding that other social media users send them links to substantiate whatever it is they are saying because they are too lazy to type a word in a search bar.And then undergraduate deadshits like Cambridge Analytica come along and press on our brains like half-rotten melons and we complain that they’re controlling our thoughts. Seriously, give me a #$%^ing break.The golden rule of relationships is that when someone says “It’s not you, it’s me” then it really is you. And so it is with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook and all the other nefarious forces out there that we blame for changing our behaviour and manipulating our minds. Sooner or later we have to ask: How easily can our minds be manipulated? Honestly, how dumb are we?Then maybe we will have the guts to face the most terrifying truth of all: It’s not them, it’s us.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Data breaches are concerning both in their potential for damage and frequency, but there will be plenty of organisations breathing a sigh of relief that fingers are pointed at Facebook right now, relieved that their own scandals are being overlooked or undiscovered.In reality, Facebook is just the tip of the data theft iceberg.The harsh truth is that our technology-filled lives are leaving us open to security risks at practically every turn. It’s so widespread that the 2017 Annual Cybercrime Report (published by Cybersecurity Ventures) predicted that by 2021 cyber crime damages will cost the world roughly $6 trillion annually. It seems if you participate in modern life, with all of its perks, you could be targeted at every point in your day.YOU WAKE UP AND CHECK YOUR PHONEIf a hacker is able to call your network provider and have your number transferred to a device within their control, they can reset the passwords on every account that uses the phone number as a security backup. Accounts that recommend this for security include Google, Twitter and Facebook. Virtual currency users have been targeted, but almost anyone with valuable emails or other digital files could fall victim to theft or blackmail.YOU GRAB A RIDE TO WORKUber was criticised last year for covering up a cyber breach which saw the names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers of 57 million users around the world, end up in the hands of hackers. They paid a ransom to have the data deleted. While no financial information was stolen, Uber was quick to insist they were going to “change the way they do business” to avoid a repeat attack.YOU CONNECT TO THE WI-FI AT YOUR LOCAL CAFECoffee with a free side of Wi-Fi might seem like a no-brainer. Especially when travelling and trying to avoid roaming charges. The reality is it’s all too easy for hackers to eavesdrop or hijack communications over a public Wi-Fi network. Some go a step further and create their own network with an almost identical name to the legitimate cafe or hotel hotspot, so you unwittingly log on to the hacked one.YOU CHARGE YOUR DEVICE AT A MEETINGA public USB charging station can be a welcome sight as you cling to those final few per cent, but plug in your device and you could be at risk of so-called “juice jacking”. If the outlet itself has been hacked, your data could be collected while you sit blissfully unaware. Email, text messages, photos and contacts, the lot.YOU DO A BIT OF ONLINE SHOPPING AT LUNCHTIMEData thieves go where the money is and with e-commerce booming, you better believe hackers aren’t far behind. Each time we shop, we’re putting our trust in systems we hope are secure enough to protect our personal data. However according to law firm RPC, the numbers of online shops hit by serious losses of customer data doubled in the UK from 2016 to 2017. Last week Sears Holdings, which operates Sears and Kmart, became the latest retailer to be caught in a data breach, announcing that the credit card information for up to 100,000 customers may have been exposed by a third-party service provider.You get the idea.The good news is that with every exposure, consumers are becoming more aware and ultimately safer. With increasing transparency between companies and their customers trust can be rebuilt. Ultimately, Facebook is not the enemy here. These are teething problems in a digital landscape that has developed at breakneck speed; legislation and best practice are still playing catch-up.These conversations push the agenda forward and companies like Facebook will undoubtedly play an integral part in finding a solution. Developments in fingerprint and facial recognition technology are already promising to reduce the threat, but for the here and now, take these preventive steps to keep your data safe.WHAT TO DO TO KEEP YOURSELF AS SAFE AS POSSIBLEInstall and update security softwareAnnoying but necessary, don’t ignore those pop-ups recommending updates on your device. They give you the best security protection.Carry your own USB cableBe prepared with a trusted cable, power adaptor or portable battery pack and you won’t have to resort to insecure charging options.Create a strong passwordWe don’t want to sound like your dad, but one of the most common ways that hackers break in to devices is by simply guessing passwords.Check your URL closelyWhen browsing publicly look out for the “https” and padlock icon in the address bar which indicates your connection is secure.Aaron Brooks is the co-founder of Vamp, a content and influencer marketing platform.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

The latest scandal around Facebook won’t make you feel any better.Social media giant Facebook is deploying a digital forensics firm to look into how a consultancy linked to the campaign of US President Donald Trump managed to access the private data of more than 50 millions users.EVER paranoid that you’re being “watched” on social media? The latest drama surrounding Facebook probably won’t help lessen those feelings.The social media giant is currently embroiled in the largest data scandal of its history, following allegations that Cambridge Analytica tapped the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million people without their permission.The story was broken by The Guardian over the weekend, who reported the data may have been used to influence the outcome of the United States election in 2016.WHAT IS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA?Cambridge Analytica is a British data analysis firm that offers services to businesses and groups wanting to “change audience behaviour”.The firm, which is owned by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, says it can analyse consumer data — including social media and its own polling — in order to target people with marketing material.It worked for both President Donald Trump’s election campaign, and the campaign of Republican Senator Ted Cruz.OK, SO WHAT’S THE SCANDAL?Over the weekend, The Guardian revealed that the personal data of 50 million Facebook profiles was illegally harvested by Cambridge Analytica.It all started in 2015, when a Cambridge psychology professor named Aleksandr Kogan created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife”.The app was a personality quiz, described by Dr Kogan as “a research app used by psychologists”.His company Global Science Research had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica.Around 270,000 Facebook users signed up, and were paid to take personality tests which would be stored by the company.But here’s where things get dicey: the app also collected the information of the users’ Facebook friends, who — unless they had already signed up to the app — did not consent to having their personal information stored.This was revealed by Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower and analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica.“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” he told The Guardian. “And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”The app relied on its users consenting on behalf of all their friends — or at least, those whose privacy settings were to set to allow sharing with a friend’s app — to receive “more limited information”.The information was reportedly used to map out the behaviour of voters in the lead-up to the 2016 election, as well as the Brexit campaign earlier that year.The reports suggest over 50 million people had their data harvested without their permission.HOW DID THE FIRM RESPOND?Cambridge Analytica denied any wrongdoing, claiming it fully complied with Facebook’s term of service.The firm claimed allegations that it obtained and used Facebook data were false, and said none of it was used in the 2016 presidential election.The Trump campaign has also denied any wrongdoing, saying it never used Cambridge Analytica’s data. “The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,” it said in a statement.The app was removed by Facebook in 2015, and the firm reportedly assured the social media network that it had deleted all the data.But according to the New York Times, copies of the data are still available online.WHY IS FACEBOOK COPPING CRITICISM?Facebook has come under pressure to be more transparent about how its users’ data is or potentially can be used by third-party companies.Critics say the scandal highlights its ongoing problem to grasp how its platform is handled by others.The social media giant had known since 2015 that the information had been harvested but did nothing to protect its users, according to reports.The network attempted to suggest it was deceived, and that those involved shouldn’t have lied about deleting the data.In a series of now-deleted tweets, Facebook’s chief security officer Alex Stamos said Dr Kogan “lied to those users and he lied to Facebook about what he was using the data for”.Here are @alexstamos now deleted tweets on the app Cambridge Analytica used to harvest millions of Facebook users' data. pic.twitter.com/jPwRHUyW1wIn a blog post, Facebook said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.”Politicians and critics from both the US and Britain slammed the network following the reports.British legislator Damian Collins accused Facebook of misleading officials by downplaying the risk of users’ data being shared without their consent.He said Facebook has “consistently understated” the risk of data leaks and gave misleading answers to the committee.“Someone has to take responsibility for this,” he told the Associated Press. “It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.”US Senator Jeff Flake told CNN: “This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data. And the privacy violations there are significant. So, the question is, who knew it? When did they know it? How long did this go on? And what happens to that data now?”At the same time, the social media network faces ongoing criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda, with an investigation still underway to determine whether “fake news” and Russian hacking influenced the 2016 election outcome.— with APNews Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

And it all started with these dirty tricks.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned for almost 10 hours by senators and representatives over the company's privacy policies. Here are some of the important moments. Photo: EPA/AFPFACEBOOK is currently embroiled in the biggest scandal of its time. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to face intense scrutiny, users around the world don’t know whether or not they can trust the social media giant with their data again.As many as 87 million Facebook users — including 300,000 Australians — may have had their private information siphoned from their accounts.At the heart of this scandal sits Cambridge Analytica, a British data analysis firm that offers services to businesses and groups wanting to “change audience behaviour”.The firm is best known for its work with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016.But what Facebook users didn’t know was that the firm was collecting information on millions of users who did not consent to having their personal information stored.ABC’s Four Corners segment on Monday night looked back on how the scandal unfolded, and how seemingly easily campaigns can be manipulated in the age of the internet.HIDDEN CAMERAS REVEAL DODGY DEALINGSBritain’s Channel 4 News exposed Cambridge Analytica’s alleged dodgy practices in a series of meetings filmed at London hotels between November and January.An undercover reporter posed as a fixer for a wealthy Sri Lankan client seeking election, and asked the company to explain how it influences election outcomes.In the hidden camera footage, played by Four Corners, the company boasts of its work for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.“We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy,” said its chief executive Alexander Nix.He described the company’s dodgy practice methods for undermining opponents in the past, including “sending some girls around to the candidate’s house”, or staging a bribe, secretly filming it and posting that on the internet.He also described how the company could create proxy organisations to publish negative material about opposition candidates on social media, which reached millions of people on different platforms.“Sometimes you can use proxy organisations who are already there. You feed them. They are civil society organisations.. Charities or activist groups, and we use them – feed them the material and they do the work.“We just put information into the bloodstream to the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape. And so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands but with no branding – so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”In a separate exchange, Nix said the company made itself untraceable using a self-destructing email system.“No-one knows we have it, and secondly we set our… emails with a self-destruct timer… So you send them and after they’ve been read, two hours later, they disappear. There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.”Mark Turnbull, the company’s managing director, describes how they have to sway people’s minds without them knowing it’s propaganda:“We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again … like a remote control. It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda’, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’, the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing. After the allegations came out, Nix said the scenarios they described in the hidden footage were hypothetical.“In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our ‘client’ from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,” Nix said in a release. “I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honeytraps’, and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.”THE WHISTLEBLOWER WHO EXPOSED THE COMPANY“If you don’t ask questions, you won’t get an answer that you don’t like.”This is how Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie described the climate at his former workplace, when the data analysis company’s dodgy dealings became apparent.“Everyone knew we were wading into a grey area,” he said while speaking with Channel 4, in the interview aired by Four Corners.“If we look at what Cambridge Analytica does online, it’s coercive. People don’t know that it’s being done to them.“Computers are better at understanding who you are as a person than even your coworkers or your friends.”He essentially described an information war, with you - the social media user - as the primary target.Wylie was driving that war. “I was instrumental. I was at the heart of it,” he said.Wylie explained that the data analysis company was able to get a dramatically insightful reading of a person’s habits and emotions through their social media activity.“On social media, you curate yourself,” he said. “You put so much information about who you are in one single place. So whenever you go and you like something, you are giving me a clue as to who you are as a person.“All of this can be captured very easily and run through an algorithm that learns who you are. When you go to work, right, your co-workers only see one side of you. Your friends only see one side of you.“But a computer sees all kinds of sides of you. And so we can get better than human-level accuracy at predicting your behaviour.”He said the company was so effective because people had no idea they were potentially being brainwashed based on their own data.“There is a lack of awareness. It is coercive. People... If I am studying you and I have enough information about you, because you’ve curated your entire self online and I capture that, I can anticipate what are your mental vulnerabilities, what cognitive biases might you display in certain situations... and I can exploit that.”He accused the company of inventing fabrications with its political messaging, saying the masterminds “knowingly misrepresent the truth in such a way that is conducive to their objective”.“I was there. We worked on all kinds of experiments about what would... what would lead a person from A to B.”Wylie readily admitted to being a hypocrite in all this, given he was instrumental to it.“It weighs on me that I played a pivotal role in setting a company that has done a lot of harm to the democratic process in a lot of countries,” he said. “But I was naive. I made a big mistake.”WHAT NEXT?The data scandal has shined a new spotlight on data and privacy in the digital world.Zuckerberg even admitted last week that his own data had been improperly shared with the company, although he did not go into detail.While taking questions from senators over the scandal last week, Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was committed to winning back its users’ trust.Under new rules, companies will need explicit consent from users to share their data with third parties and people will have the right to know what personal information is stored about them and to ask for it to be deleted.The question — and perhaps one of Facebook’s biggest concerns now — is whether it’s a case of too little, too late.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has outlined additional steps the social network will take to protect user data, after conceding his company 'made mistakes' in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. \n\nBreaking his silence after days of brutal global coverage, he described the situation as a breach of trust. \n\nFacebook's crisis unfolded after a whistleblower revealed shadowy data firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly accessed information on Facebook users to build detailed profiles on American voters for Donald Trump's US presidential campaign.  MARK Zuckerberg has finally broken his silence over the Cambridge Analytica scandal but there was something missing from his public statement. The Facebook boss went into detail about how the current company crisis unfolded and what it has done to prevent third party developers from improperly farming out the data they collect from Facebook users. But after days of silence the statement “rings hollow,” critics said.There was no apology, no mention of answering the calls to front regulators and no mention of democracy.He wrote of “what happened” instead of “what we did,” leaving Facebook one step removed from responsibility.The social media mogul described the details which led to 50 million users having their data improperly obtained and exploited in an attempt to sway democratic elections.Dr Aleksandr Kogan was the University of Cambridge researcher who initially collected the data for scientific purposes and later sold it off to the shadowy analytics firm.“This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” Mr Zuckerberg wrote. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.”Politicians in the US and Europe are calling for him to face questions in Parliament in the wake of the revelations, and Australian regulators have previously expressed a similar desire. But Mr Zuckerberg made no indications whether he will accept any such invitations.Technology journalist David Kirkpatrick and author of T he Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that is Connecting the World was among the people calling for the 33-year-old billionaire to do more.“It’s good you’ve written something, but taking questions from the press in person would begin — just begin — to rebuild the toxic decline in trust this incident and all the other recent data lapses have engendered,” he replied to Mr Zuckerberg’s post.“In my opinion you should not hide behind a Facebook post when you lead a company with the data of 2.2 billion people that many of us now fear is jeopardising democracy at a global scale. It’s sad to have to write it this way, but so it is.”Mr Zuckerberg responded, saying he was set to appear on CNN later today, an interview that went to air at midday AEST.“I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I’m responsible for what happens on our platform,” he wrote in his post.But the public and many in the media were quick to point out that the post lacked a certain level of contrition, steering well clear of an apology.However, it’s probably naive to expect an earnest mia culpa from Mr Zuckerberg because Facebook is working exactly like it’s supposed to.“This is exactly Facebook’s business model,” as Chester Wisniewski, a senior security analyst at Sophos pointed out this week.“Except they want to be the ones doing the analytics and making all the money.”THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOMCambridge Analytica’s client list included Donald Trump’s general-election campaign and has also been linked to the Leave vote in the Brexit campaign.The company’s CEO was secretly filmed bragging about how his data-mining firm helped elect the current US president, although the Trump campaign has completely denied the claims.While the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, Mr Zuckerberg made no mention of the data’s alleged use by the Trump campaign or no mention of the democratic process at all — a glaring omission that has rankled some commentators.Mr Zuckerberg has previously tried to downplay the company’s impact on democratic elections in public, despite it being a sales pitch behind closed doors. The company’s website even hosted a public page boasting about its ability to influence elections. The web page was quietly removed by Facebook earlier this month.In November 2016, Mr Zuckerberg largely dismissed the impact of fake news which spread on Facebook during the presidential election.“Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” he said.THE FIX IS INIn his first public statement, the Facebook boss gave a detailed account of events that led to the current scandal starting with how Facebook previously allowed users to share their friends’ profiles and information with third party apps as far back as 2007 — a change that was all but repealed in 2014.Third-party app developers can now only collect your name, profile photo and email address, Mr Zuckerberg said.Facebook will also remove developers’ access to your data if you haven’t used the app in three months.“We want to make sure you understand which apps you’ve allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you’ve used and an easy way to revoke those apps’ permissions to your data,” he wrote.ZUCKERBERG ‘HAPPY’ FOR FACEBOOK REGULATIONIn an interview with CNN that aired early this afternoon, the Facebook CEO said he would be happy to testify in front of the US congress and would welcome regulation around advertising revenue on social media.When asked if he was willing to answer the call to testify in front of US lawmakers he said: “The short answer is I’m happy to if it’s the right thing to do.”“What we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge,” he said. “If that’s me, then I am happy to go.”Although Facebook employs a small army of lawyers and lobbyists on Capitol Hill, the Facebook CEO himself has never testified before a congressional committee.In perhaps the most interesting moment of the interview, Mr Zuckerberg also threw his support behind more stringent regulation of advertising on platforms like Facebook.“I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” he said. “There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.”After being criticised for not apologising in his earlier statement, Mr Zuckerberg took the opportunity to do so in the TV interview.“This was a major breach of trust, and I’m really sorry that this happened,” he said. “We have a basic responsibility to protect peoples’ data.”News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

The request comes amid allegations that a data mining firm based in the UK used information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election.The company, Cambridge Analytica, has denied wrongdoing.However, the firm’s board of directions has announced that it suspended CEO Alexander Nix pending an independent investigation of his actions. Nix made comments to an undercover reporter for Britain’s Channel 4 News about various unsavoury services Cambridge Analytica provided its clients.“In the view of the board, Mr Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” the board said in a statement posted on the firm’s website.LAWMAKERS ‘MISLED’Facebook also drew continued criticism for its alleged inaction to protect users’ privacy. Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of the UK parliamentary media committee, Damian Collins, said his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data and that Facebook officials “have been misleading to the committee.”“It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,” Collins wrote in a note addressed directly to Zuckerberg. “Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to ‘fixing’ Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.”The request to appear comes as Britain’s information commissioner said she was using all her legal powers to investigate the social media giant and Cambridge Analytica over the alleged misuse of data.INVESTIGATIONS HAMPEREDCommissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s servers. She has also asked Facebook to cease in its efforts to pursue its own audit of Cambridge Analytica’s data use.“Our advice to Facebook is to back away and let us go in and do our work,” she said.Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the UK investigation. However, Denham gave the firm a deadline to produce the information she requested — and it failed to meet it, her office said.Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorised way, adding that the data provisions act requires platforms like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data.PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFAREChris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.The firm found itself in further allegations of wrongdoing. Britain’s Channel 4 used an undercover investigation to record Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, saying that the company could use unorthodox methods to wage successful political campaigns for clients.He said the company could “send some girls” around to a rival candidate’s house, suggesting that girls from Ukraine are beautiful and effective in this role. He also said the company could “offer a large amount of money” to a rival candidate and have the whole exchange recorded so it could be posted on the internet to show that the candidate was corrupt.Nix says in a statement on the company’s website that he deeply regrets his role in the meeting and has apologised to staff.‘MISUNDERSTOOD’“I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,” he said. “I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honeytraps’, and nor does it use untrue material for any purposes.”Nix told the BBC the Channel 4 sting was “intended to embarrass us”.“We see this as a co-ordinated attack by the media that’s been going on for very, very many months in order to damage the company that had some involvement with the election of Donald Trump,” he said.The data harvesting used by Cambridge Analytica has also triggered calls for further investigation from the European Union, as well as federal and state officials in the United States.US STATES DEMAND ACTIONThe top prosecutors in Massachusetts and New York have sent a letter to Facebook demanding the social media giant protect its users’ private information.Massachusetts Attorney-General Maura Healey and New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman launched a joint investigation after reports that British data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica captured information from 50 million Facebook users without their consent.The firm is tied to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.Healey says residents in her state “deserve answers immediately” from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about what data was shared and how the incident allowed to happen. Her office says it has been in touch with Facebook about the investigation.Schneiderman says that if the company violated New York law “we will hold them accountable.”A group of consumer-advocacy organisations is also pressing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook’s role in the of personal data breach.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Campaign for Commercial Free Childhood and 10 other groups are urging the FTC to investigate whether Facebook violated an agreement Facebook signed with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances.The move comes after Bloomberg first reported the FTC could already be investigating. The FTC hasn’t confirmed the investigation but said it takes “any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.” Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman says the company would be willing to speak with federal regulators about the issue.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

The microblogging network admitted to selling users’ data to Dr Aleksandr Kogan following an internal review, but refused to reveal how much money it received for the information.Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of using social media data to influence the 2016 US election, denied it had used the tweets harvested by Dr Kogan, but data scientists claimed they could have played a role in creating a more complete picture of Facebook users for targeted political advertising.MORE: Facebook’s concern for young girls is laughable MORE: David Campbell’s love/hate relationship with FacebookTwitter confirmed its relationship with Dr Kogan’s firm Global Science Research yesterday, revealing it allowed the firm to harvest “a random sample of public tweets for a five-month period from December 2014 to April 2015”.But, in a statement, the company claimed it was not the same sort of data breach that affected Facebook because the tweets had been knowingly shared publicly.“Based on the recent reports, we conducted our own internal review and did not find any access to private data about people who use Twitter,” the company said.“Unlike many other services, Twitter is public by its nature. People come to Twitter to speak publicly, and public tweets are viewable and searchable by anyone.”Twitter regularly sells this public data to research and commercial organisations, which can use the public tweets to analyse customer service, public sentiment, or reactions to certain events.The company raised more than $119 million from this practice in the first three months of the year, and more than $440 million last year.It’s not yet clear how Dr Kogan’s company GSR used information gathered from Twitter, and whether it was sold like private details gathered from as many as 87 million Facebook users around the same period.But Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used the Facebook data to influence elections, denied it had used Twitter information from Dr Kogan.“Cambridge Analytica has never received Twitter data from GSR orAleksandr Kogan, and has never done any work with GSR on Twitter data,” the company said.“GSR was only ever a contractor to Cambridge Analytica and we understand it did work for many other companies.”Regardless, Twitter will no longer allow Cambridge Analytica to book advertisements on its platform because it has “a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices,” though the company will still be allowed to use its Twitter account.News Pty Limited Copyright © 2018.

The company, which consulted for Trump during the campaign, was rocked by reports from the New York Times and Britain's Observer that it had improperly acquired data from Facebook users - prompting Facebook to ban the firm from its platform and British authorities to demand an explanation. But Cambridge Analytica may be an issue not only for Americans and Britons. The firm claims to have worked in a wide range of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Malaysia and Mexico, and politicians in several of them are calling for investigations of the company's work. That list comes directly from the company's representatives, who were recently filmed by an undercover reporter from Britain's Channel 4 News. The journalist presented himself as a potential client, a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family eager to increase its political influence. During meetings over four months, Cambridge Analytica employees touted their work worldwide. Although criticism of Cambridge Analytica focus on its alleged use of data harvested from social media sites, the firm's chief executive, Alexander Nix, appeared to condone using bribes and sexual blackmail to help swing elections. \"Please don't pay too much attention to what I'm saying,\" Nix said over drinks with Channel 4's reporter at a West London hotel. \"I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done.\" Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013, but it is affiliated with an older company called SCL Group, an established British firm that has operated since 1993. According to its website, SCL Group has \"conducted behavioural change programmes in over 60 countries,\" describing itself as a service that provides data, analytics and strategy to \"governments and military organisations worldwide.\" SCL Group formed Cambridge Analytica five years ago to participate in American politics; the company is partly owned by Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund manager and billionaire. But the company's website lists offices in Malaysia and Brazil along with those the United States and Britain, and its activities extend far beyond US borders. KENYA Cambridge Analytica's alleged role in last year's chaotic Kenyan elections already has come under scrutiny. Last year, the firm refused to confirm to Kenyan reporters what role it was playing there, and its website refers only to its work in data analysis and surveys during the 2013 election cycle. But in Channel 4's undercover footage, Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, said the company \"ran\" Kenyatta's campaigns in 2013 and 2017. \"We have re-branded the entire party twice, rewritten their manifesto, done two rounds of 50,000 surveys,\" Turnbull said, later adding that the firm had been involved in \"just about every element of his campaign.\" Kenyatta won the August election, the result of which was contested by the opposition and then annulled by Kenya's Supreme Court. Kenyatta then won the October revote after his challenger, Raila Odinga, refused to participate. As in previous years, protests and violence broke out around the elections. At least 92 Kenyans died. Last year's elections were especially noteworthy for the use of social-media-friendly attack ads, a powerful new medium in the country. Privacy International, a London-registered charity, found that an American digital media company called Harris Media LLC had helped created these online campaigns for Kenyatta. Like Cambridge Analytica, Harris Media worked on the Trump campaign in 2016, and the Texas-based firm also has worked for far-right groups such as Alternative for Germany in Europe. Kenyan opposition leaders are now calling for an inquiry into Cambridge Analytica's involvement in Kenyan politics, and other nations are likely to follow suit regarding their own elections. MALAYSIA Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has denied claims that his government worked with Cambridge Analytica, instead accusing his rival Mahathir Mohamad's son of using its services. AUSTRALIA Australian political parties also have denied using the firm, although a former minister responsible for cybersecurity told SBS that he had met Nix and other Cambridge Analytica representatives at a \"private dinner.\" INDIA In India, there has been renewed scrutiny of SCL Group's 2010 work in an assembly election in the state of Bihar. The Hindustan Times also reported that Cambridge Analytica and its Indian partner have been in talks with both the governing Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Indian National Congress ahead of national elections next year. The full extent of such work is unknown. In footage from Channel 4, Turnbull suggested that Cambridge Analytica had used \"a different organiSation to run a very, very successful project in an eastern European country,\" adding that it had \"ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out and produced really, really good material.\" The country was not named. Nix pushed back against Channel 4's report over the weekend, saying that his talk of bribery and other underhanded tactics captured on video were \"ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\" designed to get the measure of a potential client. But broader global scrutiny of the company's work is now inevitable - and companies such as Facebook, which helped provide Cambridge Analytica with troves of data about voters worldwide, could face a reckoning, as well.","header":" Analysis: Cambridge Analytica's reach went far beyond the US elections  ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:00:22.182Z"},"time":"Friday, 24 August 2018"}

The Guardian said this morning that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL was starting insolvency proceedings. \"The company is immediately ceasing all operations and the boards have applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP to act as the independent administrator for Cambridge Analytica,\" the company said in a statement obtained by the Guardian. Cambridge Analytica denied any wrongdoing and blamed negative media attention for its closure. A total of 87 million people around the world, including 64,000 Kiwis, had their data compromised in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The personality quiz app thisisyourdigitallife, developed by University of Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan, collected data about people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, without their authorisation. Kogan then gave the harvested data to Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used it to target Facebook users with political propaganda in the 2016 United States general election. Fallout from the scandal led to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appearing before US Congress to discuss the issue of user privacy. The issue has had repercussions beyond Facebook, with other social media companies updating their privacy agreements in the aftermath of the scandal.","header":" Disgraced data firm Cambridge Analytica is shutting down  ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:00:41.777Z"},"time":"Friday, 24 August 2018"}

And he imagined that Facebook, whose user profiles were part of that effort, could be a partner in helping to exhume this painful truth and perhaps embrace some changes to its privacy policy. But instead of a joint announcement, Christopher Wylie awoke at the weekend in London, where he lives, to the news that Facebook had published a blog post announcing the suspensions of him, his former employer and one other person for allegedly mishandling Facebook data in an incident that happened in 2014 and had been known to Facebook for more than a year. That explosive moment last weekend turned Wylie, 28, into an unlikely foil to one of the tech industry's most powerful and lucrative companies. The onetime student of fashion trends with pink hair and a stubborn streak has delivered revelations that have triggered government investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, sent Facebook's stock price plunging and pushed long-simmering privacy concerns to a boil. \"I didn't set out to attack Facebook. Facebook has just been incredibly uncooperative,\" Wylie said. \"It hasn't respected the role of the media and scrutiny and embraced this scrutiny and worked to improve itself.\" What happened instead, he said, was an \"own goal\" by Facebook. In hours of interviews with the Washington Post this week, Wylie traced his work for the data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, his growing misgivings before he quit in 2014 and his shock and horror when the company's most famous client, Donald Trump, won the presidency nearly two years later. He also described previously unreported contact with Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, in the northern spring of 2015. Lewandowski denied any contact. And Wylie shared his suspicion - though unconfirmed - that data collected and used by Cambridge Analytica may have fallen into Russian hands. But Wylie spoke with particular passion about his own feelings of guilt for helping to develop an advanced new form of political targeting that was used by people whose conservative politics are the opposite of his own. Some say that Wylie is a flawed whistleblower, that he never should have helped collect data on tens of millions of Facebook users and should not have waited years to publicly reveal his misgivings about working for Cambridge Analytica. But he says he's trying to make matters right by speaking out now. \"I literally left a ticking time bomb,\" Wylie said in his lawyer's London office. \"I didn't quite appreciate that I had done that. And then it blew up.\" Wylie, a Canadian citizen, moved to London in 2010 and started to work in 2013 for SCL Group, which he said conducted \"information operations\" around the world and also worked in campaigns, especially in African nations. As research director, Wylie helped that company give birth to Cambridge Analytica as \"an American brand\" that would focus on US politics with at least US$10 million from billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer. The Cambridge Analytica office was in the posh Mayfair neighbourhood of London, and the dozens of young workers - many of them contractors, a number of whom were from Eastern Europe - buzzed about with Apple laptops. At the helm, said Wylie, was Mercer's daughter Rebekah, who was president, and conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who was vice president. Running day-to-day operations was a smooth-talking upper-crust Briton, Alexander Nix. Nix did not respond to requests for comment. Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix on Wednesday after a British television sting showed him on secret recordings talking about employing unethical tactics to win elections, including bribery and using sex workers for \"honey pots.\" Wylie said he helped set up the television station's sting. Wylie said that it was under Nix's direction - but with the knowledge of Bannon and Rebekah Mercer - that Cambridge Analytica began an ambitious data-gathering programme that included tapping into the Facebook profiles of 50 million users through the use of a personality-testing app. The company did that with the help of a Russian American psychologist at Cambridge University, Aleksandr Kogan, who also made regular visits back to Russia, according to Wylie. Wylie said he and others at Cambridge Analytica were initially sceptical of the power of this tactic for gathering data. But when the company approved US$1000 for Kogan to experiment with his app, he produced data on 1000 people who downloaded it and roughly 160,000 of their friends - all in a matter of hours. Cambridge Analytica next approved US$10,000 for a second round of testing and was rewarded with nearly a million records, including names, home towns, dates of birth, religious affiliations, work and educational histories, and preferences, as expressed using the popular Facebook \"like\" button on many social media updates, news stories and other online posts. They soon married that data with voter lists and commercial data broker information and discovered they had a remarkably precise portrait of a large swath of the American electorate. Kogan's app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" and portrayed as being for research purposes, gathered data on the 270,000 people who downloaded it and tens of millions of their Facebook friends. It was this data and others that Wylie later worried might have ended up in Russian hands. \"I'm not saying that we put it on a drive and posted it to Vladimir Putin on Number 1 Red Square,\" Wylie said, referring to the Russian president's official residence. But he said that he and others affiliated with Cambridge Analytica briefed Lukoil, a Russian oil company, on its research into American voters. He said Kogan also made regular visits to Russia but acknowledged that he did not know what Kogan did there. Kogan has not replied to requests for comment. Kogan called the suggestions that he was a spy \"just silly\" in an email, seen by CNN, that he wrote to colleagues at Cambridge University. \"If I am Russian spy, I am the world's dumbest spy.\" For Wylie, a data scientist with an avid interest in politics and culture, the collection of Facebook and other data did not initially trouble him. The social media platform made such data grabs easy for app developers - though it began severely restricting them in 2015 - and Wylie saw it as a powerful way to study an entire nation on a scale at once broad and precise. Combined with other data, Cambridge Analytica hoped to profile the entire American electorate - something it already had done in other countries - and determine what pitches would work best for each individual voter. The project also appeared to excite its benefactors. One former Cambridge Analytica employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal corporate matters, described hearing Rebekah Mercer express over the phone excitement at the results of 2014 congressional midterms, when Republicans made significant gains to which Cambrige Analytica said it had contributed. But Wylie and others clashed with Nix, whom he called a \"bully.\" Wylie also grew weary of the increasingly far-right tenor of the politics the researchers were helping to propel. They discovered and refined potent themes about keeping out immigrants, \"draining the swamp\" and restoring an earlier era of national greatness - as understood mainly to mean for white American men. When Wylie told Nix at a London coffee shop in 2014 that he was going to leave at the end of the year, he heard a boast that at the time sounded ridiculous but, in retrospect, haunted him. \"Just you wait,\" Nix told Wylie, according to his recollection. \"You're going to leave, but we're going to be in the White House.\" But it was not clear to Wylie at that point who might lead such an eventual White House bid. In fact, Cambridge Analytica worked with Senator Ted Cruz, (R), during the presidential primary before signing on with the Trump campaign. Months after he and several other Cambridge Analytica employees quit the firm, they got a mysterious message from somebody purporting to represent the Trump Organisation. Wylie and others, unfamiliar with Trump's brewing political ambitions, thought they might find themselves somehow involved in Trump's Apprentice reality television show. Wylie said he ended up speaking with Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, in conference calls in which Lewandowski reportedly described a forthcoming Trump run for president. Lewandowski later met in person with several of Wylie's former Cambridge Analytica colleagues at Trump Tower in spring 2015, Wylie said in an account backed by one of those people who did attend. But the plan to work for the campaign doing voter analysis fizzled, in large part because the mostly liberal former Cambridge Analytica employees didn't want to wade back into conservative politics. Lewandowski said the campaign had been pitched by Cambridge Analytica but never hired them and had no recollection of meeting with any former employees. \"I've never heard of those guys,\" Lewandowski said of Wylie and the other former employees. \"It didn't happen.\" But the brief flirtation did have a concrete consequence. SCL Group threatened legal action against Wylie for supposedly violating a \"noncompete\" clause he signed before quitting. Wylie was confused - he had no idea that the company considered Trump a client or potential client - and began to suspect that he had been set up. To resolve the legal dispute, he signed a nondisclosure agreement that would later complicate his efforts to speak out about the work he had done for Cambridge Analytica. Wylie's sense of uneasiness about that work began building when he heard Trump, in 2016, start using themes that Cambridge Analytica had developed in 2014 about building walls and draining the swamp. More than most, Wylie knew the science behind why they might be effective. His discomfort grew when Bannon formally joined the Trump campaign in August 2016. Election results on November 8, 2016, filled Wylie with a profound sense of dread. A friend who worked on the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and was familiar with Wylie's previous work sent him a message saying, \"What did you do?\" \"Manipulating an election in a small developing country doesn't have the same sort of ripple effect of electing Donald Trump into the White House,\" Wylie said. \"It hit home at the inauguration.\" It is unclear how much Cambridge Analytica contributed to Trump's win. Soon after Trump's inauguration, Wylie began talking with Observer reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who had been working on stories about Cambridge Analytica. He also retained a lawyer, Tamsin Allen, and began working directly with Britain's Information Commissioner's Office, which started an investigation into Cambridge Analytica. Earlier this month, Wylie received a sharply worded letter from Facebook, which demanded access to his smartphone and computer. He refused, saying that he already had shared information with the British authorities and saw no reason to do so with a private company - especially one whose own activities might be called into question. It was not Wylie's first encounter with Facebook. The company had sent a letter in August 2016 saying that Kogan, the Cambridge researcher, should not have shared the data of Facebook users. Downloading names, home towns, work histories and \"likes\" of 50 million users was not against the rules - at least in 2014 - but Kogan should not have transferred the data to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook wrote. Facebook wanted the data destroyed. Wylie said he complied with that request, though he does not know if Kogan or Cambridge Analytica did. (Cambridge Analytica has issued several statements in recent days denying any wrongdoing.) Silicon Valley-based Facebook posted a blog Friday evening - early Saturday morning in London - announcing the suspension of Kogan, Wylie and the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. When he was awakened by a call around 3 a.m. from a reporter, Wylie was furious at Facebook for acting unilaterally and accusing him of misdeeds when he had come forward to authorities. Days later, he still is. Wylie's career as Facebook critic quickly moved to a new level. Lawmakers in the United States and Europe began demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally explain how the data of 50 million users reached a mysterious company with ties to Bannon, the Mercers and Trump. State attorneys general began investigating. So did the Federal Trade Commission over concerns that Facebook had violated a 2011 consent decree over privacy issues. When told that Wylie thought he had been mistreated by Facebook, the social media company responded that Cambridge Analytica and Kogan had agreed to an audit of their servers and systems. \"Mr Wylie thus far has declined.\" Facebook on Wednesday said it would conduct audits of thousands of apps in response to the \"breach of trust\" caused by Cambridge Analytica. \"Facebook is not the government. Facebook is not the state. I'm working with the legal authority,\" Wylie said, referring to the Information Commissioner's Office. \"I'm not going to be bullied by Facebook.\" As for the broader issues - the privacy intrusions of the data collection, the manipulation of voters, the possible role in electing Trump, the possibility that Cambridge Analytica's work might have reached Russians - Wylie feels remorse. Wylie says he wants to expose the machinations of data gathering for political purposes as fully as he's able. He dreams of resuming his work as a data scientist some day. For now, he is something like a full-time whistleblower. In an emotional moment on Wednesday at the Frontline Club, a journalists' club in London, Wylie told a packed audience said that his decision to step forward was about taking responsibility. \"If you've done something wrong, the first step is to try to own up and tell people about it,\" he said. \"I'm on my first step.\"","header":" How Cambridge Analytica's whistleblower became Facebook's unlikely foil  ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:00:59.681Z"},"time":"Friday, 24 August 2018"}

They have both had their leader suspended (only temporarily, naturally) and their future put in doubt, much to the glee of journalists and the public alike. Interestingly they were both caught doing what has been accepted practice in their own industries for years. Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to try and influence people's voting patterns, something which is common in the sense of trying to encourage favourable consumer decisions by showing specific messages to specific groups of people. The real issue is that the data involved shouldn't have been sold to them in the first place. Caveat Emptor. Meanwhile, the Australian Cricket team has pleaded guilty to ball-tampering and the shit has fallen on them from just as great a height. This despite the fact that most, if not all, test teams have at some time been seen to do the same. In both cases the real crime seems to have been to be caught and for that a pink-haired whistleblower and an eagle-eyed South African cameraman must share our thanks. Undoubtedly the fairest punishment for their leaders would be to have them swap jobs, so I propose Steve Smith should take over at Cambridge Analytica while Alexander Nix be announced Captain of the Australian Cricket team. That way old Etonian Nix would get to suffer a life-threatening pounding from an enraged Kagiso Rabada while Smith would have to spend his days trying to cadge money from the American alt-right.

The broadcast by Channel 4 News offered no evidence that such methods were used during Cambridge Analytica's work for the Trump campaign, which paid the firm at least US$6 million. But the broadcast sparked a fresh round of questions about a company already embroiled in controversy about its use of personal information from tens of millions of Facebooks users - the vast majority of whom had no idea their names, likes and work histories had been collected for political purposes. The report, which the Washington Post has not independently confirmed, relied on surreptitious video recordings of Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, claiming to have used \"a web of shadowy front companies\" in pursuit of winning elections. The company disputed the report and others published over the weekend about the company's use of massive troves of Facebook data. \"Cambridge Analytica strongly denies the claims recently made by the New York Times, the Guardian and Channel 4 News,\" the company said on Twitter. Cambridge Analytica elaborated in a statement, saying that it had posed a series of \"ludicrous hypothetical scenarios\" to determine whether the client was someone they should engage with. \"I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,\" Nix said in the statement. \"I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose. I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.\" For Cambridge Analytica, the Channel 4 News expose is only the latest headache for a firm once championed by conservatives - and boosted by US$15 million in funding from Republican mega-donor Robert Mercer, and his daughter, Rebekah. It has ties to Steve Bannon, the former campaign adviser to Trump, whose campaign spent at least US$6 million on the firm's services during the 2016 presidential race. Cambridge Analytica previously aided Republican Senator Ted Cruz during the 2016 presidential primary. According to the video posted by Channel 4 News, Nix appears to suggest the company could \"send some girls around to the candidate's house.\" He later added that he favoured Ukranian women in particular: \"They are very beautiful, I find that works very well.\" The surreptitiously recorded video also appears to depict conversations involving Nix, Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, and Alex Tayler, the chief data officer. The Channel 4 News team reportedly told the company officials they were meeting with a \"fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get candidates elected in Sri Lanka.\" The executives repeatedly appear to brag about their behind-the-scenes efforts to influence political outcomes in Mexico, Australia and Kenya, at one point teasing that they're beginning to work in China, too. In one clip, Turnbull stresses the firm is not \"in the business of fake news, we're not in the business of lying, making stuff up, and we're not in the business of entrapment. So we wouldn't send a pretty girl out to seduce a politician and then film them in their bedroom.\" In a later conversation featuring Nix, however, the chief executive appears to float the idea that they could entrap candidates with potential bribes, \"instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet.\" Nix later added, \"Please don't pay too much attention to what I'm saying because I'm just giving you examples of what can be done, and what has been done.\" In a number of the exchanges, Turnbull stresses the ability of Cambridge Analytica to play on people's \"hopes and fears.\" \"You didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you,\" Turnbull appeared to say, \"and our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really, deep-seated underlying fears, concerns.\" In other clips, Turnbull describes links to former spies while also promising to be discreet, using \"a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.\" Following the expose, Elizabeth Denham, Britain's Information Commissioner, told Channel 4 News that she was \"shocked\" and \"deeply concerned.\" Her office has been conducting a widespread probe, which started last year, into data analytics and political profiling. She said that she would be applying for a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica's databases and servers to \"understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica - there are a lot of conflicting stories about the data.\" When asked if she was concerned about Facebook getting \"ahead\" of her office by sending in its own team to Cambridge Analytica's London offices, she said: \"I think it's very important that we apply for the warrant and that we do the search on behalf of the public.\" But without a warrant, her office was unable to send in its own team. Channel 4 News, the flagship news programme of Channel 4, is a commercially-funded, publicly-owned broadcaster, which operates separately from the BBC.","header":" Cambridge Analytica CEO appears to talk about election bribes, sex workers on video  ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:02:29.128Z"},"time":"Friday, 24 August 2018"}

The company filed for voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy in a New York court late on Thursday after being buried by legal fees and lost business, according to the Daily Mail. Cambridge Analytica LLC listed assets as about US$100,001 ($144,615) to US$500,000 and liabilities in the range of US$1 million to US$10m. SCL Group, parent company of Cambridge Analytica, is also closing in the wake of rising legal costs in the Facebook investigation and loss of clients. The company admitted making mistakes over the misuse of data harvested from Facebook accounts. Suspended boss Alexander Nix will appear before the British Parliament's media committee on June 6 to be grilled as it investigates the scandal. The row over the improper use of data on 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica in President Donald Trump's 2016 US election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world's biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations. Cambridge Analytica employees were told the firm would be closing during a conference call with all staff. The company said it had \"unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully\" but \"the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers.\" \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration,\" it say earlier this month. Staff lamented the firm's end by listening to songs such as 'The End' by The Doors, and 'Help!' by The Beatles, according to US website Gizmodo. A sign belonging to the firm outside its London offices has already been taken down. The firm said it was the subject of \"numerous unfounded accusations\" and vilified despite its attempts to correct the record. It claimed its activities were \"not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\" Cambridge Analytica added it had \"unwavering confidence\" that its employees acted ethically and lawfully, which was supported by the report of independent investigator Julian Malins. \"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers,\" it said. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\"","header":" Cambridge Analytica files for bankruptcy after being buried by legal fees and lost business  ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:02:46.828Z"},"time":"Friday, 24 August 2018"}

The spokesperson said local customer data was not at risk of misuse similar to that which occurred internationally. Cambridge Analytica had not provided the Warehouse with services ''remotely similar'' to those in the news overseas. \"None of our customer data has been shared with them [Cambridge Analytica]. We comply with NZ privacy laws and in accordance with our privacy policy.\" The spokesperson added that the Warehouse takes data security \"very seriously\".  \"We collect and hold customer data only to provide the best products and services we can and to respond to customer requests. We do not pass it on to anyone else or use it in any other way without customer consent.\" Cambridge Analytica has faced massive scrutiny this week, following reports in the New York Times and The Guardian that the data firm used information gleaned from Facebook users to build psychographic profiles of ten of millions of people in its work for the Donald Trump presidential campaign. This information was harvested via a personality test app, which asked seemingly innocuous questions not dissimilar from those often presented on Facebook quizzes. Christoper Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, was quoted in The Guardian saying: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\" Following the hard-hitting report, Facebook insisted that the Cambridge data collection was not a \"data breach\" because \"everyone involved gave their consent\" to share their data. The purported research app followed Facebook's existing privacy rules. The scandal overseas has had a major impact on Facebook, leading to a 7 per cent drop in the company's stock price. Facebook is also facing regulatory action, with Britain's information commissioner saying on Tuesday she is using all her legal powers to investigate the handling of millions of people's personal Facebook data by the social media giant and by political campaign consultants Cambridge Analytica. Advertising executive Paul Catmur earlier this week told the Herald the data practices employed by Cambridge Analytica were commonplace among data firms working in marketing. \"They're selling baked beans like they're selling politicians,\" said Catmur, who works as the chief executive at Barnes, Catmur \u0026 Friends Dentsu. \"What Cambridge Analytica did for the Trump campaign seems currently no different to what they or a number of similar firms do for commercial clients. Nobody currently seems too upset about the use of psychographic methods to sell toothpaste, but they are up in arms to see it used to manipulate support for a right-wing president.\" There have also been calls for data laws in New Zealand to evolve to better protect consumers. Barry Brailey, a cybersecurity specialist at Aura Information Security, would welcome the introduction of similar laws in this market. \"When someone else holds something of yours that is valuable, they have a duty to look after it,\" says Brailey. \"They also have a duty to let you know if something happens to it – and that's really what notification laws codify.\"","header":" Controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica linked with The Warehouse  ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:03:05.221Z"},"time":"Friday, 24 August 2018"}

It was formed as a subsidiary of SCL, a British company that describes itself as specialising in data, analytics and strategy. Mr. Bannon helped secure funding for CA from American billionaire Robert Mercer and his family, who are major donors to right-wing causes and Republican party campaigns.Chris Wylie, a 28-year old former employee of the company, revealed details of the company’s modus operandi  to journalist Carole Cadwalladr in an expose published in the Observer newspaper last weekend.According to Mr. Wylie, CA acquired the data in 2014 via personality profiling app thisisyourdigitallife, built by Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University. While the app was downloaded by just 2,70,000 Facebook users, it pulled in data from the “Facebook friends” of these users, allowing CA to harvest the data of 50 million users, without their consent. Information campaigns were then microtargeted at these users based on their preferences and vulnerabilities (for instance). Mr. Kogan has denied he was aware his tool was possibly being used illegally and says he is being scapegoated by Facebook and CA.\nShort of deleting your account, what can you do to limit Facebook’s data collection? Things got worse for CA on Monday when UK broadcaster Channel 4 aired a program in which the company’s (now suspended) CEO Alexander Nix described some of its dubious election strategies to an undercover reporter. These strategies included using women and offering deals that are “too good to be true” to politicians, and video-recording these interactions and posting them online in order to discredit a candidate.SCL, CA and their partners have been involved in political campaigns around the world, including in India, where SCL partnered with Ovleno Business Intelligence Pv.t Ltd., which had claimed on its website (now unavailable) to have worked with the BJP, Congress and the JD(U). Both the Congress and BJP traded charges on Wednesday on this issue.\nCambridge Analytica controversy: Urgent need for data protection laws, say experts\nFacebook, in a statement, denied that Mr. Kogan’s app involved data breaches but said that Mr. Kogan did not abide by Facebook’s rules when he passed on the information to CA/SCL, a fact that came to Facebook’s notice in 2015. The social media platform consequently deleted the app and asked Mr. Kogan and others who had been given the data to certify that it had been destroyed. After the Wylie story broke last weekend, it had come to light that at least some of the data still existed, prompting Facebook to send cybersecurity analysts to CA’s London offices for a data audit. These auditors were subsequently recalled owing to a parallel U.K. government inquiry.CA is being investigated by the U.K.’s Electoral Commission for its role in the Brexit referendum as well as by the Office of the Information Commissioner (OIC), based on previous reports about its dubious methods. In the U.S., Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian links to the Trump campaign, is looking into CA’s role in this affair as well.A House of Commons parliamentary committee has asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg to appear before it to answer questions on CA’s data usage. Across the Atlantic, lawmakers have said Mr. Zuckerburg should appear before the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament has said it will investigate the issue.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 8:19:35 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/the-hindu-explains-the-cambridge-analytica-saga/article23314540.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nThe Cambridge Analytica saga: The Hindu explains\n","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:03:22.644Z"},"time":"\n\nMarch 21, 2018 22:21 IST\n\n"}

SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.\n\nCambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.The company, which the New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign before helping Mr. Trump’s.Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women’s clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a U.S. auto insurer interested in marketing itself.Britain’s Channel 4 News reported on March 19, based on secretly recorded video, that Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta’s campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. Cambridge Analytica denied the report.The company’s website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.After Mr. Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm’s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported in 2017. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a “secret sauce” it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nRival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company’s claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Mr. Trump’s digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica’s data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation.From 2014, Cambridge Analytica obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, the New York Times and London’s Observer reported on March 17.The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Mr. Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.Cambridge Analytica said on March 17 that it did not initially know Mr. Kogan violated Facebook’s terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Mr. Kogan could not be reached for comment.The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on March 17. Cambridge Analytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim.Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Mr. Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules.Facebook’s probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s office and asked Facebook’s auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook.Attorneys-General from the U.S. States of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the Attorney-General’s office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 8:33:36 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/who-is-cambridge-analytica-and-what-did-it-do/article23304317.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nWho is Cambridge Analytica and what did it do?

It’s the new economy, after all. Traditional valuation doesn’t necessarily apply. The companies which are the most valuable are the companies with the most information, not necessarily the most products, or the most sales. ‘Number of Daily Active Users’, ‘Time spent’, ‘Level of engagement’ and ‘Behavioral insights’ are the new measures of value.These companies are valued on the basis of the data that they are harvesting off us and, consequently, how well they know us. They are valued on the basis of how deeply they have infiltrated our private lives. Strip away all the financial jargon and you will realise that the primary reason why the market values these companies so highly is that they have built up an astronomical database of user data that can be leveraged and monetised.In slightly different terms, when we log into Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Amazon or Google, we aren’t customers using a product — we become the product. Our lives, our activities, our deepest darkest secrets, our cravings, our fears, our voyeurism — crystallised into ‘data points’. And if that wasn’t enough, it is ‘social’. So, we help these companies grow their data by connecting with friends, and pulling exponentially more people on board this mass data harvester. We make our own decisions but have willingly chosen to expose our lives, our likes, dislikes, our friends and their lives to massive Big Data Crunchers. Why? Because it is convenient. Because it was ‘free’. Yes, because instead of charging someone a huge amount of money to have access to our personal lives and information, we willingly gave it away in exchange for ‘convenience’. For the opportunity to stay in touch with friends. Actually, scratch that; it was for the opportunity to peek into other peoples lives. And for the opportunity to project an image of oneself to all of one’s acquaintances. Zuckerberg made his billions not by writing killer code — he made his money by understanding just how desperate we are for approval, just how voyeuristic we can be, and how little we value our own privacy when offered ease in exchange.Silicon Valley has a particular talent for preachy spiels. Once we look past the Valleyspeak quotes like ‘Making the World a Better Place’, we can see this exchange for exactly what it is — an exchange of information for convenience. It is a choice that we made... a sort of Faustian deal. Technically, they informed us. But did we really read all the legal gobbledegook before clicking ‘I Accept’?Zuckerberg, that master of spin, in a post on Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, attempts to mollify, apologise, reassure and preach at the same time. He tries to reflect the anger that Facebook users have been venting when he talks about how his company “doesn’t deserve to serve” users if they cannot keep their data safe. He goes on to try and reassure us by telling us that ‘corrective action’ was taken years ago (after the breach) and that this sort of thing could not happen again. The underlying theme is that Facebook serves us (which is the exactly backwards — in reality, we serve Facebook) and that they are a responsible and trusted organisation who have suffered a data breach. Those of us who ‘felt unsafe’ because an unauthorised agency had gained access to our data could now be ‘reassured’ that our trusted friend Mark solved the data breach problem. Except that if you scratch the surface, you can expose the flaws in the logic.For a start, he didn’t tell us why his company was silent about the Cambridge Analytica story for as long as they were. If indeed it was ‘our’ information that he was guarding like a faithful, trustworthy watchman (because he believes that by ‘serving’ us he is making the world a better place), then he would have alerted us as soon as the breach occurred. The reality, as it emerges, is that unethical data trawling by app developers was something of an open secret. By their own admission, Facebook attempted to persuade Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. And they only responded when they were forced to, when it all blew up in their faces, and when their share price took a hit. Some experts are of the view that it is beginning to look as if the flaw is systemic, and that the CA data breach isn’t a one-off blip, as the folks at Facebook would have us believe.Few people got on Facebook because they trusted Facebook with their deepest darkest secrets — most people got on Facebook because their friends were on Facebook. It wasn’t really a well-thought-out decision, robust in logic. It was an impulsive, almost illogical choice in most cases. It was a sticky, addictive, fun way of connecting and sharing our lives. The truth is, we suspended our rationality when we signed up, when we didn’t really read the disclaimer, when we didn’t exchange queries and emails with this company before entrusting it with so much personal information. It was easy... and fun... and addictive as hell. So we didn’t give them our information because we trusted them or their ethical standards. We signed up on a whim, because our friends were signed up. It was really that simplistic a drive.\nThe generation that uses social media never really had to fight for civil rights or liberties. And because we have never had to fight for our freedom and privacy, we do not value it enough.\n If you follow this line of reasoning, it doesn’t really matter who has this very personal, private information about private civilian citizens. The real problem is that such a database exists. If it exists, the chances are that it will be misused. And it only exists because we are ok with it, because we willingly barter our freedom and privacy away without a thought or care in the world.And so, to those who are outraged about Cambridge Analytica, I ask you to consider an alternative hypothetical scenario. Assume that Cambridge Analytica paid a whopping large sum of money to Facebook and acquired all the information legally. Or what if Cambridge Analytica bought enough stake in the company to warrant a position on the board? When such large sums of money and vast swathes of data are involved, the best coders and statisticians will engage the best lawyers to find ways and means to make it happen. Cambridge Analytica will still have access to your information — information that they will sell or use in any way they choose to profit from. Is a data sale any different from a data breach, as far as you are concerned? The only difference is that Facebook makes a fortune in a sale, but doesn’t when it is stolen.Or consider another hypothetical scenario where Facebook itself diversified (very quietly and obscurely) into professional political campaign management. No data breach. But your data is being used by the very same people who bought it from CA. Are you better off?Or perhaps consider a hypothetical scenario where Mark Zuckerberg decides to run for President. Again, no data breach. But you have a candidate who knows his electorate better than any candidate in history. Unfair advantage? Manipulating the electorate? Are you any better off?Back home in India, I have been amused by the charges and counter-charges being bandied about by the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party about who used the services of Cambridge Analytica. It wouldn’t surprise me one bit to come to know that both of them hired the firm for availing its user/voter analytics research. The stakes are so high and the data is so thorough, complete and personal, that even if one of them felt any pangs of conscience about using the data, the thought or fear of their rival approaching CA would drive them to use CA’s services anyway. And, lets face it, buying or using dubiously acquired data from a consulting firm to help in political campaigns would not feature in the list of the ‘1,000 most Heinous Crimes Committed by Political Parties in India’.Perhaps the saddest fallout of this entire fiasco is the revelation of just how little we value our freedom and privacy. Perhaps we take it for granted. The generation that uses social media never really had to fight for civil rights or liberties. Indira Gandhi’s Emergency, to us, is a chapter in a history book. And because we have never had to fight for our freedom and privacy, we do not value it enough. We trade it in for the opportunity to stay in touch with an old school crush, to impress our friends, or keep tabs on our relatives. Any outrage that we feel towards Cambridge Analytica or Facebook must first be directed inwards.And yes, in case you are wondering, I do appreciate the sheer deliciousness of the irony in sharing an article about the perils and evils of social media on social media itself.","header":"Who is to blame?

But Facebook is not the only Silicon Valley titan facing difficult questions about ethics and trust.Earlier this year, about 3,100 Google employees signed and internally circulated a letter protesting Google’s involvement with Project Maven, a Pentagon program. As a partner in the project, Google will help develop advanced Artificial Intelligence capabilities for military drones. The employees’ letter begins, “We believe that Google should not be in the business of war... We ask that Project Maven be cancelled, and that Google draft, publicise, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.” It goes on to add that if Google doesn’t withdraw from Project Maven, it will “irreparably damage Google’s brand and its ability to compete for talent.”\nUsers own data, but they license it to us: Zuckerberg Yet another instance of a backlash involves YouTube. On April 3, Nasim Najafi Aghdam, 38, entered the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, and opened fire, injuring three people, before shooting herself. While investigations are still on, it has been reported that her motive was to hit back at YouTube for its new ‘demonetisation policy’. Aghdam had a channel on YouTube. As a participant in the YouTube Partner Program, she apparently earned a decent income from monetising her content through advertisements. But YouTube recently tightened its rules for video content that is eligible for monetisation, raising the bar from 10,000 lifetime views to 4,000 viewing hours in the last 12 months and 1,000 subscribers. This straightaway disqualified a huge number of smaller YouTubers. While Aghdam was later characterised as being mentally unstable, it may be that her principal complaint had been her belief that YouTube had unfairly suppressed content creators.\nCambridge Analytica hiding the facts, says India Lastly we have Uber, which is no stranger to controversy. In March, around 650 taxi drivers blocked traffic and set off fireworks in front of the EU headquarters in Brussels to protest against the Belgian government’s draft legislation that would give cab licences to individuals instead of firms, a move that they feared would favour Uber and destroy local taxi companies. The drivers believed, and correctly so, that Uber’s employee-less workforce and incentive-based payment system could decimate their unions and protected wages.These cases, involving four of the tech world’s most valuable businesses, suggest a pattern of profound inability among Silicon Valley majors to recognise certain humanistic concerns of the communities they profess to serve.

(File)\n \n| Photo Credit: \nAP\n Breaking more than four days of silence, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted mistakes and outlined steps to protect user data in light of a privacy scandal involving a Trump-connected data-mining firm.\nThe Hindu Explains: The Cambridge Analytica Saga\nMr. Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that Facebook has a “responsibility” to protect its users’ data and if it fails, “we don’t deserve to serve you.”Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook’s No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, have been quiet since news broke on Friday that Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to sway elections.Facebook has already taken the most important steps to prevent such a situation from happening again, Zuckerberg said. For example, in 2014, it reduced access outside apps had to user data. However, some of the measures didn’t take effect until a year later, allowing Cambridge to access the data in the intervening months.Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledges that there is more the company needs to do.\nShort of deleting your account, what can you do to limit Facebook’s data collection? In a Facebook post, Mr. Zuckerberg said it will ban developers who don’t agree to an audit. An app’s developer will no longer have access to data from people who haven’t used that app in three months. Data will also be generally limited to user names, profile photos and email, unless the developer signs a contract with Facebook and gets user approval.Earlier in the day, an academic who developed the app used by Cambridge Analytica to harvest data said that he had no idea his work would be used in Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.Alexandr Kogan, a psychology researcher at Cambridge University, told the BBC that both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have tried to place the blame on him for violating the social media platform’s terms of service, even though Cambridge Analytica ensured him that everything he did was legal.\nBJP sees Congress-Cambridge Analytica link; Cong. terms it fake agenda “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” he said. “Honestly, we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately, we thought we were doing something that was really normal.”Authorities in Britain and the United States are investigating the alleged improper use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based political research firm.Facebook shares have dropped some 9 per cent, lopping more than $50 billion off the company’s market value, since the revelations were first published, raising questions about whether social media sites are violating users’ privacy.The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was suspended yesterday after Britain’s Channel 4 News broadcast hidden camera footage of him suggesting the company could use young women to catch opposition politicians in compromising positions. Footage also showed Nix bragging about the firm’s pivotal role in the Trump campaign.Nix said Cambridge Analytica handled “all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting” for the Trump campaign, and used emails with a “self-destruct timer” to make the firm’s role more difficult to trace.“There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing,” he said.In a statement, Cambridge Analytica’s board said Nix’s comments “do not represent the values or operations of the firm, and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.”Facebook itself is drawing criticism from politicians on both sides of the Atlantic for its alleged failure to protect users’ privacy.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 8:34:42 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/facebook-made-mistakes-on-cambridge-analytica-says-zuckerberg/article23315992.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nFacebook 'made mistakes' on Cambridge Analytica, says Zuckerberg ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:04:46.951Z"},"time":"\n\nMarch 22, 2018 01:16 IST\n\n"}

Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office, which is investigating SCL Group and CA as part of a wider probe into the use of personal data and analytics in political campaigns and beyond, said it would continue its civil and criminal investigations and pursue individuals and directors “as appropriate and necessary”. It will also monitor successor companies to “ensure the public is safeguarded”. “We will be examining closely the details of the announcements of the winding down of Cambridge Analytica and the status of its parent company,” it said in a statement.A separate investigation by the House of Commons committee on digital, culture, media and sport into fake news will also continue to examine issues relating to the organisation. “Cambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing. The investigations into their work are vital,” said the committee’s chair Damian Collins.Earlier this week, the committee sent a strongly-worded letter to Facebook, with 40 questions that had not yet been answered in its testimony, and a deadline of May 11 for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to agree to give evidence directly to the panel before May 24, failing which a formal summons could be issued to him.Insolvency proceedings On Wednesday night, CA said it and SCL Elections would be commencing insolvency proceedings after “numerous and unfounded” accusations, vilification, and “siege of media coverage” had “driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers”. Over the past months, CA and its associated organisations have been embroiled in allegations that the Facebook profiles of millions of Americans had been wrongly harvested and used by the company, while a separate undercover investigation by Britain’s Channel 4 News pointed to some of the unsavoury tactics that the company touted as some of the means that it used to help political campaigns achieve their goals. Questions have also been raised around the role the company played in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and campaigns for Britain to leave the EU, as well as in India and beyond. Documents made public by whistleblower Christopher Wylie highlighted the “extensive” work conducted by SCL Elections in India, helping parties target audiences based on factors such as caste.“Cambridge Analytica specialises in disinformation! We need to make sure their shutdown is not just some rebranding or a way to hide from investigations. The SAME PEOPLE set up ANOTHER COMPANY and yesterday issued new company resolutions!,” tweeted Mr. Wylie, pointing to Emerdata, a company set up in August 2017. According to Emerdata’s Companies House record in the U.K., its business involves “data processing, hosting and related activities”, while Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of CA, was appointed as a director in February, only for this to be terminated in April.

They included particularly concerning instances of the role AIQ had played in disseminating violent video content by social media in Nigeria, as part of work there. Cambridge Analytica was an example of “modern day colonialism,” he suggested at one point.“This is a company that has gone around the world and undermined the democratic process,” he said. “You have a wealthy company from a developed nation going into an economy or democracy still struggling to get its feet on the ground and taking advantage of that.”\nU.S. regulator probes Facebook Among allegations made by Mr. Wylie was the suggestion that Vote Leave, one of the main campaigns that pushed for Brexit, may have broken Britain’s electoral rules that went beyond existing concerns around spending infractions, over the role that AIQ played in the campaign.“This is not about leave or remain. It’s about the integrity of the democratic process,” said Mr. Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, who earlier this month, revealed details of how the firm had inappropriately gathered Facebook data used to target voters in the US, dating back to 2014, using an app developed by Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan.Mr. Wylie insisted, that despite his “pink hair and nose ring” he was one of the “rare breeds of progressive Eurosceptics.”AIQ has long maintained its independence from Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group — but Mr. Wylie insisted that Aggregate IQ, while not owned by Cambridge Analytica, held the licence to the intellectual property that formed the basis of Cambridge Analytica’s software, and effectively operated as an “internal entity” that were kept at arm’s length for purposes of political expediency.\nUK MPs demand Zuckerberg testify He also described as “categorically untrue” claims that Cambridge Analytica had never used Facebook data, citing the app, which had been the “foundational dataset of the company”. Past evidence given by suspended Cambridge Analytica head Alexander Nix to the committee had been “dishonest” and “misleading”, he said.During a lengthy session in which MPs from across the political spectrum on the culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee quizzed Mr. Wylie, he provided a snapshot of the work carried out by the firms, currently in the spotlight, highlighting how data captured enabled them to build up psychological profiles of individuals who would be particularly susceptible to forms of certain tactics.During the Brexit referendum campaign, for example, rather than focussing on everyone in the country, AIQ focussed on 5 to 7 million people who were their “core” universe, blasting them with adverts in a “calculated way”. Between 5 and 7% of cases it resulted in the targeted individuals carrying out a “substantive action” for the leave campaign — highlighting the important role that AIQ’s work played in the campaign and the final result.\nWho is Alexander Nix? Asked whether the results swayed the referendum vote he insisted that was irrelevant. If someone was caught doping in the Olympics one lost one’s medal either way. “This is a breach of the law…this is cheating this is an irreversible change to the constitutional settlement of this country.”Mr. Wylie’s testimony is the latest in a series of dramatic developments that brought together questions about Brexit, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.“Christopher Wylie was a part-time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since that date,” Cambridge Analytica said on Tuesday, as Wylie gave testimony.Investigative work by the Observer newspaper, Channel 4 and The New York Times, with Shahmir Sanni, a member of the BeLeave pro-Brexit group, has alleged that Vote Leave may have broken the rules by using BeLeave as a front for spending above the allowed limit, purportedly giving the group £625,000 to funnel into Aggregate IQ.After the referendum, senior figures within Vote Leave had attributed some of their success to the work of the Canadian firm. Vote Leave “pretended” to give BeLeave the money, which had “no control over it,” Mr. Sanni told the Observer over the weekend.During his testimony, Mr. Wylie alleged that senior figures in Vote Leave had used BeLeave to “launder” money. Bindmans, a law firm, said there was sufficient evidence to suggest a criminal offence could have been committed by the campaign.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 8:35:18 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cambridge-analytica-worked-in-india-christopher-wylie/article23366033.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nCongress was Cambridge Analytica’s client: Christopher Wylie\n","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:05:22.763Z"},"time":"\n\nMarch 27, 2018 21:09 IST\n\n"}

Rest assured, India, Kenya, Nigeria, all the other countries that SCL has been working in historically, will be investigated and reported on as part of the independent investigation,” he told reporters during a press conference here on Wednesday.\nThe Cambridge Analytica saga: The Hindu explains\nThe press conference came soon after an academic associated with the company, Aleksandr Kogan, gave his evidence to the UK Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee on its ongoing investigation into fake news.Mr. Kogan’s company, Global Science Research (GSR), developed a Facebook app that reportedly collected data from people who signed up to use the app as well as information from their Facebook friends, without the explicit approval of all involved.He accused CA’s now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix of “total fabrication” when it came to denying the links between Cambridge Analytica and GSR’s data.DCMS Committee chair Damian Collins said that Nix had told the committee in February that CA never received data from Mr. Kogan’s company GSR, which did not have “much credibility any more given his own testimony today.Last month, Christopher Wylie, a former employee of CA turned whistleblower, had told MPs during his evidence before the committee that the company had worked “extensively” in India and named the Congress as one of its clients.In a post on Twitter later, the 28-year-old also named the Janata Dal (United) as a client during the 2010 Bihar elections and revealed some caste surveys carried out in Uttar Pradesh by SCL India - the parent company of CA.“I’ve been getting a lot of requests from Indian journalists, so here are some of SCL’s past projects in India. To the most frequently asked question - yes SCL/CA works in India and has offices there. This is what modern colonialism looks like,” Mr. Wylie had tweeted.His message included documents which indicate that SCL India boasted a database of “over 600 districts and 7 lakh villages, which is constantly being updated”. Its reach in India is said to include a head office in Ghaziabad, with nine regional offices in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Cuttack, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata, Patna and Pune.“I don’t remember a national project but I know regionally. India’s so big that one State can be as big as Britain. But they do have offices there, they do have staff there,” he had said, offering to provide more “documentation” to the committee on CA’s India links.Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day!Please enter a valid email address.\nPrintable version | Aug 23, 2018 8:35:36 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/involvement-in-india-will-be-investigated-cambridge-analytica/article23669259.ece\nOur existing notification subscribers need to choose this option to keep getting the alerts.","header":"\nInvolvement in India will be investigated: Cambridge Analytica ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:05:41.072Z"},"time":"\n\nApril 25, 2018 15:38 IST\n\n"}

Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump in 2016, has denied its work on the US president’s successful election campaign made use of data allegedly improperly harvested from around 87 million Facebook users. Former chief Alexander Nix, in earlier testimony to parliament’s media committee, also denied the political consultancy had ever been given data by Aleksandr Kogan, the researcher linked to the scandal. On Wednesday he said it had received data from Kogan.“Of course, the answer to this question should have been ‘yes,'” Nix said, adding that he thought he was being asked if Cambridge Analytica still held data from the researcher.He denied deliberately misleading British lawmakers and said the company had deleted the data, which had been of no use. The committee is investigating fake news, and focusing on the role of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook in the 2016 Brexit vote as well as the Trump election. In lengthy, and often testy, questioning by lawmakers, Nix apologised for an undercover film in which he said Cambridge Analytica’s online campaign played a decisive role in Trump’s election win. But he defended the now-defunct consultancy’s reputation and said he felt victimised.Also Read: Facebook responds to govt notice on data breach; Cambridge Analytica’s reply awaitedCambridge Analytica said after the film was broadcast by Channel 4 television in March that the comments did not “represent the values or operations of the firm.” Lawmakers asked Nix to return to face questions about inconsistencies in his evidence. Kogan had told lawmakers he did give Cambridge Analytica the data. Facebook says Kogan harvested it by creating an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own but also their friends’ personal data. Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica.EMBARRASSED BUT VINDICATEDNix apologised for his comments in the film, saying he had been foolish and had made exaggerated claims in order to attract what he thought was a potential client. “It’s not only deeply embarrassing, but it’s something I regret enormously,” he said.Nix said that Channel 4 had heavily edited the footage to portray him in a worse light. “All Mr Nix’s comments carried in our reports were used in context, including any caveats,” the broadcaster said in a statement. On other matters, Nix was less apologetic. He said that he was vindicated in saying Cambridge Analytica had not been involved in the Brexit campaign by a report by the Electoral Commission, and that whistleblower Christopher Wylie had lied about the consultancy’s involvement in Brexit. Wylie had told the committee that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in the campaign.Also Read: Cambridge Analytica files for Chapter Seven bankruptcyOn Wednesday he told Channel 4: “I actually backed up everything I said with documents. I am quite comfortable standing by the statements that I made.”Nix denied a story in the Financial Times that he had withdrawn $8 million from Cambridge Analytica before its collapse last month. Asked about a Guardian report that a Cambridge Analytica employee visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2017, he said he had been unaware of the meeting.","header":"Ex-Cambridge Analytica CEO admits getting Facebook data from researcher","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:05:59.959Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

The controversy has raised new concerns regarding the misuse of data on social media sites, privacy of users and the power of social media to influence important political outcomes.While the controversy unfolded, allegations were made about the connection of Cambridge Analytica with Indian politics. Irrespective of whether these allegations are correct, the truth is that the data of Indian social media users has been out in the open, unprotected, for quite some time now.Statistica, an online data portal, estimates that India will have about 492.68 million mobile phone internet users by 2022. The data portal also reckons that, in 2019, there would be around 258.27 million social network users in India — up from 168.1 million in 2016. Facebook is projected to have close to 319 million users in India by 2021.Digital networking on such a massive scale has given people the opportunity to communicate with one another and exchange ideas across the world. But the flip side of such exchanges is that the data of these social media users can be exploited to extract personal information. The information of social media users, including their browsing history, is used for targeted cross platform advertising. The problem, however is that, as senior journalist Mandira Moddie points out, analysed in bulk, this information can reveal intimate psychological profiling, including ideological preferences, which can help campaign managers to influence crucial political outcomes in democracies.All of this has naturally raised concerns about the country’s data protection laws. India follows the Information Technology Act, 2000. Under the Act, only passwords, financial information — such as bank details — information pertaining to a person’s physical, physiological and mental health conditions and sexual orientation, medical records and biometrics are identified as “sensitive personal data”. Entities handling such data are required to have “reasonable security practices and procedures”. This means that different entities can choose their own reasonable security procedures to protect sensitive data. Such a law points to the vulnerability of data of social media users and the need for more stringent data protection laws.After the recent data breach, questions were raised about the security of data held by the Election Commission of India (ECI). I believe that the worry regarding the ECI’s data is unnecessary. The Commission holds two kinds of data — electoral rolls and election results. The electoral rolls do not consist of sensitive information, which might reveal personal history or the ideological preferences of voters. All it has is the voter’s name, age, name of father/ spouse, and address. All this is already in the public domain. This data has already been used to target specific audience segments. The BJP’s famous panna pramukhs — in charge of one page each of electoral rolls — conduct such analyses on a regular basis to reach out to voters. This, to my mind, is a perfectly legitimate democratic activity. In this context, technology is a labour saving — and not an intrusive — instrument.The other set of data pertains to voting information, including election results. Such data is, of course, very sensitive, sacrosanct and secret. It is, however, contained in the EVMs and is not linked to any external sources. The data on results is, therefore, absolutely secure.Questions have been raised if linking the ECI’s data with Aadhaar will compromise privacy and security. There, too, my answer is no. The only objective of linking ECI with Aadhaar is to detect duplicate voters — a major concern. Biometrics will involve checking impersonation only.Where does Facebook come into this? The ECI has, time and again, collaborated with Facebook for its voter outreach and education programmes. Facebook has helped the ECI reach a large number of voters, especially the youth. The collaboration has been a productive one for Indian democracy. The ECI, in fact, recommended a special award to FB for this work by the President of India on National Voters Day on January 25. After the recent events, Chief Election Commission, O P Rawat did say that there was a need to review the ECI-Facebook collaboration. Subsequently, though, the ECI has affirmed that its partnership with FB will continue.There is no doubt, however, about the need for a stricter data regulation framework in India to avoid data abuse, and prevent undue influencing of voters. Any element which could influence election results is a concern and must be kept under close scrutiny. It is relevant here to refer to Section 171C of IPC which deals with “Undue Influence at Elections”. “Whoever voluntarily interferes or attempts to interfere with the free exercise of any electoral right commits the offence of undue influence at an election,” the section notes. This includes threatening a candidate or voter “with injury of any kind” or “inducing or attempting to induce a candidate or voter to believe that he or any person in whom he is interested will become or will be rendered an object of divine displeasure”. Violation carries a punishment of an year’s imprisonment and/or fine.Winning elections and defeating rivals in an electoral contest is a normal democratic activity. Segmentation of targeted audiences and selective targeting is an old marketing practice that is also followed by election campaigners. But the content of messaging must be ethical and legal. It should not violate laws, regulations or codes such as the Representation of People’s Act, the Indian Penal Code and the Model Code of Conduct. The message should not carry hate speech, it should not amount to disrupting election campaigns or contain personal attacks or appeal on the basis of religion or caste.The rules that apply to media must apply to social media as well. The application of these rules cannot be ignored because they might be “tougher” to implement in the latter’s case.Profiling of political orientation of citizens for intimidation or undue influencing by governments, political parties and individuals has serious implications and points to the need for adequate legal/ technical safeguards. Stricter data protection laws, more security and safeguarding the privacy of individuals are, therefore, essential if we are to survive this age of technology and emerge as a stronger and more efficient democracy.Its general election was conducted in a transparent manner, with robust processes ..The political drama has stoked important questions about parties, alliances, and the role of governor..The long list of exemptions has made the office of profit a farce.

Facebook and Twitter have over the past decade become important platforms for any political campaign. But we now know that the use of these social media platforms is not limited to just airing rhetoric.Well, to start with, based on your interactions with Facebook over time, the platform has enough data about your likes and dislikes. It knows the kind of people you follow, the types of news sources you read and the range of actions and reactions these posts elicit from you. All these data points in combination are good enough to know your political affiliation, or a lack of such inclination.Also read: Facebook Chief Mark Zuckerberg promises fix: What he said, what he did notWhile none of us really use this, there is a Facebook ad preferences page that tells you how the social network sees you in reference to serving ads. It is not a perfect science at all, but based on your likes and dislikes Facebook lists the topics, people and interests which it thinks are good enough to push ads to you.For instance, if you follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s page, ads that are targeted to those who have shown Narendra Modi as an interest will be served to you. In my case, these ranged from a tractor ad — just misplaced marketing — to a news story on Modi from a magazine to other politicians trying to cash in on the PM’s popularity. Often this promises a good conversion rate.No. And this is where it gets interesting. Cambridge Analytica used data from an app called ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ to gather information about users. The firm acquired the data from Aleksandr Kogan, who had created this quiz app to tap into personal profiles on Facebook.  Given that this app was a personality quiz, the questions would have been designed to glean behaviour that gave away much more details on political leanings and other related aspects. This data would have given more granular details about what would be potential voters.Also read: #DeleteFacebook…and go where? With ads of all kinds, Facebook allows a good degree of targeting. The more targeted a campaign, the lower its reach and the costlier it gets. Usually, the targeting is based on age, location and interests. But with the kind of data Cambridge Analytica had, they would have been able to target, let’s say, the 12 voters in Riverdale, Arkansas, who it gathered had not made up their minds on whom to vote for, but had a high probability of moving.Read more: Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data leaks: A wake-up call Or let’s say it could target the pro-Trump campaign to a set of people it was sure were disgruntled with the economic slowdown and resultant jobs.

In a sting operation by Britain’s Channel 4 News, Alexander Nix is heard boasting to an undercover reporter that his company helped Donald Trump win the elections.Since the allegations surfaced, Cambridge Analytica, Nix and Trump’s campaign have denied the allegations. Facebook has expressed outrage at the alleged misuse of data by the firm.What is Cambridge Analytica?Cambridge Analytica is a British firm which was created in 2013 with $15 million in funding from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer. It is a subsidiary of Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), a government and military contractor. The company, which has a clientele of both politicians and corporates, offers services in consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services. It aided Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign before helping Trump’s campaign. It is also known for helping the ‘Leave’ side in the Brexit referendum.The company has five offices in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia.What are the allegations levelled against the company?In a video released by Channel 4, CEO Nix is heard saying the company helped Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta’s campaigns for the 2013 and 2017 elections. He also reveals that the company could use bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians around the world.Channel 4 wrote in its latest story: “In the meetings, the executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) had worked in more than two hundred elections across the world, including Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic, India and Argentina.”In reference to Trump’s presidential campaign, it is accused of illegally accessing the personal data of millions of Facebook users in 2014 in a bid to manipulate the outcome of polls.The company has denied all allegations.Also read | UK firm that ‘breached’ Facebook data worked in India as well: reportHow did it get hold on Facebook data?The data was reportedly accessed through an application, developed by British academic and psychology professor at Cambridge University Aleksandr Kogan. He was allegedly paid $800,000 to develop thisisyourdigitallife. After around 27,000 people downloaded the app and logged in via Facebook, he gathered their data and the data of their friends — without consent — and passed on to Cambridge Analytica.What kind of data was he interested in?The app, thisisyourdigitallife, accessed the users’ basic information such as city of residence, as well as details about their friends. It also illegally accessed data from the profiles of their Facebook friends.What was the data used for?Cambridge Analytica boasts that the Facebook data helped develop psychological profiles of users and votes, which was subsequently used to influence them. This reportedly had a greater impact on voters than traditional advertising.Read | How much can you tell from a Facebook ‘like’? A lot, in fact What has Facebook said?Facebook is under immense pressure from authorities following Channel 4’s investigation. It has drawn criticism for its inaction in protecting users’ privacy. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned by a British parliamentary media committee to explain the company’s position. Facebook Inc’s shares have fallen up to 17 per cent over the controversy — they were on Monday trading at the cheapest since the company’s initial public offering nearly six years ago, according to Reuters. The company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value in the last two days.In a statement, FB said, “The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”Read | WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton tweets: Time to delete FacebookBritain, meanwhile, has expressed concern over the allegations. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May stated: “The allegations are clearly very concerning. It is essential that people can have confidence that their personal data will be protected and used in an appropriate way. So it is absolutely right that the Information Commissioner is investigating this matter. We expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.”Will this impact Mueller’s probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections?Special Counsel Robert Mueller believes the revelations can help determining Russian interference in the US elections. According to The Wall Street Journal, Mueller has requested Cambridge Analytica to “turn over documents as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election”.Does this have any bearing in India?In India, SCL partners with a company called Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), which is owned by Amrish Tyagi, son of the senior JD(U) leader K C Tyagi. The company lists BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (United) as its political clients. Strategic Communications Laboratories Private Limited, an Indian company based out of Ghaziabad, counts both Tyagi and Nix as its directors.Tyagi has said that queries regarding Channel 4’s investigation should be directed to Cambridge Analytica.(With inputs from agencies)","header":"Q\u0026A: What is the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook controversy all about?","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:07:14.952Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

Experts have pointed to the importance of aspects such as following basic cyber hygiene and a periodic review of the security facets of one’s profile on various web platforms, especially on social media, where users tend to share personal information.In a post on Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, while explaining how the data was misused pointed out how, in 2013, “a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends’ data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data”. While Zuckerberg claimed that since then Facebook has overtime changed the way it platform functions to “dramatically limit the data apps could access”, it could not stop the breach of trust by Kogan, who had shared the data collected through his apps with Cambridge Analytica.“ But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that,” Zuckerberg said in his statement.EXPLAINED | Facebook Chief Mark Zuckerberg’s promises fix: What he said, what he did notIn a set of queries by The Indian Express, legal firm Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC) said: “Everyone cares about their privacy. After all, you wouldn’t leave your door open and you would not hand out your address along with a picture of your family to strangers on the street, so why should it be any different on the internet? A big issue is that people do not understand the consequences of handing out bits of information about themselves – their profession, interests, friends, families, location, what kind of books, music and movies they like, do they like to drink coffee or tea, and so on”.Read | Read | How to check which apps have access to your account“These bits of information along with things that people do not explicitly mention – such as what time of the day they prefer to use a service and what words they search for – come together to form a very detailed picture about them. Quite often, this picture is more detailed than what your own spouse may know about you. The consequences of being profiled in this manner are unknown to most people,” SFLC added.The legal firm also detailed few precautions that users must adhere to while using social media platforms. These include:* Before you upload anything on the internet, think about whether it is acceptable for you to have that information, image, video, or voice clip available to everyone forever. That should be your basic filter for deciding whether or not you want to upload that thing in the first place.* Certain social media profiles are meant to generate and maintain a large following. For everyone else, what makes the most sense is to set your profile to private, so that only those people who have been explicitly granted permission to view your profile and your posts would be able to do so.* You should periodically review the privacy and security settings of your social media accounts. Having a strong password and setting up two-factor authentication are steps in this direction, but security does not end there. It is not a matter of setting it up once and then forgetting about it. Remove any device that you do not recognise from your list of logged in or authorised devices.Also read: Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data leaks controversy: Key developments to keep in mind* Be highly selective about which apps and websites you connect to your social media accounts. Grant them access to your account only if the access is absolutely essential for the core function(s) of that app or website. Remove any connected app and website from your social media account as soon as possible.However, experts have also argued that the rapid growth of cyber threats, which grow in line with the rise in technology, makes it nearly impossible for one to achieve 100 per cent security. “This is not the first time that a data breach has happened and certainly not the last time. When it comes to cybersecurity, there is no such thing as ‘100 per cent guarantee’ or ‘all steps taken to block any future data leak incidents’. Having said that, it is very important that governments and private players give the due importance to the data it has of citizens. They should repeat audits every year, if not every six months, as only full transparency will restore trust back in this system, else more bad news is likely to come,” said Altaf Halde, Global Business Head of cyber security firm Network Intelligence.The need for a timely implementation of the data protection legislation in India has been underscored at a time when a massive breach of user information has been exposed at Facebook, including alleged involvement in the electoral process. While the preparation of the law is in its final stages before it is taken to the Parliament, the concept of having a comprehensive legal instrument for data protection has been in the works since 2010.In July last year, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology constituted a committee under retired Supreme Court judge Justice BN Srikrishna to identify key data protection issues in India and recommend methods of addressing them. The panel came out with a white paper on data protection in November seeking public comments on the structure of the data protection law, and in December came out with a schedule for holding public consultations across the country ending in January.Currently, data protection in India is governed by provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2008 under Sections 43-A and 72A. Compensation for failure to protect data (Section 43-A) was introduced by way of an amendment in 2008, which lays down the liability of a body/corporate to compensate in case of negligence in maintaining and securing the “sensitive data.” However, the Act does not define “sensitive data” and states the same as “personal information as may be prescribed by the Central government.”“In today’s age, detailed profiles can be created using only personal data or information, without knowing any sensitive personal information. In an ideal data protection framework, all personal data would need to be protected with a high standard. Without any deterrent in place, there is currently no legal reason for any organisation to provide any protection for personal data or information…. A proper data protection law with an effective enforcement mechanism would ensure recognition for India as a trustworthy global destination for data-based businesses and privacy-conscious consumers while also protecting the Right to Privacy of the people in India,” SFLC told this newspaper.\nPranav Mukul... read more","header":"Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data leaks: A wake-up call","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:07:33.067Z"},"time":"\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n\n"}

Aleksandr Kogan, who created a personality quiz on Facebook to harvest information later used by Cambridge Analytica, established his own commercial enterprise, Global Science Research (GSR). That firm was granted access to large-scale public Twitter data, covering months of posts, for one day in 2015, according to Twitter.“In 2015, GSR did have one-time API access to a random sample of public tweets from a five-month period from December 2014 to April 2015,” Twitter said in a statement to Bloomberg. “Based on the recent reports, we conducted our own internal review and did not find any access to private data about people who use Twitter.” The company has removed Cambridge Analytica and affiliated entities as advertisers. Twitter said GSR paid for the access; it provided no further details.Explanations NeededTwitter provides certain companies, developers and users with access to public data through its application programming interfaces (APIs), or software that requests and delivers information. The company sells the data to organizations, which often use them to analyze events, sentiment or customer service. Enterprise customers are given the broadest data access, which includes the last 30 days of tweets or access to tweets from as far back as 2006.

Social media companies have come under intense scrutiny over reports that Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users. Companies like Twitter tend to have access to less private information than Facebook. The latter has said that Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, may have harvested data on 87 million users.Personality QuizAbout 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s personality quiz app, which shared information the people and their friends that was then improperly passed to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has testified in front of Congress about the misuse of data, and lawmakers have called on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify as well.Criticism of Twitter’s failure to prevent misinformation and abuse on its platform has risen since the 2016 election. In the first quarter, the company removed more than 142,000 applications connected to the Twitter API that was collectively responsible for more than 130 million ‘low-quality’ tweets during the period.

The company is also accused of using personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the results of the 2016 US Presidential elections and UK Brexit referendum.Analytica has decided to cease all operations and appoint insolvency practitioner Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP to act as the independent administrator for the firm. Simultaneously, the statement said, the two firms have agreed to commence bankruptcy proceedings as it has lost several clients and faces legal proceedings in the wake of the controversy.“Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the statement said.While denying any wrongdoing, the company said that it is the negative media coverage which has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees, thus forcing it to shut down operations. “Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers. As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration,” the company added.The data leak came to light after Channel 4 aired an undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, sharing examples of how the firm was capable of influencing voters across the world through tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. Following this, Nix was suspended “with immediate effect pending a full, independent investigation”. “In the view of the board, Mr Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” the company’s statement said last month.However, the chair of a UK Parliament committee which is probing the firm’s activities expressed concerns over the decision of the two firms to shut down. “They are party to very serious investigations and those investigations cannot be impeded by the closure of these companies,” MP Damian Collins said.“I think it’s absolutely vital that the closure of these companies is not used as an excuse to try and limit or restrict the ability of the authorities to investigate what they were doing,” he added.According to Facebook, data of up to 87 million of its users was harvested by an app and later shared with the political consultancy. The social network said its own investigation into the case would continue. On Tuesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed that the company will build its way out of its worst-ever privacy debacle and reiterated that the social networking site is investing a lot in security and in strengthening its systems to ensure they are exploited to meddle with during the elections, including the US midterms later this year.Cambridge Analytica is a part of SCL Group, a government and military contractor that says it works on everything from food security research to counter-narcotics to political campaigns. SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.

In a press release, the firm went opened up to confirming that they will shut down with immediate effect.On May 2, 2018, SCL Elections Ltd., as well as certain of its and Cambridge Analytica LLC’s UK affiliates filed applications to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK.  The Company is immediately ceasing all operations and the boards have applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP to act as the independent administrator for Cambridge Analytica. Additionally, parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and certain of the Company’s US affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.  In light of those accusations, noted Queen’s Counsel Julian Malins was retained to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations regarding the Company’s political activities. Malins report, which the Company posted on its website, concluded that the allegations were not “borne out by the facts.” Regarding the conclusions set forth in his report, Malins stated:“I had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report.  My findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked.  Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.”Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by Malins’ report, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.  As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.While this decision was extremely painful for Cambridge Analytica’s leaders, they recognise that it is all the more difficult for the Company’s dedicated employees who learned that they likely would be losing their jobs as a result of the damage caused to the business by the unfairly negative media coverage.  Despite the Company’s precarious financial condition, Cambridge Analytica intends to fully meet its obligations to its employees, including with respect to notice periods, severance terms, and redundancy entitlements.Click on Deccan Chronicle Technology and Science for the latest news and reviews.

However, Twitter doesn’t have vast data access of its users similar to Facebook and henceforth this breach appears not to be a major privacy issue.(Source)Click on Deccan Chronicle Technology and Science for the latest news and reviews.

Notice has gone from the Indian government to the two companies. We should wait for their reply. We will take action after their reply,\" Prasad told reporters. Following up on its earlier warning, the IT Ministry on Wednesday issued a notice to social networking giant Facebook seeking its response over the user data breach and details of the measures it has put in place to ensure safety and prevent misuse of personal data.Also read: Share information on data breach by April 7: Govt notice to FacebookThe ministry raised five questions for Facebook, including whether the personal data of Indian voters and users has been compromised by Cambridge Analytica or any other downstream entity in any manner, and gave the networking giant a deadline of April 7 to send detailed response.It questioned whether the company or its related or downstream agencies utilising the data on the social media platform have previously been engaged by any entity \"to manipulate the Indian electoral process\".The letter sent to Facebook noted that it has largest footprint in India in terms of user base and sought its reply on proactive measures being taken by the company to ensure safety, security and privacy of such large user data and to prevent its misuse by any third party.A similar notice was earlier sent to Cambridge Analytica over media reports about questionable practices attributed to the UK-based firm in their efforts to influence elections by harvesting data of Facebook users.Also read: Data breach unacceptable: Govt notice to Cambridge Analytica over FacebookPrasad further said that a UK parliamentary committee is conducting an investigation and added that he did not wish to comment on the views of one of its members.\"I will not comment on that.

CEO Alexander Nix’s comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for Facebook Inc as it faces lawmakers’ scrutiny in the United States and Europe over Cambridge Analytica’s improper use of 50 million Facebook users’ personal data to target voters.The social media network’s shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 per cent, as investors worried that its dealings with Cambridge Analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. The company has lost nearly $50 billion of its stock market value over the last two days. Cambridge Analytica’s board of directors suspended Nix on March 20, shortly before the second part of British broadcaster Channel 4’s expose of the firm’s methods. In the program, Nix describes questionable practices used to influence foreign elections and said his firm did all the research, analytics and targeting of voters for Trump’s digital and TV campaigns. He also boasts he met Trump when he was the Republican presidential candidate “many times.”Nix’s comments “do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on March 20. Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign’s main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Nix’s claims. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and now a senior adviser, oversaw the Trump campaign’s digital operations. One former Trump adviser said Kushner brought Cambridge Analytica into the 2016 campaign effort. Kushner’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Washington Post on Tuesday that in 2014 conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who would go on to be Trump's White House adviser, oversaw the firm's early efforts to collect Facebook data to build detailed profiles on millions of American voters.Bannon approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014, Wylie told the Post. It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the Facebook data, the Post reported.Bannon, who served on Cambridge Analytica’s board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. US law bans foreigners from making contributions or spending money on behalf of a US election campaign but it was not illegal for the Trump campaign to retain Cambridge Analytica’s services, according to Bradley Smith, a former Republican member of the US Federal Election Commission.“The fact that they are a British company doesn’t add anything to the analysis unless they were giving their services away for free or charging below-market rates,” said Smith, now a professor at the Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio.FTC Review, LawsuitUS and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the leading US consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.“The entire company is outraged we were deceived,” Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.”The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.Facebook was also hit on March 20 in a San Francisco court by the first of what could be many lawsuits by shareholders claiming to suffer losses because the company misled them about its ability to protect user data. The company could also soon face lawsuits on behalf of users whose personal information was exposed. Facebook and its peers Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter already face a backlash from users and lawmakers over their role during the US presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward Trump.Fear of increased regulation hurt other social media firms on March 20. Shares of Snap Inc fell 2.5 per cent and Twitter fell more than 10 per cent.Foreign influenceUS Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on TuesdayMarch 20 for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in Congress. Congressional staff said the company would brief US Senate and House aides on March 21.A Congressional official said House Intelligence Committee Democrats plan to interview Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Wylie. The committee interviewed Nix by video teleconference, according to the Congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged Russian interference in US politics and a detailed examination of US election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of Cambridge Analytica, a Congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said.The White House said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that Americans’ privacy should be protected.","header":"\nCambridge Analytica CEO claims influence on US election, Facebook questioned\n","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:13:37.469Z"},"time":"CriticsUnion10 Indian Divas Who Never Got MarriedCriticsUnion"}

Will do.\"Facebook pages of SpaceX and Tesla, which had millions of followers, are no longer accessible.Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have borne the brunt of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The Fortune 500 company's shares have tanked 14 per cent, wiping out US$50 billion (S$66 billion) in market value, ever since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.Mr Zuckerberg was one of the billionaires worst hurt in a wider stock market rout as well.The slide in his company's share price wiped out US$10.3 billion of his personal wealth and he dropped three places to seventh in ranking on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Ever since news of the data breach broke, tech companies have been particularly hard hit in the stock market as investors worry that the government could impose regulations on the entire social media industry.The Malaysian government had to issue a denial that it ever hired Cambridge Analytica after a secretly recorded video by Britain's Channel 4 News showed the firm's officials saying they have used a web of shell companies to disguise their activities in elections.According to Cambridge Analytica's website, the firm \"supported Barisan Nasional in Kedah state with a targeted messaging campaign highlighting their school improvements since 2008\".Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's office also said SCL has informed the government that \"Cambridge Analytica's advice on the 2013 general election was provided personally to Mukhriz Mahathir\", former Kedah menteri besar and the son of former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad. Mr Mukhriz has denied receiving any analysis, data or advice from the firm.Cambridge Analytica's alleged role in elections in Kenya, Brazil and India has also raised eyebrows.Kenya's ruling Jubilee party has acknowledged it paid for \"branding\" in the 2017 presidential election from SCL.

I am quite comfortable standing by the statements that I made.\"Nix denied a story in the Financial Times that he had withdrawn US$8 million (S$10.6 million) from Cambridge Analytica before its collapse last month.Asked about a Guardian report that a Cambridge Analytica employee visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2017, he said he had been unaware of the meeting.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Cambridge Analytica is said to have exploited the data for commercial and political use.Facebook's chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer said in an update on Wednesday that the total number of people who had their information improperly obtained and shared is now estimated to be 87 million, 37 million more than its initial figure of 50 million people.The bulk of the affected accounts belong to North American Facebook users, which currently stand at over 70 million accounts which had their data compromised.NOT SO EASYI would love to delete Facebook, but I can't because of how deeply embedded social media has become for us in society.STUDENT WANG XI YUThe Philippines is next on the list, with 1.17 million affected users, followed by Indonesia with 1.09 million and Britain with 1.08 million.Singapore's Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) is looking into the matter, said a spokesman.\"PDPC is concerned that individuals in Singapore are affected. We are looking into the matter and are in close contact with Facebook,\" the spokesman added. \"Facebook users are encouraged to review their privacy settings in order to control how their information is used or shared.\"From Monday, Facebook will also notify users, through a link on their accounts, if they were among those who have had their information shared with Cambridge Analytica.Mr Evan Dumas, regional director for South-East Asia at cyber-security firm Check Point, said that although the incident has reduced consumer trust in Facebook, people \"continue to trade privacy for convenience\".\"The reality is we haven't hit an inflection point where consumer confidence is low enough to affect change,\" he said.And indeed, when asked about the effects of a campaign to get users to delete their accounts, Facebook chief Mark Zucker-berg said: \"I don't think there has been any meaningful impact that we observed.\"Similarly, Facebook users here also appear unfazed about the company's treatment of the issue.

According to the Guardian, the firm collects data from a wide range of sources, including social media platforms such as Facebook, and its own polling.It was set up in 2013 as an offshoot of its British parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories Group (SCL), a government and military contractor that says it works on everything from food security research to counter-narcotics to political campaigns. SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.CA was created initially with a focus on US elections, with US$15 million (S$19.7 million) in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.According to its website, CA has offices in New York, Washington DC, London, Brazil and Malaysia.CA came under media scrutiny after The New York Times and The Guardian's Observer reported on Saturday (March 17) that the firm harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support US President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016.After the news reports broke, US and British lawmakers demanded on Sunday (March 18) that Facebook explain how the firm was able to harvest personal information without the social network’s alerting users.The newspapers, which cited former CA employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook. It subsequently led to US and European officials questioning Facebook's protection of personal data.US senators have called on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how Facebook will protect users.Attorneys-general from the US states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have also launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney-general’s office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.The UK Information Commissioner’s Office is also pursuing a warrant to search CA's office in London.The BBC reported on Tuesday (March 20) that the head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused, and a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said she was \"very concerned\" about the revelations.In response, Facebook has suspended CA after finding data privacy policies had been violated. The move means the firm and its parent group SCL cannot buy advertisements or administer pages belonging to clients.In the latest revelation, Britain’s Channel 4 News reported on Monday (March 19), based on secretly recorded video, that CA secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta’s campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. CA has denied the report.The Observer said CA used the data, taken without authorisation in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.It quoted whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped set up the firm and worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalised political advertisements.The more than 50 million profiles represented about a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters, at the time, the Observer said.The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former CA employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it.The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University.Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with CA, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said.However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers' Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer added.It said Facebook's \"platform policy\" allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising.Facebook said it was pressing CA for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. The social media giant has also hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help.While Facebook investigates, it said it has acted against CA, its parent group SCL, Kogan and Wylie after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared.The firm's part-owner Robert Mercer is a key Trump supporter and donor who gave US$15 million in funding to CA.Mercer, who also funded the right-wing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trump's election campaign and then served as his chief strategist.Trump's campaign hired CA in June 2016 and paid it more than US$6.2 million (S$8.2 million), according to Federal Election Commission records.On its website, CA says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\"The company, which was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign before helping Trump’s.The company was also mentioned by a security expert last week during a public hearing by Singapore's parliamentary Select Committee that is looking into how Singapore can tackle deliberate online falsehoods.Dr Shashi Jayakumar of the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies cited the firm last Thursday when he warned that Singapore's close neighbours may already be seeing disinformation tactics being deployed internally. Those tactics, he said, could well be turned on Singapore if relations were to fray.Dr Shashi said that the firm now has a presence in polls-bound Malaysia, where it is thought to be hired \"by people involved in the coming election\".SOURCES: REUTERS, NYTIMES, THE GUARDIAN, BBCWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

US senators also called on Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress.Attorneys-general from the US states of Massachusetts and Connecticut launch investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the UK Information Commissioner's Office is also pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office in London.Britain's Channel 4 News reports that, based on secretly recorded video, Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. The firm proceeded to deny the report.Facebook's chief of security Alex Stamos announced that his role has shifted to focusing on emerging risks and election security at the global social network after the New York Times reported he was leaving Facebook in the wake of internal clashes over how to deal with Russian actors using the platform to spread false or exaggerated stories to cause division among US voters.The BBC reported that the head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused, and a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said she was \"very concerned\" about the revelations.Cambridge Analytica suspends its chief executive Alexander Nix after broadcaster Channel 4 aired a second undercover video in which he claims the firm's online campaign played a decisive role in Trump's 2016 election victory.Malaysia's ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) becomes embroiled in the scandal as the opposition questioned Prime Minister Najib Razak's role in using the big data firm to score wins in the country's 2013 polls. But the administration has denied employing the firm, and said any services were provided personally to former BN leader turned opposition politician Mukhriz Mahathir.Shareholders sued Facebook in San Francisco federal court in a class action, saying that they suffered losses after the data privacy violations disclosure.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opens an investigation into whether Facebook violated an 2011 consent decree with the agency on data privacy.A lawyer for Christopher Wylie confirms that he plans to accept an invitation from the US House Intelligence Committee Democrats to give an interview, as part of their effort to continue to investigate Russian interference in the election, including possible ties to the Trump campaign.Facebook take steps to prevent what it calls fake news during Mexico's presidential campaign. It placed full-page ads in prominent Mexican newspapers, including El Financiero, under the title \"Tips To Detect Fake News\".Cambridge University psychology academic Aleksandr Kogan appears in a CNN interview and says he had been made a scapegoat by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and that the accuracy of the dataset had been exaggerated and was more likely to hurt Trump's campaign.Fears of increased regulation over social media firms triggered market sell-off of technology stocks like Facebook, Snap and Twitter.Facebook's shares tumbled more than 9 per cent in the past week, losing US$60 billion (S$79 billion) of its stock market value since the scandal broke.SOURCES: REUTERS, BLOOMBERG, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, NYTIMES, BBCWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Quartz is owned by Atlantic Media, publisher of The Atlantic, National Journal and Government Executive.In total, SCL claims to have worked on more than 100 election campaigns across 32 countries, Quartz reported. Previous media reports say these included claims that it had helped political parties in Malaysia, India, Kenya and Brazil.In Indonesia, according to the SCL documents, the firm went on to survey thousands of Indonesians, manage communications for politicians and even organise large rallies at universities to help students \"let off steam\".SCL said it was tasked with managing growing frustration with the new administration of president B.J. Habibie and surveyed 72,000 of the country's 220 million people.In Indonesia in 1998, SCL said it decided to sponsor \"organised avenues of protests\" to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations. But Indonesia expert Ian Wilson of Australia's Murdoch University said claims that SCL helped to curb violence were an \"exaggeration\".The documents seen by Quartz show that the younger \"university\" age group mainly instigated the unrest, while the older generation was wary of insubordination, having been suppressed for so long.SCL decided to focus on 18-to 25-year-old Indonesians and direct their frustration away from civil unrest. Research in schools and universities found many of them were unhappy about the increased police and military presence on the streets.SCL made the decision to sponsor \"organised avenues of protests\" to draw in students and keep them away from violent demonstrations - apparently with the cooperation of the Indonesian government.\"This was achieved by establishing a rally committee and financing activities and coverage across the country,\" the SCL documents said.\"The events were so large that there was a general feeling among students that their voice really had been heard.\"SCL claims its methods dramatically reduced civil unrest and convinced then President Habibie to step down, leading to the 1999 polls that brought Mr Abdurrahman Wahid to power. The documents, Quartz said, indicate SCL ran the election campaign of Mr Abdurrahman's National Awakening Party.Indonesia expert Ian Wilson, a lecturer at Australia's Murdoch University, said claims that SCL helped to curb violence were an \"exaggeration\".\"It would have been, at most, one small element among all that were taking place at the time,\" he told Quartz. \"The forces and interests at play and jostling for influence were simply on too big a scale to have been influenced significantly in such a way.\"The SCL documents say the company entered Thailand some time before the 2001 elections that saw telecoms billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra taking power.SCL was tasked with gauging the scale of vote-buying behaviour that had inflated the cost of an election campaign to an estimated US$1 billion (S$1.3 billion).\"Vote buying had become so endemic that an entire industry of dealers had emerged to broker the voter groups and funders,\" the documents said, as quoted by Quartz.\"It was quite commonplace for voters to sell their votes twice - and then not vote at all!\"SCL claimed to have employed more than 1,200 staff who collected data from over nine months and found that in half of the constituencies, vote buying did not impact the electoral result, a discovery that the company claimed was worth US$250 million alone.However, in the other constituencies \"a more direct behavioural intervention was required\", which the SCL papers suggested could involve \"social pressure, economic penalties, legal framework and enhanced monitoring\".SCL said it intervened for six months, apparently with \"the cooperation of most of the major political parties\", and Thaksin went on to win the 2001 election.Thailand expert and University of Leeds professor Duncan McCargo told Quartz: \"There's no doubt that some Thai political parties have commissioned international consultants to work on improving their electability, and this was certainly the case for Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party in 2001.\"He was sceptical, however, that different parties could have supported a project to stop vote buying. \"The 1997 Constitution included various provisions designed to combat and reduce vote buying,\" he explained. \"There was broad popular support for these changes, though I can't say that translates to 'cross-party' support.\"Quartz said it had contacted CA and SCL for comment.We have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.

It is now facing a government search of its London office, questions from US state authorities, and a demand by Facebook that it submit to a forensic audit.Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.READ MORE HEREThe 42-year-old impeccably-dressed chief executive of Cambridge Analytica now finds himself at the centre of a data mining scandal that has ensnared social media giant Facebook.The firm suspended him after British broadcaster Channel 4 aired another undercover video on Tuesday (March 20), in which Nix claims his UK-based political consultancy's online campaign played a decisive role in Trump's 2016 election victory.In the programme meant to expose the firm's dirty methods, Nix described questionable practices used to influence foreign elections and said his firm did all the research, analytics and targeting of voters for Trump's digital and TV campaigns. He also boasted that he met Trump when he was the Republican presidential candidate \"many times.\"Nix also acknowledged his company used a self-destructing email server to communicate with clients in order to eliminate evidence of their contact.READ MORE HEREKogan, 32, moved to the United States from Russia as a child and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 2008 with a degree in psychology before moving to Hong Kong for his doctorate. He ultimately joined Cambridge University in 2012, where he remains a research associate in the psychology department, a position he has retained since relocating back to the San Francisco Bay area.His ill-fated detour from the academic track into the darker corners of social media marketing began in 2014 when Cambridge Analytica turned to him for help. The firm was interested in a data project Kogan had worked on at Cambridge University that was based on research into personality traits and social media.Kogan had created an app called 'thisisyourdigitallife' that offered Facebook users personality predictions, in exchange for accessing their personal data on the social network and more limited information about their friends - including their \"likes\" - if their privacy settings allowed it.Only about 270,000 people downloaded the app, but the researchers were able to mine the profiles of tens of millions of people through tools Facebook had at the time that gave third parties access to a wide swathe of information.After Kogan was implicated in the scandal, Cambridge University said it had no evidence to suggest that Kogan had used university resources or facilities for his GSR work.READ MORE HEREThe 28-year-old Canadian was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia as a child.

I am quite comfortable standing by the statements that I made.\"Nix denied a story in the Financial Times that he had withdrawn US$8 million from Cambridge Analytica before its collapse last month.Asked about a Guardian report that a Cambridge Analytica employee visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2017, he said he had been unaware of the meeting.(Editing by Stephen Addison and John Stonestreet)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"Ex-Cambridge Analytica boss admits getting Facebook data from researcher","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:18:13.466Z"},"time":null}

SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website.Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with US$15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported.Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm’s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a “secret sauce” it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia’s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive messages during the election.Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and Bill Rigby)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:18:41.189Z"},"time":null}

We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,\" the firm said.Cambridge Analytica's board said meanwhile that Nix would stand aside immediately pending an investigation into the snowballing allegations against him.\"In the view of the Board, Mr. Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" the company said.In Channel 4's recordings, Nix slights US representatives on the House Intelligence Committee to whom he gave evidence last year, claiming its Democrats are motivated by \"sour grapes\" and Republicans asked few questions.\"They're politicians, they're not technical. They don't understand how it works,\" he was caught on camera telling an undercover reporter.He also outlines the use of a secret self-destructing email system.\"There's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing,\" he said of the tool, which deletes emails two hours after they have been read.INVESTIGATIONS MULTIPLYChannel 4 News broadcast an interview filmed in October last year with defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in which she said she had faced \"a massive propaganda effort\".\"There was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side,\" she said. \"It affected the thought processes of voters.\"Facebook now faces investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, sending its share price tumbling another 2.6 per cent after a 6.8 per cent plunge Monday.European Union officials have called for an urgent investigation while British lawmakers have asked Zuckerberg to give evidence to a UK parliamentary committee.Zuckerberg has been asked to appear before the European Parliament.\"Facebook needs to clarify before the representatives of 500 million Europeans that personal data is not being used to manipulate democracy,\" tweeted parliament president Antonio Tajani.US lawmakers have also called on Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the chief executives of Twitter and Google.Officials in the US states of Massachusetts and New York announced they were sending a \"demand letter\" to Facebook for the facts of the case.\"Consumers have a right to know how their information is used - and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users' personal information,\" New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.Thirteen US consumer and privacy organizations meanwhile released a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to reopen a probe into Facebook, saying the firm's admission so far \"suggests a clear violation\" of a 2011 consent decree.WATCHDOG SEARCHESA former Cambridge Analytica employee says it was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends - as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time.The end goal was to create software to predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box.The company blames the academic who developed the app, University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, for misusing the data, which it says was never used on the Trump campaign, and has in any event been deleted.But the firm's reputation took a severe hit on Monday, with the broadcast of a first batch of secret footage showing Nix saying it could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and sex workers.He also said the firm secretly campaigns in elections around the world, including by operating through a web of shadowy front companies, or by using sub-contractors, according to Channel 4 News.A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told the news programme it does not use \"untrue material for any purpose\".Facebook, which says the data was taken without its knowledge, has launched its own investigation into Cambridge Analytica.But it was forced to suspend its probe following a request from Britain's information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is making her own inquiries into both companies.Denham's office said it had yet to obtain a court warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers, and was now expecting to secure it on Wednesday.It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"Data firm Cambridge Analytica suspends CEO over Facebook scandal","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:19:06.565Z"},"time":null}

However, they have since retracted their claims, saying no contract was signed and no work was completed.Parliament is investigating the links between Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU as part of an investigation into fake news.Did Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU work together?Arron Banks, the co-founder of Leave.EU, said in a book that in October 2015 his group hired Cambridge Analytica, a company that uses \"big data and advanced psychographics\" to influence people. In a November 2015, Leave.EU said on its website that Cambridge Analytica \"will be helping us map the British electorate and what they believe in, enabling us to better engage with voters\".In the same month, Cambridge Analytica director Brittany Kaiser spoke at a Leave.EU news conference. She said her organisation would be \"running large-scale research of the nation to really understand why people are interested in staying in or out of the EU\".In February 2016, Cambridge Analytica chief executive  Alexander Nix wrote in Campaign magazine that his company was working for Leave.EU. \"We have already helped supercharge Leave.EU's social media campaign by ensuring the right messages are getting to the right voters online,\" said Nix, who was suspended by the company this week.Leave.EU's communications director Andy Wigmore also said on Twitter last year that his campaign group had used the company. \"You should use Cambridge Analytics,\" he said, adding that he could \"highly recommend them\".What does Leave.EU say now?Banks says Cambridge Analytica sought work with the Leave.EU before the referendum but that ultimately it never did any - paid or otherwise - for the campaign.\"We did have dealings with Cambridge Analytica – they put forward a pitch that went into the designation document submitted to the electoral commission,\" Banks told Reuters.No work was done with Cambridge Analytica because Leave.EU did not win the designation as the official leave campaign and due to concerns about the consultancy, Banks said.When asked if Leave.EU paid or accepted any services from Cambridge Analytica, Banks said: \"No benefit in kind, no data, no nothing.\"Banks told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that when he referred to Cambridge Analytica being \"hired\" in his book this was a reference to the intention to work them.What does Cambridge Analytica say now?Nix told a parliamentary committee last month that he contacted Banks and Wigmore and their statements were not true.The article written in the Campaign magazine was a mistake and \"drafted by a slightly overzealous PR consultant\", he said.This \"referenced work that we hoped and intended to undertake for the campaign.

Bannon left the White House on August 2017.(Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Peter Cooney)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"US investigating Cambridge Analytica - New York Times","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:20:14.170Z"},"time":null}

I could have lost with that,\" Duterte told reporters.(Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Martin Petty and Eric Meijer)It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.","header":"Philippines' watchdog probes Facebook over Cambridge Analytica data breach","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:20:37.732Z"},"time":null}

The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a secret sauce it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive messages during the election.Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm,and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.Reuters\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down\n        ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:23:27.036Z"},"time":"Bored ArticlesThe Top 10 Best Countries To Buy A House \u0026 Invest In Real EstateBored Articles"}

The company, which the Times said was staffed mostly by British workers then, assisted US Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign before helping Trump's.Cambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Facebook's latest privacy scandal a \"danger signal\".She wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on security measures that protect people's privacy - or Congress may step in.Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads.Wylie has agreed to be interviewed by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.In footage released Monday, Nix said the company could \"send some girls\" around to a rival candidate's house, suggesting that girls from Ukraine are beautiful and effective.He also said the company could \"offer a large amount of money\" to a rival candidate and have the whole exchange recorded so it could be posted on the internet to show that the candidate was corrupt.Also on Tuesday, a dozen consumer-advocacy organizations pressed the US Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the release of data violated an agreement Facebook signed with the FTC in 2011.Facebook shares fell as much as 5.2 percent to $175.41 Monday.

Cambridge's clients included Donald Trump's general-election campaign.Facebook shares have dropped some 8 percent, lopping about $46 billion off the company's market value, since the revelations were first published.Even before the scandal broke, Facebook has already taken the most important steps to prevent a recurrence, Zuckerberg said. For example, in 2014, it reduced access outside apps had to user data. However, some of the measures didn't take effect until a year later, allowing Cambridge to access the data in the intervening months.Zuckerberg acknowledged that there is more to do.In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said it will ban developers who don't agree to an audit. An app's developer will no longer have access to data from people who haven't used that app in three months. Data will also be generally limited to user names, profile photos and email, unless the developer signs a contract with Facebook and gets user approval.In a separate post, Facebook said it will inform people whose data was misused by apps. Facebook first learned of this breach of privacy more than two years ago, but hadn't mentioned it publicly until Friday.The company said it was \"building a way\" for people to know if their data was accessed by \"This Is Your Digital Life,\" the psychological-profiling quiz app that researcher Aleksandr Kogan created and paid about 270,000 people to take part in. Cambridge Analytica later obtained information from the app for about 50 million Facebook users, as the app also vacuumed up data on people's friends — including those who never downloaded the app or gave explicit consent.Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, has said one of the firm's goals was to influence people's perceptions by injecting content, some misleading or false, all around them. It's not clear whether Facebook would be able to tell users whether they had seen such content.Cambridge has shifted the blame to Kogan, which the firm described as a contractor. Kogan described himself as a scapegoat.Kogan, a psychology researcher at Cambridge University, told the BBC that both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have tried to place the blame on him, even though the firm ensured him that everything he did was legal.\"One of the great mistakes I did here was I just didn't ask enough questions,\" he said. \"I had never done a commercial project. I didn't really have any reason to doubt their sincerity. That's certainly something I strongly regret now.\"He said the firm paid some $800,000 for the work, but it went to participants in the survey.\"My motivation was to get a dataset I could do research on,\" he said. \"I have never profited from this in any way personally.\"Authorities in Britain and the United States are investigating.David Carroll, a professor at Parsons School of Design in New York who sued Cambridge Analytica in the U.K., said he was not satisfied with Zuckerberg's response, but acknowledged that \"this is just the beginning.\"He said it was \"insane\" that Facebook had yet to take legal action against Cambridge parent SCL Group over the inappropriate data use. Carroll himself sued Cambridge Friday to recover data on him that the firm had obtained.Sandy Parakilas, who worked in data protection for Facebook in 2011 and 2012, told a U.K. parliamentary committee Wednesday that the company was vigilant about its network security but lax when it came to protecting users' data.He said personal data including email addresses and in some cases private messages was allowed to leave Facebook servers with no real controls on how the data was used after that.\"The real challenge here is that Facebook was allowing developers to access the data of people who hadn't explicitly authorized that,\" he said, adding that the company had \"lost sight\" of what developers did with the data.AP\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          Facebook's Zuckerberg admits mistakes, but no apology\n        ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:24:56.223Z"},"time":"bright-world.infoTOP 8 BEAUTIFUL DOGS IN THE WORLDbright-world.info"}

Saying no to the latest in foreign invasive technology, as sensible as it seems now, hurt China's image several years back when the US' internet darlings could do no wrong.When Beijing blocked Facebook and Google, there was a great media hue and cry about \"freedom\", and barriers to trade, but almost no talk about how the Silicon Valley giants not only work hand in glove with the US' Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, but also serve as formidable intelligence agencies in their own right. Unlike their Beltway counterparts, the Bay Area operations spy on millions and rake in obscene profits with little or no congressional oversight.The Cambridge Analytica scandal is a perfect storm of politics, dirty tricks and data abuse; the way they took charge of Donald Trump's digital campaign is and shall remain a potent reminder of what goes wrong when the \"friends\" and \"likes\" of Facebook accounts are used to divide, confuse and disenchant large portions of the electorate.After years of hemming and hawing and foot-dragging on key question of keeping private data private, the latest flurry of half-apologies and last-minute public relations push does nothing to fix the core problem. The core business model of Facebook is collecting, exploiting and selling data, mainly to advertisers but nefarious political operators such as Cambridge Analytica are clients, too. Facebook's legal team keeps it one step ahead of the law, it has long ignored complaints about privacy violation, and it lacks adequate checks and balances to correct itself.Violation of privacy is key to Facebook's rise and imminent fall. It's what happens when a greedy company can't get enough and wants more and more and more, without concern for the privacy of others, without thinking through the consequences. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has gone to great lengths to curry favor with Beijing authorities, all to no avail. Chinese analysts rightly surmised that Facebook was a \"Trojan Horse\" that they could do without, despite every outward appearance of being a gift.As US first lady, Hillary Clinton trumpeted the expansion of the internet in China. Working as a freelance reporter during President Bill Clinton's Beijing visit in 1998, the bubbly enthusiasm for all things Silicon Valley was palpable within the US delegation and Hillary Clinton was at the center of it, courting young Chinese web users with memes of \"freedom\".As US secretary of state, she continued to pitch pretty words about free expression to promote the case for Facebook, ignorant or unconcerned about the fact that Facebook was making the world a less safe place. And as a candidate for president, Hilary Clinton was at times ruthless, deflecting fellow Democrat Bernie Sanders as her campaign availed itself of dodgily-sourced information, because in politics, information is power. Dirty data collected online, offline and even in hotel bedrooms by retired spies and sleuths helped produce the infamous Steele dossier.Call it blowback, call it karma, but the United States' leading internet evangelista got bit by the beast she was feeding during the home stretch of her run for president in 2016. She lost a race she had every reason to think she would win, a close race against what many said was a clownish opponent. The electoral process was tarnished by the very technology she trumpeted.Facebook advertisement interference and Facebook data abuse, some of it tentatively linked to Russia, is at the heart of the scandal. Since Hillary Clinton's spectacularly unexpected defeat, she has pointed fingers every which way, missing exhibit number one: Facebook. And though its stock has dropped precipitously, Facebook is still at large, still evading responsibility while claiming to be responsible, still gobbling up unexploited markets, still maximizing and monetizing its access to the world's secrets.Britain's Channel 4 exposé on Cambridge Analytica chillingly suggests that the marshalling and manipulation of Facebook data can swing an election even in the most mature democracies. If so, what chance do struggling democracies stand in withstanding information abuse and fake news from Facebook and the other internet giants?Facebook is yet to explain how the private preferences, likes, dislikes, friends and friends of friends and information profiles of some 50 million Facebook users became fodder for political skullduggery. Cambridge Analytica, co-founded by the maverick, and sometimes gleefully malicious election adviser Steve Bannon, was funded by right-wing computer engineer Robert Mercer, both Americans. But most of the work and day-to-day operations, including, apparently, the outsourcing of skullduggery, were based in Britain and staffed by non-Americans, which raises the question of foreign interference. Manipulated data and dirty tricks also tilted one of the most consequential polls in European history, the Brexit vote, heralding Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.There's an irony in the US government crying foul to foreign meddling in US elections when the US government has a history of meddling second to none. But the vulnerability of free and open societies to cash-driven influence-peddling has hit close to home. It raises the question of the role that a billionaire such as Mercer can play in throwing the outcome of a national election or plebiscite. If the US and Britain, two exemplars of modern democracy, can so quickly lose their way under the triple threat of targeted ads, divisive messaging and dirty tricks, what hope does anyone else have to withstand a similar onslaught?Recent revelations will almost certainly lead to more shockers, but the Cambridge Analytica data harvesting case is enough to validate the view of those who didn't want the likes of Facebook and Google colonizing and exploiting the information ecology of China. China can watch Facebook explode and collapse with a certain schadenfreude, but it's nothing to be smug about since China also has to wrestle with the issue of data security while taming the influence of homegrown internet giants.Internally, the US and China face similar challenges on how best to manage a vast information ecosystem, but for the moment at least, China can watch the Facebook smack-down with \"I told you so\".The author is a media researcher covering Asia politics.\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"A world safe from Facebook skullduggery","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:25:12.256Z"},"time":"bright-world.infoTOP 8 BEAUTIFUL DOGS IN THE WORLDbright-world.info"}

We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,\" the firm said.Cambridge Analytica's board said meanwhile that Nix would stand aside immediately pending an investigation into the snowballing allegations against him.\"In the view of the Board, Mr. Nix's recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" the company said.In Channel 4's recordings, Nix slights US representatives on the House Intelligence Committee to whom he gave evidence last year, claiming its Democrats are motivated by \"sour grapes\" and Republicans asked few questions.\"They're politicians, they're not technical. They don't understand how it works,\" he was caught on camera telling an undercover reporter.He also outlines the use of a secret self-destructing email system.\"There's no evidence, there's no paper trail, there's nothing,\" he said of the tool, which deletes emails two hours after they have been read.Investigations multiplyChannel 4 News broadcast an interview filmed in October last year with defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in which she said she had faced \"a massive propaganda effort\".\"There was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side,\" she said. \"It affected the thought processes of voters.\"Facebook now faces investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, sending its share price tumbling another 2.6 percent after a 6.8 percent plunge Monday.European Union officials have called for an urgent investigation while British lawmakers have asked Zuckerberg to give evidence to a UK parliamentary committee.Zuckerberg has been asked to appear before the European Parliament.\"Facebook needs to clarify before the representatives of 500 million Europeans that personal data is not being used to manipulate democracy,\" tweeted parliament president Antonio Tajani.US lawmakers have also called on Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the chief executives of Twitter and Google.Officials in the US states of Massachusetts and New York announced they were sending a \"demand letter\" to Facebook for the facts of the case.\"Consumers have a right to know how their information is used -- and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users' personal information,\" New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.Thirteen US consumer and privacy organizations meanwhile released a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to reopen a probe into Facebook, saying the firm's admission so far \"suggests a clear violation\" of a 2011 consent decree.Watchdog searchesA former Cambridge Analytica employee says it was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends -- as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time.The end goal was to create software to predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box.The company blames the academic who developed the app, University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, for misusing the data, which it says was never used on the Trump campaign, and has in any event been deleted.But the firm's reputation took a severe hit on Monday, with the broadcast of a first batch of secret footage showing Nix saying it could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and sex workers.He also said the firm secretly campaigns in elections around the world, including by operating through a web of shadowy front companies, or by using sub-contractors, according to Channel 4 News.A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told the news programme it does not use \"untrue material for any purpose\".Facebook, which says the data was taken without its knowledge, has launched its own investigation into Cambridge Analytica.But it was forced to suspend its probe following a request from Britain's information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is making her own inquiries into both companies.Denham's office said it had yet to obtain a court warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers, and was now expecting to secure it on Wednesday.","header":"Data firm suspends CEO over Facebook scandal","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:26:22.623Z"},"time":"Tech  March 21, 2018 06:54"}

Facebook shares, did, however increased 4.5 percent on Tuesday, their biggest gain in two years.Zuckerberg told the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees that he has not been personally interviewed by Mueller's team, but \"I know we're working with them.\" He offered no details, citing a concern about confidentiality rules of the investigation.Earlier this year, Mueller charged 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies in a plot to interfere in the 2016 presidential election through a social media propaganda effort that included online ad purchases using US aliases and politicking on US soil. A number of the Russian ads were on Facebook.During Tuesday's hearing, which at times was contentious, Zuckerberg said it had been \"clearly a mistake\" to believe the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had deleted user data that it had harvested in an attempt to sway elections.He said Facebook had considered the data collection \"a closed case\" because it thought the information had been discarded. Facebook also didn't alert the Federal Trade Commission, Zuckerberg said, and he assured senators the company would handle the situation differently today.He began a two-day congressional inquisition with a public apology for the way Facebook handled the data-mining of its users' data. He took responsibility for failing to prevent Cambridge Analytica, which was affiliated with Trump's presidential campaign, from gathering personal information from 87 million users.Separately, the company began alerting some of its users that their data was gathered by Cambridge Analytica. A notification that appeared on Facebook for some users Tuesday told them that \"one of your friends\" used Facebook to log into a now-banned personality quiz app called \"This Is Your Digital Life.\"The notice says the app misused the information such as public profiles, likes, birthdays and current cities, by sharing it with Cambridge Analytica.Zuckerberg is to testify Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told Zuckerberg his company had a 14-year history of apologizing for \"ill-advised decisions\" related to user privacy. \"How is today's apology different?\" Thune asked.\"We have made a lot of mistakes in running the company,\" Zuckerberg responded. \"I think it's pretty much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm room and then grow it to be at the scale that we're at now without making some mistakes.\"Zuckerberg said Facebook is going through \"a broader philosophical shift in how we approach our responsibility as a company\".Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said Zuckerberg's appearance marked the most intense hearing for a tech company since Microsoft, when its founder Bill Gates testified before Congress in March 1998.Many of the senators' questions seemed to focus on Facebook's basic functions, such as its privacy settings and what it does and doesn't do with user data. Because each of the 44 senators had five minutes to ask questions, there was little time for tough follow-ups.Associated Press\nEnglish|中文\n","header":"\n          Facebook working with Mueller, Zuckerberg tells Senate hearing\n        ","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:26:39.389Z"},"time":"TopManFunThe 15 Best Colleges for Your MoneyTopManFun"}

Putin himself has said he wants Russia to be THE global leader in this game-changing technology: Putin Gives Huge Endorsement to Blockchain, Vows State Support. We've created a dedicated section for the subject: Blockchain Superpower.The enthusiastic statements coming from Russia's top financial and government figures are in stark contrast to the exact opposite coming from Western financial mandarins. This makes sense, for blockchain technology, especially as it relates to crypto-currencies, is de-centralizing, transferring control of financial systems from elites to individuals, much the way the internet took control of information away from the wealthy, and made it accessible to everyone. This helps Russia and other developing countries break free from the financial straitjacket imposed by the West.Putin understands this, as do his advisors, which is why they are supportive. The existence of sites like Russia Insider are thanks to this trend, and now blockchain can help us defend our position against efforts by the 'establishment' to censor us.Russia's commanding position in blockchain forced us to start paying attention earlier than most, and many people whom we know and respect have been encouraging us to join STEEMIT, a blockchain platform designed to host media - print and video. Our regular contributor Tom Luongo is an expert on the crypto space. Here is his very positive article about STEEMIT which explains it in more detail.So we started publishing there. Here is our Home Page. We will also be loading videos onto the video part of the platform, called DTube.STEEMIT makes a very compelling case:1. It is censor-proof: Blockchain algorithms make what you post there permanent - once it is up, only you can take it down or edit it.2. It pays content creators in crypto-currency: The STEEMIT platform assigns value to content loaded on the platform, depending on how popular it is. The more content is viewed and upvoted, the more crypto-currency units (Steem Dollars) are assigned to the creator. This applies to both articles and, very importantly, comments.3. It is owned by the users: No Zuckerbergs earning billions off the backs of the masses. Nice.This solves a huge problem. Currently, millions, even billions of people create content, in the form of social media posts, articles on blogs, articles on websites like RI, and the people who reap the most financial gain from selling that info are the ones who own the platforms - Google, Facebook, etc. The creators get crumbs (sites like RI), or nothing at all (social media users). The current brouhaha around Facebook is essentially about this.STEEMIT proposes to cut out the middleman - monetary value goes directly to the creators with not only no gouging, but no charge at all. A brilliant idea. Here is a recent article about it on Bloomberg, and another good one from Zerohedge.And it seems to actually be working. Here is the traffic growth to STEEMIT for the last 6 months:And here is the recent exchange rate history of STEEM dollars:Due to this promise and initial success, a number of great journalists have joined STEEMIT, significantly increasing its credibility and user base. They include some sites and individuals we admire very much, like (all links to Steemit accounts) Ben Swann, Anti-Media, Max Keiser (Keiser Report), Jimmy Dore, Disobedient Media, Adam Kokesh, Tom Luongo, Lee Camp, Corbett Report, Patrick Lancaster, We Are Change (Luke Rudkowski), Slavix, Activist Post, Suzie Dawson (resident in Moscow no less), Inessa S, and Caitlin Johnstone.Here is Dawson explaining STEEMIT to followers:And these are just the tip of the iceberg. If some of the bigger alt-media players go on STEEM, like Zerohedge, RT, Wikileaks, the Chans, the Alt-Right, etc - you can see how this could snowball very quickly into a Faceberg killer. I detest Facebook because of its PC police who censor me and Russia Insider and if they are crushed by this next-wave technology, I couldn't be more delighted. We stay there out of necessity because it does provide some traffic, but I have all but stopped posting on my personal page. One definitely gets the feeling that Facebook is going the way of AOL.Faceberg's current Cambridge Analytica crisis is very bullish for new platforms like STEEM, so all the more reason to jump aboard now.How you can helpPlease do your best to share this article far and wide, but more importantly, please join STEEMIT, and follow us there, and all the folks mentioned above, and to the extent you can, comment, share and upvote there. We will be publishing some material there that will NOT be on the main site, and if this experiment delivers, will start publishing there before the main site. Every article on Steemit shows how much the creator has earned, so you can see for yourself if it is working. Ben Swann's page is a good example. Prices shown on STEEMIT are in STEEM dollars, which are trading at about $2 US, and have averaged around $5 over the last 4 months.As I mentioned above, comments also earn STEEM dollars, for both the commenter and the creator of the content being commented on. By commenting on STEEMIT you help yourself, and help RI.People are reporting a few days delay in receiving registration confirmation, but be patient, it does eventually arrive. If it doesn't, you can purchase a STEEMIT account using Anon Steem for about $20. Here is an article about it. Anon Steem has the advantage of being anonymous. The regular sign-up requires one to provide a telephone number.I will be speaking out in the coming weeks about how we all have to start doing more if we want to break the stranglehold the mainstream media have on the world, and the holocaust they are driving us into. Tweeting and sharing and talking isn't enough. We have to put significant resources into this. STEEMIT offers a way to do this without digging into your pocket.It is a lucky break, handed to us by the technology gods, and we should seize on it and see where it takes us.It might just be the solution we have been waiting for.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7ed2ab6dba1b08b5aacc16"},"url":"https://russia-insider.com/en/frontpage?page=45","content":"They seem to get along very well.Vladimir Putin made a bombshell claim during Monday's joint press conference with President Trump in Helsinki, Finland, when the Russian President said some $400 million in illegally earned profits was funneled to the Clinton campaign by associates of American-born British financier Bill Browder - at one time the largest foreign portfolio investors in Russia. The scheme involved members of the U.S. intelligence community, said Putin, who he said \"accompanied and guided these transactions.\"This is good entertainment, from the very admirable Max Blumenthal.Here's the background, from Sputnik:Beginning his joint press conference with Vladimir Putin, President Trump declared that U.S. relations with Russia have “never been worse.”He then added pointedly, that just changed “about four hours ago.”It certainly did. With his remarks in Helsinki and at the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump has signaled a historic shift in U.S. foreign policy that may determine the future of this nation and the fate of his presidency.The Vlad and Donald show in Helsinki Monday was simply brilliant and breathtaking – we’d say even a beautiful thing to behold.Between them, they left CNN’s nattering nabobs of neocon nonsense sounding like the shrieking monkeys they actually are. And that’s to say nothing of the fools they made out of the newly minted liberal and progressive warmongers on the Dem side of the aisle in Washington or the so-called journalists who fill 90% of the space in the so-called mainstream media with endless pro-war propaganda.Croatian defender Dejan Lovren has spoken of his anger at protesters claiming to be members of activist group Pussy Riot who stormed the pitch during the World Cup final, blaming them for disrupting the team’s rhythm in the match.Underdogs Croatia were 2-1 down to France and pushing for an equalizer when four members of the group stormed the pitch in the 52nd minute, forcing a halt in play while stewards attempted to remove the intruders.The reaction of the U.S. establishment media and several political leaders to President Donald Trump’s press conference after his summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday has been stunning.As I suspected, Trump’s meeting with Putin did indeed turn out to be a damp squib, at least relative to the unrealistic expectations that all sorts of strongly ideological camps had built up around it.The author is a prominent American social critic, blogger, and podcaster, and one of our all-time favorite pessimists. We carry his articles regularly on RI. His writing on Russia-gate has been highly entertaining.If there was ever any doubt that the Russia-gate hoax is a scheme by the War Party to salvage their bankrupt foreign policy, and depose a democratically-elected President, then Robert Mueller’s indictment of twelve alleged GRU agents for “interfering” in the 2016 election settles the matter once and for all.Show your support by disabling ad-block (How)Buy AD-FREE ACCESS here, for only $19 / yrThanks for your supportWe’re winning thanks to YOU!Disabling adblock for a specific site just takes a couple of clicks.Usually it is as simple as clicking on the adblock icon in your browser, and choosing the ‘disable on this page or domain’ option.If that doesn’t work this wikihow article gives more detail:  https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-AdBlockThank you for your support!(more info) Join us! | About | Contact | Investors | Crowdfunding | RSS\n\n","header":"Featured","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:28:40.692Z"},"time":null}

He can be reached at charles@russia-insider.com.  3600 wordsIntroductory note:This turned out to be very long, something regular readers will know I dislike, but there was no way to go shorter, as these are truly momentous times. I’ve tried to keep it organized by creating bolded sections.The stuff in the middle is a bit dry, explaining how we are going to manage this fund drive, and why alt-media in general is not successful in raising enough money, which you can circle back to if you like the other parts. The emotional harangue comes at the end along with some biographical information about me which readers might find interesting.Dear friends,Our Spring fund drive starts today, and I have decided to take a new approach, which I explain below.  DONATE NOW  But first, I want to talk to you about a big war with Russia, and the fact that I can see perfectly well, as do many others, that we Americans are marching straight into one.Please don't think that I am exaggerating what I write here for fundraising purposes. It really is this terrifying. This text should be littered with CAPITAL LETTERS AND EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!, except that's not my style. Please consider very carefully what I have to say this time.War is comingIf you have been following my site, you have no doubt noticed ever more ‘code red’ headlines.Signs of impending war are everywhere and unmistakable, and the smartest observers in the business, in the West and in Russia are saying so. I would direct you to The Saker's We're Headed To War With Russia, and No One Seems to Care and former assistant Treasury Secretary Paul Craig Roberts among US analysts, and Evgeny Satanovsky and Sergei Mikheyev among Russian ones for good examples.There has been so much great writing about this from the best sites and authors over the past two weeks that we have had to create a new category on Russia Insider, entitled, 'War Is Coming'. There are already 19 articles in there from the past 2 weeks, which have a couple hundred thousand views, and thousands of comments. See for yourself.If this doesn't alarm you, you aren't paying attention.The false flag poisonings, trumped-up diplomatic expulsions, the rampant deceit and propaganda that have completely overtaken the media, announcements of new weapons systems by Russia, the installation of a war-cabinet in Washington, the move to crack down on gun ownership in America, increasing US rhetoric about the need for military action against Iran, Chinese statements of solidarity with Russia, ratcheting up censoring of alternative media, Trump’s insistence that he needs a bigger military budget and his willingness to sacrifice everything he ran on to get it. I could go on, but I think you get the point. It has been a disastrous 3 weeks.Many of these things, especially on the propaganda side, are what you do in preparation for war. It is the information equivalent of massing troops and equipment at your opponent's border.We are being frog-marched to war by our media and certain factions in our deep state. The UK government and intelligence services are taking the lead. It is all very ominous.It’s a media problemWe have no one to blame but ourselves - the people who on the one hand create, and on the other hand, consume the alternative media. We have not been decisive enough in calling for, and giving, enough funds to create a media that can turn the tide. And now we might all fry as a result.It is really quite simple, as I explained in my article It’s Time to Break the Jew Taboo: IT’S THE MEDIA STUPID! The bulk of the media is in the hands of people who have been flat-out lying to the American and European public about Russia, the Middle East, spy poisonings, and much else, and this is, by far the most important factor in why we have arrived where we are.Nothing is as important as the media, NOTHING! It is in every revolutionary’s handbook, right there on page 1, paragraph 1, from Lenin to Mao to Che - when seizing power, the first thing you grab are the printing presses, the radio tower, the TV tower. If you control what people know and believe to be true, you control the people.I will say it again – until we build a media not controlled by the lying psychopaths pushing us towards war, nothing will get better, and we will keep stumbling on to our ultimate doom. I am always amazed how slow people are to wake up to this fundamental truth.And it is not because the folks on our side don’t have the money. Media companies these days are fantastically cheap to build, 100 times cheaper than 30 years ago. A few million dollars and 20 talented men are enough to change history.No, it’s because we failed - we alt-media creators were not smart enough and not energetic enough in requesting the funds, and those in a position to give were not prescient enough to see that getting funds to us was the key to avoiding a global catastrophe.So much for the past. What we can do going forward?The first question is 1) when might this war break out?, how much time do we have?, and 2) is it too late to avert it? My answer to that is: 1) I would say anywhere from tomorrow to 2 years, and 2) OF COURSE WE CAN! - if we act now, and act decisively!From my birds-eye view of the whole alternative media world, which I’ve been scanning and studying every day for three years, I can assure you, the reason alt-media is not breaking through enough is not lack of talented writers or great websites, nor a lack of fair-minded, good-hearted readers looking for answers, it is LACK OF CAPITAL, of resources.Everywhere I look I see the most brilliant, dedicated people creating fantastic content, surpassing by far, in quality, the deceitful sludge churned out by the corporate media, who barely scrape by, who are hampered on every side by, basically … poverty, but who carry on because they know they are doing the right thing. It is at once inspiring, deeply admirable, … and pathetic.What they lack most of all, in addition to things like a livable wage, good equipment and office spaces, health care, etc, are the financial resources needed to push their stories into the field of vision of more readers - basically social media marketing, precisely the sort of thing being so actively discussed now around the Cambridge Analytica / Facebook scandal.If you are reading this and happen to be massively rich, or are the leader of a large northern nuclear power, and want to avert Armageddon, the smartest thing you can do right now is to start handing out not terribly large chunks of cash to about 100 top alternative political sites, blogs, and freelancers on the right and the left.We disagree on a lot of things, but we ALL see the insanity of this march to war with Russia. Given some resources, our collective voices, superior intellect and talent and, most importantly, the fact that the truth is inarguably on our side, will be enough to face down the liars who own and run the mainstream media.One thing I can tell you for sure is that a whole new generation of scrappy media companies who know how to be lean and effective have emerged over the past 10 years. Most of us, like myself, had no idea what we were doing when we started (for RI, that was 3.5 years ago), but for those of us who survived, you cannot imagine a tougher group of battle-hardened new media pros, trolls, memers, and social media jedi masters, who can crush anything in our path if we are just given the funds to do so.  DONATE NOW  Why $300,000, and what's the strategy?(This next part, the bulk of the article, is technical stuff about how we will run the fund drive and an analysis of why alt-media has trouble raising money.I find this sort of thing intensely interesting, but I am weird that way. Most readers may want to skip to the emotional harangue at the end, and then circle back here if they find it convincing.)Roughly, it's $100K for fundraising, $100K to pay writers, and $100K for business expenses for a year. Other alt-media entrepreneurs, note well what I write here, it is free advice which I have learned from my personal experience over the past 3 years.As I said, the main problem for most alt-media sites is lack of capital, which really stems from their inability to raise it. Most of us make the mistake of not realizing that it takes money to raise money.Before starting in RI, I was in the investment business, on the fundraising side. Any fund manager will tell you that the rule of thumb for raising money is that it takes a full 1/3rd of the top guy’s time, and he needs a full-time guy below him. It is time-consuming, and you have to travel.You have to go to meetings, and follow-up meetings. You have to build trust over time. You have to network. You have to write good letters and materials. You have to attend events and conferences. You have to dial and dial and dial that phone. You have to secure meetings. It’s a shoe-leather thing. And the person doing it has to be compelling. If you are the top guy, you have to commit to spending the time, plus, in the finance world, you have to sink a few hundred grand into your full-time guy plus your travel expenses.That’s how you do it, with very few exceptions. Obviously it can get a lot more expensive, but that is the bare-bones minimum. In our case, it is more working with email lists and subscribers, but the time required is about the same.So the first $100K is to field someone serious to raise money, and cover his expenses for 6-12 months. Only a serious fundraising operation keeps the money coming in.  Heck, ask any professional American politician – they spend 70-80% of their time raising money, and have dedicated staff on it!I have recently moved back to the US from Russia, and will be able to spend the necessary time engaging and meeting with donors. This will take a sizable chunk of my time, but it is the only way. Living in Russia, it just wasn’t realistic to field a consistent fundraising effort from there, which is one of the reasons I moved back.Before I go on, I want to say a word about quality over quantity when it comes to people. Many startup companies and especially alt-media operations make the mistake of spreading their scarce resources too thinly over too many people. I made that mistake with RI, and I see it everywhere. This might work on a short-term basis, but you really pay the price over the long term with high turnover, team dissatisfaction, and the quality. No, you are better off paying good salaries to solid people who will not struggle to make ends meet, who will stick with you through life’s ups and downs, rather than trying to cut corners.The next $100K is for writers / editors. Because the fundraising will be taking more time, and because I will be doing more media appearances as part of that, I need a couple of writers / editors to keep the flow of articles on RI at their present level. Here is an example: an appearance recently on Red Ice TV, which was widely watched (30K views to date). I have offers to do many more like this, and will be doing them.The final $100K is for overhead of the above, and a business manager to keep it all functioning.Obviously, to really kick this thing out, we need $3 million, not $300K, and it is perfectly realistic to get that if we can put into place the basic team described above. The $300K is the bare minimum to get started. If we can’t raise that, then we should pack our bags and try something else. Considering that we are all dancing on the edge of incineration, I should probably have a higher minimum, but I will stick with the $300K, for now.Folks, real deeds get done with real resources. Mao was right, power does grow out of the barrel of a gun. Recall Stalin’s famous quip: ‘Remind me again how many divisions the Pope commands’.Why most alt-media fail at fundraisingMost alt-media don’t take this kind of professional approach to fundraising. Foundations do. Charities do. Alt-media hasn’t learned how yet. They are still a relatively new phenomenon. The amounts most of them raise cannot justify a professional fundraising staff. The way it works in most cases is that the editorial staff appeals to the readership to pitch in a few times a year, and among a very few handful of sites that have a devoted enough following, this brings in just enough to kind of, sort of, make ends meet, but not really.This is not a formula for success, believe me. That is how Russia Insider has survived over the past 3 years. We have raised about $300,000 this way. It is not enough.Our fund drive deadlineThe typical amount we raise in our quarterly fund drives is $20 – 30,000, which might lead one to conclude that $300,000 is too ambitious. For this reason, I am setting no deadline for this at all, rather leaving it open-ended.Instead, I am doing the following: First of all, I am asking folks to make their usual quarterly contribution to keep us going for the next few months – please be generous – this time it really counts.We are set up for anonymous giving, for those for whom this is an issue. You can find instructions on our donation page. It is easy, and it works!  DONATE NOW  Second, I want you to think about how much you would be willing to contribute, if enough people came together to hit the $300K. Please let me know that amount in the form below, along with a contact email. It’s not a hard pledge, just a possible number. If we hit our target in tentative pledges, I will let you all know, and we can decide what to do from there.Starting today, I will post the amounts raised and pledged on a banner on the site, so that we can all see how much resolve there is out there to make this happen. I will post both the current quarter totals, plus the soft pledges towards the $300K, plus the number of people joining.This public reporting will provide a good backdrop for an ongoing discussion with supporters about how we are doing, and what we need to do to hit our target. I have a lot more to say on this subject, so please stay tuned for follow-up posts on this, and I am very interested in your feedback. If you don't want to use the comments section below, you can write me at the email address above.The drive for the larger sum of $300,000 is open-ended. I suspect that we will reach some number short of that in the soft pledges. The value of that number is not terribly important. What I will then do is barnstorm, browbeat, buttonhole, and shake by the lapels as much of the public as I can reach, and try to get through to people, that unless we man up and take responsibility for our survival, then we do not deserve to survive.We must fightRarely in life is anything worth having ever handed to one on a silver platter, and when it is, it is usually unappreciated and quickly squandered. Things worth having have to be fought for by people who roll up their sleeves and get the job done themselves.Nobody is going to do this for us. Do not think that we can just wait until things get bad enough, and some sensible billionaire will step in and fix it for us. We, the ones with the sense to realize what is going on, are the one who are going to have to do this, and we are going to have to do it now.If we want to avoid a war, stop the madness, and really turn this fight around, we are going to have to struggle, sacrifice, and raise and invest substantial amounts. There is no other way. The $300,000 is just the beginning. The next milestone is $3 million.One thing you can be certain of, I will bring this challenge to 100s of 1000s of people: which will it be, War? or Peace?, Death? or Victory? There is no middle option. Are we going to allow this continued slide towards mayhem and agony, or fight back with the means necessary?The time has come for the American people to decide.What you can do to helpObviously donate and pledge. Don’t feel that a small amount is not worth bothering with, because the number of people lending their voice is a big example to others. Bravery is contagious.There are some of you reading this who really do have the access to people with the money to make this happen quickly, and have a sense of how to get there. If you can help, please be in touch with me. I live in the New York City area. You can reach me at the email above.Here’s how much most people give: - the most common amounts are between $20 - $40. Plenty of folks give $75 and $100 if they can afford it. Over $200 the number of donors really thins out, but some folks give from $500 to $5000, sometimes more. But a lot of folks give $1 or $5, and I love those donations, because I know some of these people are in hardship, for whom that hurts a little, and that is more admirable than a comfortable person giving much more. Remember the widow’s mite.Another very important way to help is to evangelize. If you think what we do here, and more importantly, what we could do, is vitally important, then there is a very good chance that you have friends or contacts that share your political and social values who are not aware of us, or have not considered giving. You can talk to them and urge them to do so. In this way you can greatly multiply your giving. In these fraught times, this is terribly important.Another way to make a difference is to go on public forums and write about and share this article, and my other articles, which you can find here, and other articles on the site. There are so many amazing ones. This can also have a huge impact.We've demonstrated that we can do thisFolks, we are getting about 10 million (actually more), views per month across all of our platforms. 60% of that is in the US and Canada, and 30% is in Western Europe, mostly UK, Germany, and France. We are widely reposted on a host of other websites, so our actual audience size is easily double that. On the website alone, there are close to 1 million comments, and as many on our other platforms. Many of them are exhaustively long, most of them confirming what we publish on the site. This too is extraordinary, a ringing endorsement of our approach and positions.That is a near miracle considering the resources we have had to build this, and it shows how much can be done with relatively modest funds by smart, determined people armed with the truth.What I will advocate for with your funds:Stopping the insane and dangerous hating on Russia and the march to war with her being pushed by our media, and calling out the liars in government and media.Stopping the encroaching censorship being orchestrated by the Deep State – there can be no more vital issue which we Americans have to stand up for at this time. We need to organize on this – if angry feminists and the anti-gun lobby can field half a million people in demonstrations – we can field millions – and we should! We need to rein-in the out-of-control tech platforms and their war agenda! We need to regulate them!Stopping the out-of-control military spending which is bankrupting our country and laying waste to the whole world. It is a moral and fiscal outrage. It is time to act!Some information about meMy friends, I am a proud patriot of my country. My namesake great-grandfathers, stout Christians, arrived in Philadelphia from the German Rhineland in 1712, and helped build the great town of Lancaster, PA. Another great-grandfather (George Ross) signed the Declaration of Independence and was a member of the Continental Congress, which governed the colonies during the War for Independence, and an officer in the Pennsylvania Militia. He was Betsy Ross’s uncle.Another grandfather (or grandmother) arrived in the hold of a slave ship God knows when. His (or her) descendant, my great-grandfather, became a prominent mulatto political leader in the post Civil War era (Richard Greener).My family has fought, and sometimes died (2 dead in WW2), in every American war going back to the founding of our country.From Russia, I have watched with growing alarm and horror, as a small group of what can only be called liars, who dominate our media, and their allies in the government, have pushed and heaved mightily to bring our country to the brink of a world war, and have advocated for the most vile crimes around the world, murdering millions in the Middle East, and tens of thousands in many other places. I have devoted the last three years of my life to speaking out about this, at great personal sacrifice to myself and my family.I returned to Connecticut because I realized that there is only so much one can achieve with harangues from across the ocean, and I urge you to join me in this fight, for a fight it most certainly is, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.Our same government and media, hijacked by un-American psychopaths, who are driving our country to war, are also destroying our country from within. I think Trump has been heroic in standing up to them, but events of the last month demonstrate conclusively that he is slowly being overwhelmed.I have lived and worked in Russia on and off for 20-some years, and lived there as a child, for my father was a foreign correspondent there, the bureau chief for the Associated Press, in the early 70s. I speak Russian fluently and know and understand the people and the country as well as I do my own, and have traveled its width and breadth many times over. My work in agriculture took me to many remote rural places, the very heartland. Many were the times I was told by this good, sturdy, warm-hearted people that I was the first foreigner they had ever met. I am married to a Russian woman and have four daughters. I am a convinced and committed Christian, and talk and write about my faith, and operate a website about Christianity in Russia called 'Russian Faith'.I return to my home country outraged at what my government is doing at home and abroad, and determined to do what I can to fight what can only be described as treason.Two things I detest most are dishonesty and betrayal, and fear is not an emotion I feel much, other than a fear of God.It is time to actI can assure you that the Russian people are as good and kind and generous a Christian people of high character as you will find anywhere, and that their leaders reflect that character. In addition they are marvelously talented and able, and are due the most sincere admiration in every respect.They have suffered grievously for long stretches of the past 100 years under an odious tyranny not reflective of their own national character. Mr. Putin is a good man, a sincere Christian, and a brilliant leader who has been viciously slandered by those same liars in the media who are destroying our own country, and slandering our own President.Most of what most Americans know about Russia, both past and present, is a grotesque lie, peddled by our media. Russiagate is a preposterous, transparent lie, exactly as our President says, and it amazes me that so many of my fellow citizens could be taken in by this childish ruse. Russia is no threat to us, on the contrary, she wants to have friendly relations, and has been routinely rebuffed over the last 18 years by the same monsters who are running our country into the ground.Our President is right to say that we should have good relations with Russia. This drives the media and their creatures in the swamp mad with rage, for there is nothing they detest more than the validation and success of this Christian nation. The swamp’s lying, military aggression, and false flags, become ever more wild and shameless in response.If you are not familiar with the site, take the time to peruse it and you will see for yourself that all this is incontrovertibly true. All the information you need is there. Read the comments and you will see there are millions of Americans and Europeans who emphatically agree with what is written there. I will be speaking publicly about all this in the coming months, and I urge you all to listen in.I give you my word as a Christian, if you send us the resources, we will beat back and destroy this very real and present threat to our very existence.Consider that we are the many, the 99%, and they, the few. We are smarter and tougher than they are, and crucially, we have the truth on our side. All we have to do is join together in one mighty voice and shine a brilliant light on them, and they will first back down, and then flee, for at heart they are cowards, as all liars inherently are.Check the homepage to see how we are doing. I will be updating the results of this appeal daily, and writing frequently about what we can all be doing to save the world from a terrible, impending, war.Spread the word. It’s time to act. The hour is late.As Martin Luther King liked to say, \"Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for THEE!\"  DONATE NOW  For the explanation above of the 'soft pledge' target of $300,000, please click here.This post first appeared on Russia InsiderAnyone is free to republish, copy, and redistribute the text in this content (but not the images or videos) in any medium or format, with the right to remix, transform, and build upon it, even commercially, as long as they provide a backlink and credit to Russia Insider.

Then, a nuclear war between the two was highly probable, and the existence of humanity was in question. This time, there was a moderate possibility of a local clash between the American and Russian forces in the area, which might have escalated to a higher level, only then putting global security in danger.False Flag is a concept that goes back centuries. It was considered to be a legitimate ploy by the Greeks and Romans, where a military force would pretend to be friendly to get close to an enemy before dropping the pretense and raising its banners to reveal its own affiliation just before launching an attack.A group of neocon heartthrobs have banded together with an eclectic array of Russiagaters to form a visionary organization committed to protecting Western democracy.

While media pointed finger at Russia, it denied involvement, saying it has better things to do than harass US aircraft.The claim was made Tuesday by the head of the US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) Army General Tony Thomas. The \"daily\" interference in Syria disrupts US military communications and hampers aircraft missions, the general told the US Geospatial Intelligence Foundation's 2018 GEOINT Symposium.Witnesses of the alleged chemical attack in Douma, including 11-year-old Hassan Diab and hospital staff, told reporters at The Hague that the White Helmets video used as a pretext for a US-led strike on Syria was, in fact, staged.“We were at the basement and we heard people shouting that we needed to go to a hospital. We went through a tunnel. At the hospital they started pouring cold water on me,” the boy told the press conference, gathered by Russia’s mission at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague.On April 14th Trump bombed Syria. A few days before the Russian naval flotilla in Syria’s Tartous sailed out for “drills” in the eastern Med. We now know that as part of these live fire drills the Russians arranged for quite the demonstration for the Americans.An old decommissioned Syrian frigate (of Soviet make) was dragged out to sea and used as target for Russian anti-ship missiles.A commentary entitled Tehran, Moscow boosting strategic relations, appearing last week in the Iran Daily newspaper, which is close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei – and subsequently circulated by IRNA – noted as follows:“Policies adopted by Tehran and Moscow are becoming more harmonious on a daily basis as their bilateral as well as multilateral moves and measures are becoming more consistent with each other.”A Twitter user, @obretix, has noted few more signs of Trump’s widely-announced troops withdrawal from Syria.Show your support by disabling ad-block (How)Buy AD-FREE ACCESS here, for only $19 / yrThanks for your supportWe’re winning thanks to YOU!Disabling adblock for a specific site just takes a couple of clicks.Usually it is as simple as clicking on the adblock icon in your browser, and choosing the ‘disable on this page or domain’ option.If that doesn’t work this wikihow article gives more detail:  https://www.wikihow.com/Disable-AdBlockThank you for your support!(more info) Join us! | About | Contact | Investors | Crowdfunding | RSS\n\n","header":"Featured","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-23T23:30:05.656Z"},"time":null}

The story first broke by the Wall Street Journal by the firm’s parent SCL Group, which is also closing down.The Chair of the UK’s House of Commons select committee for Digital affairs, Damian Collins, told the BBC that the company “cannot be allowed” to delete their data history by closing.Facebook’s troubles will continue, as probes into how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in the UK and the US will continue.The story first broke by the New York Times and the Observer in March also established the common infrastructure between the two conservative campaigns.Later revelations have also raised an allegation of illegal campaign funding for the Leave and Vote Leave campaigns, laundered through a Canadian company, AggregateIQ (AIQ), using the Cambridge Analytica infrastructure.The revelations rocked Facebook’s stock valuation and the company continues to be exposed to litigation costs. ISBA – a British group of advertisers representing 3,000 brands – is threatening to pull out of Facebook.The London-based Privacy International advocacy group is proposing a cluster of legal measures to avoid the next Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. One of the key features of the Privacy International proposals is the shift of focus from companies exploiting data – like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica – to data ownership. That is significant because consumers do not have the technological expertise to understand how deeply technological behemoths can penetrate into their privacy.According to a July 2016 Eurobarometer study, more than seven in ten Europeans (72%) say it is very important that the confidentiality of their e-mails and online instant messaging is guaranteed.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7ee13a6dba1b08b5ab57dc"},"url":"https://www.neweurope.eu/article/privacy-international-avoid-next-facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal/","content":"The London-based Privacy International advocacy group is proposing a cluster of legal measures to avoid the next Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal.While the attention on the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica focuses on two of the most controversial political campaigns of the 21st century – the Leave campaign in the UK and the Trump campaign in the US—the bigger picture is that big data is here to stay in politics.Big data is not only threatening to change politics but end citizenship. The very definition of totalitarianism implies the end of separation between the private and the public, which big data could affect.Privacy International is a group that calls for citizens’ control over who generates and exploits data. In the aftermath of Cambridge Analytica, the London-based human rights advocacy group is calling for a cluster of measures that would shield the essence of privacy in a digital society.The end of privacyOne of the key features of the Privacy International proposals is the shift of focus from companies exploiting data – like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica – to data ownership.On Thursday morning, The Times of London run a story on how ISBA – a British group of advertisers representing 3,000 brands – is threatening to pull out of Facebook, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, in a world of digital oligopoly, it is not clear that this is a credible threat. What’s more, the principle of “free services” in exchange for use of citizens’ data has not been challenged.On Wednesday evening, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologised for mistakes over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, but the focus was on political manipulation, not the principle that a company can hold a vast monopoly of personal data, in which governments can also share.Privacy International suggests that there is an urgent need to focus on data ownership, or risk nightmare scenarios, like banks rating a client’s creditworthiness on the basis of their social connections.Reclaiming privacyThe first proposal by advocacy groups is to turn privacy into a fundamental right.That is significant because consumers do not have the technological expertise to understand how deeply technological behemoths can penetrate into their privacy.According to a July 2016 Eurobarometer study, more than seven in ten Europeans (72%) say it is very important that the confidentiality of their e-mails and online instant messaging is guaranteed. However, only 37% of Europeans know that their voice and instant messaging communication can legally be accessed by private interests without their consent.To make this right effective, individual data should no longer be regarded a commodity. If personal data can be sold, in a world of only a handful of online behemoths, international corporations will be able to “shake” users for their data as a precondition to gaining access to online services.A role for governmentsAlthough government regulation is often portrayed as the end of freedom, the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal suggest that untamed corporations poses as big a challenge.Privacy International suggests a bigger role for governments, so that privacy violations and political manipulation are effectively protected, rather than accidentally revealed by whistleblowers two years down the line. According to Privacy international “the current scandal shows that many unlawful practices take place without being seen and are only revealed when independent researchers conduct lengthy and detailed investigations. On the one hand, governments can go after those buying citizens’ private data sets, including political parties, thereby limiting big data manipulation of political campaigning. At the very minimum, Privacy International suggests, citizens must know which data analytics companies a political party contracts, how much they pay for its services, and precisely what these services are. In sum, citizens should have the right to know why and how they are politically targeted.On the other hand, governments must spend money in monitoring a wide range of personal data-mining. Privacy International supports the adoption of draft EU ePrivacy Regulation that will prevent companies tracking individuals online, going beyond statistics to the profiling of individual citizens.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"Privacy International: how to avoid the next Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:30:47.977Z"},"time":"Mar 22, 2018"}

Britain's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has applied for a warrant to search the offices of 'Cambridge Analytica', which is accused of using the personal data of 50 million Facebook members for its own campaigns during the US presidential elections in 2016 and Brexit referendum.  EPA-EFE/ANDY RAINMark Zuckerberg will not testify to a UK parliamentary committee regarding users’ data being exploited by the Cambridge Analytica consultancy, Facebook announced on Tuesday.Addressing the same committee on Tuesday, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie expressed the certainty that without the consultancy’s intervention the EU membership referendum would have a very different outcome.Wylie said the Leave campaign “cheated.”Leaks undermining the legitimacy of the Leave campaign began last week when another whistleblower, Shamir Sanni, provided evidence of illicit funding to the tune of €711,000.Specifically, the Leave campaign used a proxy campaign – BeLeave – to pay the Canadian data-analytics company AggregateIQ (AIQ) for online campaigning services.Sanni’s documents seem to establish that BeLeave was run from the former offices of the Leave campaign; moreover, the two campaigns coordinated spending.On the top of the €711,000 that BeLeave paid AIQ, the Leave campaign paid €3 million, or 40% of its total budget. The allegation here is that BeLeave was in effect a vehicle for laundering campaign funds for the leave campaign.According to Wylie, the €4 million paid to AIQ was money well spent, as targeted online campaigning tilted the balance between winning and losing.AIQ was in turn created by Wylie himself on behalf of SLC, that is, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, linked to the Trump campaign. Both AIQ and Cambridge Analytica drew their data from the same source, which included the Facebook pool of 50 million users.“This is a company that has worked with hacked material, this is a company that will send out videos of people being murdered to intimidate voters, this is a company that goes out and tries to illicitly acquire live internet browsing data of everyone in an entire country,” Wylie told the parliamentary committee on Tuesday.As for Facebook, the company continues to deny knowing that Cambridge Analytica had harvested Facebook data for the Trump campaign. Facebook will address the questions of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee. Instead of Mark Zuckerberg, the questions of the committee will be addressed either by Facebook’s Chief Technology Officer, Mike Schroepfer, or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox.

In the United States, Cambridge Analytica mined 50 million individual accounts, the New York Times and the Observer reported on Saturday.The far-right pioneering big data in political campaigningThe data-analytics company is the common denominator between the UK’s Leave campaign and Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign.The Cambridge Analytica CEO is Alexander Nix and its owner is the 70-year old US conservative hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. Mercer contributed $11 million to a pro-Cruz Super PAC; when he dropped out, he moved to donate $13,5 million to the Donald Trump campaign. Mercer is a major investor in the far-right media outlet Breitbart News Network, co-owned by the former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.The Guardian reported that Mercer offered the services of Cambridge Analytica to Nigel Farage for Leave campaign free of charge.Mining and politically exploiting personal dataThe name of the company (“Cambridge”) is derived from the psychologist Dr. Aleksandr Kogan of Cambridge University. Kogan developed the “this is your digital life” application that translates various data into behavioural proxies that can be used to target voters.The Facebook of micro-targeting has clearly influenced the way Cambridge Analytica exploits data, linking 5,000 data points to behavioural trends to provide so-called psychographic profiles, which can be exploited by political campaigns.Target groups are no longer broken down into “demographic groups” alone, but also “psychographic” groups, in terms of personality traits such as “openness,” “extraversion,” “neuroticism,” and the like.Whose dataUsers downloaded the app voluntarily, using a Facebook login to subscribe to other services. Therefore, the company gained full access to personal data, including residence, social networks, and “likes.” While this app was downloaded by hundreds of thousands, until 2015, the app could also gain access to “friends’” data.This created a pool of tens of millions.According to Facebook, this data was apparently sold to third parties. A Friday post made the allegations explicit:“In 2015, we learned that … Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe,” Facebook said.According to Facebook, Kegan violated company policy. The software that allows the exploitation of individual personal data – and those of friends – has since been removed and the data has been destroyed. Kogan’s Cambridge Analytica claims:“We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information,” the company said in a statement.Legal and political reaction in the US and the UKHours after the Facebook announcement, the Massachusetts attorney-general announced the opening of an investigation that will involve both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The company is not facing allegations of hacking personal information; however, instead the commissioner will be investigating whether or not the use of existing data is legal.The UK information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, reacted to the banning of Cambridge Analytica from the Facebook platform announcing her own probe in the use of analytics in political campaigning. For over a year, there is an ongoing probe into how Cambridge Anatylica and other analytics companies influenced the referendum on EU membership. Part of the question at hand is whether Russia was involved in the process.Facebook faces its own legal hurdles, as its model of data-mining and micro-targeting has been criticized by the European Commission. Beginning in May, companies that supply user data for political purposes without their explicit consent will face fines of up to 4% of their revenue.US Senators are also considering the regulation of the internet, the Financial Times report, citing the vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on intelligence, Mark Warner. The case made by advocates of internet regulation is that information that is unaccountable is not transparent and deception can become the norm.Cambridge Analytica has surfaced in Rubert Mueller’s investigation in allegations of Russian meddling with the US campaign. Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. The company said that the role was planned but never materialised.\nEmail\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nUsername or E-mail:\n\n","header":"Facebook bans access to its platform to the company behind the Leave and Trump campaigns","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:32:39.910Z"},"time":"Mar 17, 2018"}

However, CA claims it received data from only 30 million Facebook profiles.If you have shared your data with third-party apps and they have stored it outside the platform, you cannot destroy that information, short of launching legal action. But there is one sure-fire way to keep third parties’ hands off your personal data in the future – by deleting your account.To do that, you need to log into the profile you want to remove, before navigating to https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account and clicking “Delete My Account”.According to Facebook, it may take up to 90 days for all your information to be deleted, including your posts, photos and other data. During that time, it will be inaccessible to other people using the site, but private messages you have sent to other users will still remain.But this looks set to change. In a statement to Techcrunch, a Facebook spokesperson confirmed an “Unsend” feature was in the works that would allow users to erase their messages.“We will now be making a broader delete message feature available,” they said on Friday. “This may take some time.\"","header":"Were your details leaked to Cambridge Analytica?

Their responses were then paired with information taken from their social media profile, including their gender, age, relationship status, location and ‘likes’, to establish their personality traits and political views.Within months, around 320,000 Facebook users had downloaded the app, exposing both their profiles and those belonging to their Facebook Friends – around 87 million in total – as the social network allowed apps to retrieve such data at the time.Those individuals were then linked to electoral records obtained by SCL, and targeted with highly personalized political advertising for CA’s partners and clients.CEO Alexander Nix has previously said CA was a major player in Donald Trump’s election in 2016, telling undercover reporters that the company “ran all the digital campaign” for the Republican candidate.The company also received payments totaling almost $6 million from Trump’s campaign team in 2016, according to government records, yet they have since vehemently downplayed CA’s role in their success.In a statement released in October, campaign director Michael Glassner said data analysis was managed solely by the Republican National Committee and “any claims that voter data from any other source played a key role in the victory are false”.CA’s work may have also influenced the result of the UK’s Brexit referendum, when Britons voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Aaron Banks, the co-founder of pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU, said in a book published in October 2015 that the group had hired the firm which uses “big data and advanced psychographics” to influence people. In November that year, Leave.EU also announced its partnership with the company on its website, saying CA “will be helping us map the British electorate and what they believe in, enabling us to better engage with voters”.But again, there have been stringent denials that the organisations worked together, with Banks telling Reuters that the group accepted “no benefit in kind, no data, no nothing” from CA.He later told a parliamentary committee that his reference to the firm being “hired” in a book solely signaled Leave.EU’s intention to work with them.In the aftermath of the Guardian’s exposé in March, Facebook has stated that claims Kogan’s app committed a data breach were “completely false” as “people knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked”.Yet Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), CA and Kogan were banned from the social network, pending an investigation, for violating the platform’s policies. Their infringements included passing information to a third party and allegedly failing to delete Facebook data at the company’s request.The technology giant went on to update their terms and conditions to restrict data access from third-party apps.But this weekend, Canadian political consulting firm AggregateIQ was also suspended amid reports of ties to CA, as well as the data analysis company CubeYou, which is associated with Cambridge University. The latter, which used personality quizzes to grab data, reportedly labeled its product as being \"for non-profit academic research\", even though the information was being shared with marketers.  And Facebook’s maneuvers have not been enough to pacify the authorities, nor settle debates concerning data privacy and regulation.In March, ICO investigators raided CA’s headquarters in London. And earlier this month, the body confirmed it was investigating 30 organisations, including Facebook, as part of a national inquiry into the use of personal data and analytics for political and commercial purposes.Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement: “The ICO is looking at how data was collected from a third-party app on Facebook and shared with Cambridge Analytica. We are also conducting a broader investigation into how social media platforms were used in political campaigning.”The US Federal Trade Commission is also investigating whether Facebook improperly allowed Cambridge Analytica access to users’ personal data, breaching a consent agreement the social network signed with the agency in 2011. The decree stipulated that Facebook must notify users and acquire their explicit permission before sharing their data beyond what their privacy settings allowed.The technology giant’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg will answer lawmakers' questions in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday (April 10-11).","header":"The Facebook data leak: What happened and what’s next","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:34:50.035Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  09/04/2018\n"}

It came amid questions over how Russia used the social network during the US election of 2016, and how political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest data from 87 million Facebook profiles without most users’ consent.But his job will get harder should the US follow the EU’s lead and install aggressive data protection legislation to empower citizens.In an effort to harmonise such laws across the continent, the EU has prepared the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will come into force from 25 May 2018.The framework would ensure internet users’ personal data is not shared without their express consent, and that organisations have thorough data protection policies and records of their activities in place, as well as a data protection officer in some cases.They would need to guarantee that personal data is processed lawfully, transparently, and for a specific purpose until it no longer serves that aim, by which time it must be deleted.The rules would apply to all companies that control or process data from within the bloc, regardless of where they are physically based, and it would be their responsibility to adhere to them.The regulation represents the biggest overhaul in data protection law in Europe since 1995, and will make companies like Facebook more accountable than ever should personal data be improperly handled. Fines imposed under the new rules could amount to as much as 4% of a company’s global annual revenue.There is little hope the 87 million Facebook users affected by the data harvest will be able to claw back their personal information from Cambridge Analytica (CA) and get justice short of launching legal action. However, a regulation as rigid as the GDPR should prevent similar data leaks from occurring on its patch.The reason the leak was so large was because CA was able to retrieve personal data belonging to the friends of Facebook users that downloaded their quiz app — their data-harvesting tool — because it was allowed by the social network at the time: Facebook Friends’ consent was not required.But under the GDPR, companies must have users’ permission, given via a clear affirmative action, before they can receive their personal data or override their privacy preferences.Secondly, personal data sought by a business must be specified contractually and must be necessary for the service it provides. Aside from pooling information from users’ friends, Facebook has since confirmed that CA may have collected private messages, too. Such data was not needed for users to complete personality tests on the quiz app, and taking it would have breached GDPR rules.The regulation also requires that companies inform the relevant data protection authority should a breach occur that risks peoples’ rights and freedoms within 72 hours of being made aware of it. Facebook has admitted that it first learnt data was being handled improperly by Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the quiz app, and CA in 2015 — two years before it was exposed publicly and brought to authorities’ attention. Under the GDPR, such an infraction would incur a penalty equal to 2% of the social network’s annual worldwide revenue ($813 million in 2017). An eye-watering amount that would likely displease shareholders and threaten 33-year-old Zuckerberg's position in the company.","header":"Could new EU data protection law have stopped the Cambridge Analytica scandal?","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:35:09.847Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  11/04/2018\n"}

The company's chief executive, Alexander Nix, was also recorded by ITN Channel 4 News — NBC's UK partner — detailing how the company could use bribes, blackmail and misinformation campaigns to influence the outcomes of foreign elections.But it's not clear that the $15.4 million Trump and other U.S. political entities dished out to Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 election cycle was money well spent.\"What they're doing is bullshit, basically,\" said Antonio García Martínez, a former Facebook employee who helped build the social network's ad-targeting operation. \"This has been tried before. There's no reason to think it's particularly powerful.\"In theory, Cambridge Analytica could predict and influence voters' behaviors by delving into personal details shared by Facebook users through an \"OCEAN\" personality survey, which measures openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. The idea of \"psychographic\" targeting is to use those personal details to create advertising that is more likely to influence which candidate voters choose or whether they come out to vote.Martí­nez said that the targeting done by Cambridge Analytica might have been considered good by political advertising standards.\"The reality was that political ad targeting in the past wasn't very good,\" Martí­nez said. \"I think what's happened is they just caught up.\"In a presidential election decided by roughly 80,000 votes in three states, many factors could be considered potentially determinative. But Republican and Democratic operatives familiar with data science and the type of information reaped by Cambridge Analytica say there's scant evidence that the firm was effective — or that it provided information more valuable than the basic voter-file data the Trump campaign could have gotten elsewhere.That is, they don't believe the election turned on Cambridge Analytica's involvement.\"Any data is only useful in so far as it can help me build a more predictive model,\" said a leading GOP data scientist who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. \"Whether or not someone likes Taylor Swift or did a keg stand in college is far less useful to me than whether or not they voted in the Republican or Democratic primary in previous years. And until someone proves to me that OCEAN score targeting truly can be used to behaviorally persuade a voter, I'll remain skeptical of the value.\"Eric Wilson, a GOP digital political operative, said that even if the personal details gleaned from Facebook were more potent than other data, a campaign would still have to figure out how to tailor ads to voters.\"The psychographic data is only as good as the creative you're able to generate,\" he said.And a Democratic operative who works in the digital realm said claims of Cambridge Analytica's effectiveness in 2016 are very much overstated.But Christopher Wylie, who helped found the company and served as its director of research until 2014, argues that its work is subtle enough that it might not be noticed.\"A lot of what information operations is, is about warping people's perceptions,\" Wylie told NBC News. \"This is a company that was birthed out of a military contractor. The premise is not necessarily to do standard political messaging where people are aware that I am trying to be convinced of something. It is to change what people think and perceive about what is real.\"Trump's campaign spent $5.9 million on Cambridge Analytica services; Ted Cruz's presidential campaign shelled out $5.8 million to the company; and Make America Number 1, a superPAC funded by billionaire Robert Mercer, who backed Cruz in the GOP primary before switching to Trump in the general election, paid the firm about $1.5 million.Mercer invested heavily in the company. And one of his daughters, Rebekah, sits on the board, which announced Tuesday that it had suspended Nix.Wylie said that Steve Bannon, a then-Mercer ally who later became the chief executive of Trump's campaign, was particularly interested in what the company was offering.\"Steve wanted weapons for his culture war,\" Wylie told ITN Channel 4. \"We offered him a way to accomplish what he wanted to do, which was change the culture of America.\"Cambridge Analytica has rejected Wylie's assertions, and a spokesman for the firm said he is engaged in \"a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\"The Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica actually had an underwhelming digital operation, said Jessica Baldwin-Phillipi, an associate professor at Fordham University who has studied the digital efforts of political campaigns.\"The idea that they had a robust data campaign is just not true,\" she said. \"They were doing very best practice stuff on the Facebook side, but they weren't doing this universally. It wasn't deep or robust.\"She agreed with the political operatives that there is little evidence to support claims that Cambridge Analytica helped swing the election.\"Time and again, studies have shown us that the most persuasive targeting metrics are not crazy-specific microtargeting data but public-record voting history data and geography,\" she said.","header":"Cambridge Analytica and the shortcomings of 'psychographic' data","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:35:30.867Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  21/03/2018\n"}

Cambridge Analytica allegedly harvested tens of millions of Facebook users’ personal information without their permission. That data was then reportedly used to influence and wage a so-called culture war during the 2016 US presidential election.Was this data used to help elect Donald Trump?\n          “I think it’s really important for Americans to know what this company has been doing with their data and it’s really important I think to find out: was this data used to help elect Donald Trump?” Wylie asked in an interview on NBC’s The Today Show.“I think we need to step back for a second and de-politicise this because this is about the safety of Americans and the integrity of the American democratic process”, he added.Wylie says the goal was to exploit what was known about the Facebook users and “target their inner demons.”“What Cambridge Analytica does is works on creating a web of disinformation online so that people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites, etc., that make them think that certain things are happening that may not be.”Both he and Carole Cadwalladr – the Observer journalist who helped break the story - are calling for those responsible to be held accountable.“This data was misappropriated and mishandled by this company and I think that they need to investigated for that”, Wylie demanded.Cadwalladr has labelled it “one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches.” Facebook has unequivocally denied a data breach.“I think what there is to see here is a multi-billion-dollar Silicon Valley company, which allowed this vast, vast trove of personal information to be harvested and to be used in ways that people can’t see and don’t understand. And that, to me, is the heart of this story at the moment. And, where is Mark Zuckerberg? That’s what everybody wants to know. Because Facebook’s executives were questioned in the US by congressional investigators and in the UK by MPs and they were asked direct questions about this. They were asked direct questions: does Cambridge Analytica have Facebook data? And they said no. And that is a huge scandal and I think they really need to step up and start answering questions properly now”, she told MSNBC’s Morning Joe.Cadwalladr said she came across an American connection when she was investigating a potential link between Cambridge Analytica and the Brexit referendum in the UK.“This is absolutely Transatlantic because this is how I came to it initially: I was investigating Cambridge Analytica’s role in Brexit and that was the first stage of it. [I?] wrote about that in February last year and that kicked off two investigations, which are still ongoing, about what the firm did during the European referendum. But it was then that I discovered this amazing young man Christopher Wylie, who’s the one who’s gone on record over the weekend – it’s taken us a year to get him over the line – and, he has the paper trail, he has the documents and the receipts and the contracts… So, this thing that Facebook have just denied for two years, he was able to come forward and say ‘I can prove this’. So the point is we actually just don’t know how this data was used during Trump’s campaign, because everyone’s just denied it up till now. Cambridge Analytica’s just denied it had that data, Facebook denied it had that data. So we’re only at the very, very starting point, I think, of being able to ask questions about this. But, my colleagues at The New York Times, they saw the data last week and this was the kind of amazing breakthrough. Because of the legal sensitivities, I couldn’t see it, but through some means I cannot tell you about, they actually saw the data and it was only then that Facebook started taking this seriously and only then that they started responding”, she said.  And what about people working on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign?“Well, there’s a kind of fascinating detail which hasn’t come out, yet, really. Robert Mercer, he was the investor into Cambridge Analytica and Steve Bannon (former White House Chief Strategist), he was the vice president of Cambridge Analytica. And it was Robert Mercer who, when Steve Bannon started working for the Trump campaign that was when Cambridge Analytica got brought onto the Trump campaign. And that’s a really key moment. And that happened in August. And it was only in August, a few days before, that Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Christopher Wylie and said ‘Oh, by the way, have you still got the data? Can you tick a box and tell us that you’ve deleted it?’ So, there’s some really key timings going on here about it was only when Cambridge Analytica were brought on to work with Trump and Steve Bannon was brought on to work with Trump that Facebook suddenly thought ‘Oh, there may be some issue here now’ and actually took efforts to sort of try and secure the data. But the efforts they went to were so pathetic. Christopher says that they literally sent him a form and said ‘Tick a box and tell us that you’ve deleted it’ and they did nothing else to ensure that it had been”, Cadwalladr told Morning Joe viewers.Video editor • Sarah Taylor","header":"Did Cambridge Analytica help elect Donald Trump?","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:35:51.194Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  19/03/2018\n"}

Separately, the data firm is also being investigated over its role in the UK's Brexit referendum. Further revelations suggesting Cambridge Analytica engaged in apparently unethical tactics to sway political campaigns are continuing to emerge, as authorities in Europe and the US begin to take steps to investigate the allegations.The data was harvested in 2014 from a Facebook quiz which asked users to learn their personality type. Developed by an academic at the University of Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan, the Thisisyourdigitallife app gained access not only to personal data of people taking the quiz, but that of their friends too. This practice was permitted by Facebook at the time, but has since been banned.  AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsFacebook needs to fundamentally reconsider its business model and also the checks and balances it has in place to deal with the political complexity of what goes on within their platform.\n          Through these friend networks, the data of 50 million users - mostly in the US - was gathered without their knowledge, even though only 270,000 people took the quiz and had consented to their data being used for academic purposes, according to Christopher Wylie, who worked as a data analyst for Cambridge Analytica. The firm bought the data, he says, and used it to psychologically profile individuals and send them targeted content in support of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election campaign.  Cambridge Analytica denies it used the data during its work on the Trump campaign.Facebook's terms at the time did not authorise app developers to share user data with third parties, like Cambridge Analytica. When they discovered the breach two years ago, Facebook says, they removed the app and told the developer to delete the data and certify that it had done so.Whether Cambridge Analytica destroyed the data is disputed. The firm says it deleted the data when asked to do so by Facebook (and claims the information was never used for political purposes), while Wylie claims copies of the data still exist. And The New York Times says it recently saw some of the raw data that Kogan shared with Cambridge Analytica.The Leave.EU campaign has also claimed it worked with Cambridge Analytica in the lead up to the Brexit referendum, although the firm has denied this.  Euronews spoke to Varoon Bashyakarla and Stephanie Hankey from Tactical Tech, a Berlin-based technology activist organization working on digital security, privacy and the ethics of data, about the scandal.  What makes this apparent attempt to influence voters different from targeted political marketing tactics of the past?Facebook normally provides a matching service, enabling advertisers to find people to advertise to on the platform, just like Google and other platforms who don’t actually give away data, but sell access to it. What this means in the case of Facebook, is that they have services that allow political campaigns to upload voter lists to Facebook, and Facebook will then search the lists and display ads to those users who are also on Facebook.Instead of the usual matching service, in this case Facebook gave away user data. Even if it was presumed to be for academic research, the volume of data handed over was unprecedented (50 million users). This, in turn, enabled the data to be shared with Cambridge Analytica.This handing over of data matters for both privacy and legal reasons, but people are particularly concerned because of how invasive and personal the resulting profiling efforts were – attempts to predict individuals’ personal details (their levels of openness, contentiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) to ultimately influence their votes.Is this likely to be a one-off abuse of Facebook user data or something that happens often?This is something that happens often with personal data, but one of the few instances where there has been detailed documentation. Usually this information is hard to come by due to the closed way Facebook and other similar companies do business. One of the important aspects of this breach of trust was the manner in which users of the Thisisyourdigitallife app unwittingly exposed their friends’ data in the process. At the same time, these users opted in, and few people actually read the terms and conditions of tech services before clicking the “I agree” box. As none of us really do.Users need to take a closer look at what they’re agreeing to. Every time you use a new service and have the option of signing in with Facebook or signing in another way, signing in with Facebook gives Facebook access to your data in the process.  What can regular Facebook users do to safeguard their personal data other than deactivating their account?The question for many people is really how can they exercise more control over what Facebook knows about them:This is a reversal of the way users’ relationship with Facebook should work. Why should users extract themselves from their social networks to protect themselves and their data, especially when the data users feed Facebook is Facebook’s lifeline?Tactical Tech’s Data Detox Kit, and other similar resources, are useful for anyone trying to learn more about how to control their data on such platforms.What can Facebook do to rebuild trust with its users?Between ongoing investigations into Facebook’s involvement in US and European elections, fake news, bots and other scandals from the last year, Facebook needs to do more than just promise to hire more people, make appearances at formal hearings, and offer apologies. In the light of these scandals, and others around violent content online, hatespeech, radical content, online harrassement and their inability to control it, Facebook needs to fundamentally reconsider its business model and also the checks and balances it has in place to deal with the political complexity of what goes on within their platform. For a company now connecting over a quarter of the planet, Facebook is no longer a neutral, irrelevant actor. It has a great responsibility to realise this fact. This means that small tweaks are no longer sufficient. They are one of the most profitable technology companies in the world and they have to invest some of their profits in solving these problems. Even former investors in Facebook are now saying they have to reconsider their business model.What measures should regulators be considering in response to this revelation?Facebook should be transparent about what political actors (parties, associated businesses) are paying for in terms of political targeting and advertising and how much money they are spending in the process. Additionally, spending on digital ads can be regulated, as ads on TV, radio, and print already are.There should also be transparency around how platforms handle political content such as political advertising. In some parts of the world, as in Europe, labeling a political ad as such is forbidden because it’s protected under freedom of speech, but online its quite difficult for most people to tell the difference.There’s an urgent need for citizens to understand how technology is affecting the democratic process. We at Tactical Tech are conducting an international related research study and publishing a report on this in June with the Oxford Internet Institute exploring how personal information is being used for political influence. We have analysed two dozen companies around the world doing work similar to Cambridge Analytica and are working with researchers in ten different countries to understand how major issues in technology have affected their local elections.Varoon Bashyakarla is a data scientist and Stephanie Hankey is a co-founder of Tactical Tech, a Berlin-based organisation working at the intersection of technology, human rights and civil liberties.  \nOpinions expressed in View articles do not reflect those of Euronews.","header":"Cambridge Analytica scandal: Users shouldn't have to leave social networks to protect themselves | View","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:36:15.924Z"},"time":"•\n    last updated:\n  \n  20/03/2018\n"}

On the document, SCL Global Clients — the parent company of Cambridge Analytica — highlights Russia on its client map.NBC News' U.K. partner was shown a slide presentation on electoral tactics that was allegedly shared with Lukoil, a Russian energy company.Cambridge Analytica maintained that they had no contact with Russians as recently as two days ago after ITN Channel 4 News inquired, and the data company also denied on Sunday that Nix had misled Parliament.Kogan, meanwhile, said he had the right to use the data for commercial purposes and did nothing wrong, according to ITN Channel 4 News.Related: Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data FirmWylie said that Kogan did not earn any money from sharing the data with Cambridge Analytica.MP Damian Collins, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee in parliament, responded to the new allegations against Nix on Sunday.\"It seems clear that [Nix] has deliberately mislead the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements, Collins said. \"We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments, and answer further questions relating to the links between GSR and Cambridge Analytica, and its associate companies.\"The new information reported on Saturday by ITN Channel 4 News, the New York Times and the Observer of London also drew a response in the United States, where Cambridge Analytica's data was used by the Trump campaign during the 2016 election — though the company claims none of the information used came from GSR's Facebook harvesting.\"This raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users, whether it acquired that information illegally and whether it sought to abuse that information in support of President Trump's political campaign in the United States or Brexit in the United Kingdom,\" said Rep.

We have the FAQs.\n    Just the FAQsCambridge Analytica, the political ad marketing firm that worked for President Trump and was involved in the misappropriation of 87 million Facebook users' data, is closing its offices.The specialist in political predictions announced that bankruptcy proceedings will begin in the U.S., as well as insolvency proceedings in the U.K, where the firm has an office and where its parent company The SCL Group is based.\n“Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company said in a statement Wednesday.The company came to public attention in March when Facebook announced — on the eve of two explosive newspaper reports in The New York Times and the U.K.'s  Observer — it had learned Cambridge Analytica and its parent company had failed to delete personal data that the social network knew it had improperly obtained on Facebook users three years ago.Cambridge, according to Facebook, had obtained the data from Aleksandr Kogan, a researcher at the University of Cambridge. A personality research app he created gathered the personal information on 270,000 Facebook users, as well as data on those users' friends, amplifying the reach to the tens of millions when it passed that data to Cambridge for a voter targeting scheme. Facebook said it thought Cambridge had deleted the data, but the Times' and Observer reports cited former employees and documents that the data was used to target voters during the 2016 presidential election. The disclosures forced Facebook into crisis mode as regulators and lawmakers clamored for an explanation and users started a #DeleteFacebook campaign. The giant social network eventually admitted it had been too loose with controls over its customers' data and ushered in a series of changes that gave Facebook's 2.2 billion members oversight over their personal information. It has continued to blame Cambridge Analytics and researcher Kogan for their actions, which they have denied. “This doesn’t change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn’t happen again,\" Facebook said in a statement sent to USA TODAY. \"We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities.\"Facebook said it planned an audit of Cambridge Analytica but was awaiting one from U.K. regulators. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix had been suspended in March after a series of TV broadcasts showed him making controversial statements about his firm's work on elections, including how Cambridge Analytica played a major role in Trump's presidential victory.The fortunes of Cambridge Analytica were closely tied to the Trump campaign's successful win for the White House, and some of the fallout from the Facebook data scandal has overlapped with federal investigations into that 2016 race. The firm claimed it could predict how people will vote based on the 5,000 pieces of data it collected on nearly every American adult combined with the results of thousands of personality surveys. It had touted its role as swinging the presidential election. Two of President Trump's biggest boosters, American hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer and former White House aide Steve Bannon, had invested in Cambridge Analytica. Bannon, who divested his stake in April, was also a vice president at the company from 2014 to 2016 and received a monthly consulting fee until 2016.While at the firm, Bannon began preparing for the 2016 election two years in advance, according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who testified before House Democrats in a closed-door session last month. Bannon directed the firm to test messages such as \"build the wall\" and \"drain the swamp\" and to test images and concepts for a U.S. audience relating to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian expansion in Eastern Europe, he testified.Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie arrives at the U.S. Capitol for a meeting with Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee April 25, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)Bannon was not concerned whether campaign ads created and promoted through Cambridge Analytica had false information because he was trying to win a \"culture war,\" Wylie testified. \"Cambridge Analytica was set up to be essentially a full-service propaganda machine,\" he said.Special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the firm to turn over its internal documents as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election.The concerns about potential misuse of data and digital marketing to undermine privacy extend beyond Cambridge Analytica to firms across the political spectrum, says Jeff Chester, executive director for privacy watchdog group Center for Digital Democracy.\"Rather than rejoicing that a bad actor has met its just reward, we should recognize that many more Cambridge Analytica-like companies are operating in the conjoined commercial and political marketplace,\" Chester said in a statement. \"Without a federal privacy law to protect consumer privacy online, and an empowered and emboldened FEC, Americans will continue to be victimized by the out-of-control 'Big Data' surveillance apparatus that is the core of our digital — and political — experience.\"Cambridge Analytica's bankruptcy is just the latest development in the continued fallout from the scandal, which extended this week to Facebook's headquarters. Jan Koum, founder and CEO of WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired four years ago for $16 billion, said Monday he was leaving Facebook and the company's board of directors. Koum's strong stance on privacy is seen as motivation for his departure.Also this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in April was peppered with questions about privacy during two Congressional hearings, announced new, upcoming Facebook features to address users' concerns. Among them: the ability to delete data Facebook gathers on you as you visit websites and apps.Cambridge Analytica maintained \"unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully,\" the company said Wednesday, but \"the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.\"That led to the decision to file for bankruptcy, the company says. \"Despite the Company’s precarious financial condition, Cambridge Analytica intends to fully meet its obligations to its employees, including with respect to notice periods, severance terms, and redundancy entitlements,\" it said.Cambridge Analytica, with offices in New York, Washington and London, has said it has 107 full-time employees. Most of the employees work in its central London headquarters.\nThe company decided to shut down because it was losing clients and had growing legal fees from the Facebook investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. .More: Cambridge Analytica active in elections, big data projects for yearsMore: Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: Steve Bannon used data to discourage Democratic turnoutFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n ","header":"Cambridge Analytica shutting down in wake of Facebook data crisis","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:37:16.401Z"},"time":"12:11 PM"}

The company's CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a personal hit of more than $15 billion just one day after the company said its growth is slowing.\n    USA TODAYFacebook suffered the largest one-day loss in Wall Street history following Wednesday's financial results for the first full quarter after Cambridge Analytica. Are users and investors unfriending Facebook because of the scandal? It's not that simple. What triggered the selloff?One word: Growth. Most companies would love to have the kind of financial results Facebook released after the market closed Wednesday. But investors have a different yardstick for fast-growing technology companies. In an earnings call with analysts, Facebook executives poured a bucket of ice-cold water on Wall Street expectations of fast revenue growth and fat profit margins which had propelled the stock to record highs. As a result, Facebook had its worst day in six years as a public company.Is Facebook's revenue growth slowing?Yes. Revenue increased 42 percent year over year which, while impressive, is the slowest growth rate since 2015. Facebook also missed Wall Street revenue estimates for the first time in three years.Making matters worse, Facebook warned that growth rates would decline for the rest of the year. Analysts were blindsided. \"Many investors are having a hard time reconciling that deceleration,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill told Facebook executives on the earnings call. So is the Cambridge Analytica scandal to blame?Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie arrives at the U.S. Capitol for a meeting with Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee April 25, 2018, in Washington, D.C. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images)Partly. People's feelings about Facebook soured after the company admitted that as many as 87 million people had their personal information improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a firm with ties to the Trump campaign. Even so, the stock had surged since the scandal broke in March, closing at a record $217.50 Wednesday before Facebook released its second-quarter financial results, the first full quarter since the scandal broke.But the results left no doubt that Cambridge Analytica and a barrage of other scandals have taken a serious toll, from the ongoing investigations into Russian manipulation of Facebook during the 2016 presidential election and relentless criticism over the spread of misinformation on Facebook, particularly in countries such as Myanmar and Sri Lanka, where that misinformation has exacted a deadly toll.  Is Facebook now paying for all these scandals?Yes. Wall Street was troubled by the rising costs of operating the business outpacing revenue growth. Some of that is from hiring a lot of workers, in part to combat problems on Facebook, including foreign election manipulation. It's also investing in video content, artificial intelligence and virtual reality. The Menlo Park, California, company had 30,275 people on the payroll as of June 30. That's a 47 percent increase from a year ago.Are people using Facebook less?It looks that way, though Facebook would say that's by design.Facebook is so massive – 2.23 billion people use it every month –  that it can't keep growing like a weed forever. But investors were unprepared for the figures Facebook released Wednesday that showed people are not hanging out on Facebook as much.The company posted the slowest growth rates to date in the number of people who use Facebook once a month and once a day. Also, growth flatlined in Facebook's biggest market, the U.S. and Canada, where it has 185 million daily users, and declined 1 percent in Europe, where it has 279 million daily users.  More: Bye Facebook, Hello Instagram: More users are breaking up with FacebookEven before Cambridge Analytica, USA TODAY surveyed dozens of social media users, and many of them said they started spending less time on Facebook after the bitterly divisive presidential election.But Facebook's growth had to slow  sometime. Many of the people who use the internet the world over are already on Facebook. The other factor that hurt Facebook in the second quarter: Europe implemented strict new data laws which Facebook says led to fewer daily visits from that region.Could this be good for Facebook users and Facebook?What investors see as downside could benefit Facebook users and Facebook in the long run. Facebook has gotten a bad rap for being too lax in safeguarding people's private information, failing to monitor and stop bad behavior on the platform and for letting misinformation run amok. Now it's owning up to those problems, and it's spending a lot of money to fix them. Facebook also said Wednesday that part of the reason revenue growth will slow is that Facebook is giving its users greater control over the privacy of their data, undercutting it's ad-targeting capabilities.  I own Facebook shares. Is there a silver lining?Yes, just ask Facebook. That silver lining is Facebook's other apps: Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook is counting on on these three apps, which each has more than 1 billion users, to drive future growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg hammered that point during the conference call with analysts with a big stat: 2.5 billion people use at least one of Facebook's apps every day.Instagram, in particular, is a bright spot. Facebook does not break out Instagram's revenue, but analysts believe it contributed significantly to second-quarter revenue. During the earnings call, Zuckerberg called the acquisition of Instagram \"amazing\" and said Instagram has grown twice as fast as it would have by being part of Facebook. He did not explain how he reached that conclusion.\"The company is still growing users, and although the Facebook platform is beginning to see slowing growth, the company’s other products are still seeing dramatic growth,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note.It's important to remember, too, that Facebook remains one of the top players in digital advertising, particularly mobile advertising, second only to Google. Mobile advertising made up 91 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue in the second quarter, up from 87 percent a year ago. ","header":"Why Facebook had its worst day ever (and yes, Cambridge Analytica is partly to blame)","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:38:19.321Z"},"time":"12:11 PM"}

Here is how to find out. Elizabeth Keatinge has more.\n    Buzz60WASHINGTON — Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told House Democrats that former Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon used the firm's research to discourage Democrats from voting in the 2016 election, according to testimony released Wednesday.Democrats from the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked Wylie in a closed-door session on Tuesday whether Bannon had specifically talked about voter disenfranchisement or disengagement.\"Yes,\" Wylie responded, according to the transcript released by the Democrats. \"If by that term you mean discouraging particular types of voters who are more prone to voting for Democratic or liberal candidates, if that’s what you mean by that term, then yes.\"Bannon could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Republicans on the committees did not join Democrats in questioning Wylie on Tuesday. Wylie also testified before Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday.Facebook recently revealed that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica, claiming the political consulting firm secured information on up to 87 million users without permission, through a personality quiz app from Global Science Research. Cambridge Analytica used that data to target voters during the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Trump campaign.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified for about 10 hours on Capitol Hill earlier this month as lawmakers pressed him to explain why the company didn't do more to protect users' privacy. Facebook disclosed the massive privacy breach after Wylie told reporters what had happened.Wylie told House Democrats this week that, as early as 2014, Bannon directed Cambridge Analytica to test messages such as \"build the wall\" and \"drain the swamp,\" which later became major slogans of the Trump campaign. Bannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica from June 2014 to August 2016, before joining the Trump campaign.\"Some of the things that emerged from that were — my understanding was that 'Drain the Swamp,' like, verbatim was tested, and used in some of the message testing,\" Wylie testified. \"(Border) walls were discussed.\"Wylie testified that Bannon directed Cambridge Analytica in 2014 to test images and concepts for an American audience relating to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian expansion in Eastern Europe. He said Putin was the only foreign leader used in the testing.Former White House adviser Steve Bannon delivers a speech during the French far-right Front National (FN) party annual congress on March 10, 2018 in Lille, France. (Photo: Sylvain Lefevre, Getty Images)\"I can’t explain why it was that they picked Vladimir Putin to talk about in focus groups or to do message testing or to do models on, and why that would be useful to Steve Bannon,\" Wylie told committee members.According to Wylie, Bannon said he didn't care if campaign ads created and promoted through Cambridge Analytica contained false information because he was trying to win a \"culture war.\"\"Cambridge Analytica was set up to be essentially a full service propaganda machine,\" Wylie testified.Wylie said Michael Flynn was a consultant for Cambridge Analytica and was hired to \"open doors\" and \"look at potential contracts\" in the United States and abroad. Flynn was a Trump campaign adviser and later served as the president's national security adviser before Trump fired him for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russians and is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Previously: Cambridge Analytica whistleblower to testify Wednesday to House Intel DemocratsMore: How Wisconsin GOP operative Mark Block linked Steve Bannon to Cambridge AnalyticaMore: After Facebook hearings, users want to know: who is protecting my data?  ","header":"Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: Steve Bannon used data to discourage Democratic turnout","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:38:44.943Z"},"time":"12:11 PM"}

We have the FAQs.\n    Just the FAQsLONDON — Cambridge Analytica, the British firm accused of improperly harvesting Facebook data to help Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency, and its parent company quietly worked behind the scenes in elections and on big data projects for years with clients that spanned the globe.In its 25 years of existence, the firm or its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories Group (SCL), has worked for political and military clients in Afghanistan, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Somalia and for the U.S. State Department.The State Department paid SCL nearly $500,000 in 2017 for information on how Islamic State extremist propaganda motivates recruits to commit terrorism, according to public data held by its Global Engagement Center unit. Cambridge Analytica’s investors have included Trump benefactor Robert Mercer and former White House aide Steve Bannon, two of Trump’s biggest boosters.Now the firm is under scrutiny for its information-gathering tactics.Facebook accuses the firm of harvesting private information improperly from 50 million of the social media site's users to make predictions about their likely voting habits. The breach was troubling enough to draw scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission.Special counsel Robert Mueller wants Cambridge Analytica to turn over its internal documents as part of his investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Britain's Parliament is investigating the firm's involvement in \"Brexit,\" the nation's 2016 referendum to leave the European Union.On Monday and Tuesday, British broadcaster Channel 4 aired a video of Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix saying his firm could entrap politicians in compromising situations, prompting British regulators to seek a warrant to inspect the company's databases and servers. Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix on Tuesday.The company denies any wrongdoing in the Facebook case. It said in a statement that it does not use, hold or have access to Facebook data or data from other social media platforms.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, said the social network had \"made mistakes\" over the scandal. \"I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform,\" he said in a Facebook post Wednesday.  Cambridge Analytica is the elections division of SCL. It has more than a dozen branches and offices around the world linked through a complex corporate structure with multiple shareholders. \"When you try to wind SCL back and figure out where it came from and how it got to where it is now, it's very difficult to do,\" said Martin Moore, director of the Center for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King's College London. SCL, founded in 1993 by former Saatchi \u0026 Saatchi advertising executive Nigel Oakes, has operated at least 18 separate companies in Britain and 12 in the United States, according to corporate filings in Britain and the U.S. compiled by Wendy Siegelman and Ann Marlowe, independent researchers in New York, and verified by USA TODAY. Some of these companies are now dormant or dissolved.SCL has 17 international offices, in such countries as Argentina and the United Arab Emirates. Cambridge Analytica says it has 107 full-time employees. Most of the employees work in its central London headquarters.Cambridge Analytica first emerged as an offshoot of SCL about five years ago, according to public filings.The company declined through a spokesman to comment on its corporate structure.Public records reveal a smattering of shareholders and some of its most prominent clientele.Cambridge Analytica's election work has been partly funded by Mercer, the American hedge fund billionaire, according to federal election data published by OpenSecrets.org. Mercer is a major contributor to conservative causes, including Breitbart News. Bannon, ousted White House chief strategist, was among the shareholders in a U.S.-based affiliate, Cambridge Analytica LLC.  Bannon, who divested his stake in April, held shares worth between $1 million and $5 million, according to his White House financial disclosure form. He was also a vice president at the company from 2014 to 2016 and received a monthly consulting fee until 2016.Bannon could not be reached for comment.President Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn disclosed in August that he held a brief advisory role with Cambridge Analytica. Flynn has pleaded guilty to a felony count of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with Russia's ambassador.The Trump campaign paid $6 million in 2016 to Cambridge Analytica to conduct large-scale polling and place hyper-targeted messages and online ads in front of U.S. voters in key swing states, Federal Election Commission records show.U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign paid Cambridge Analytica nearly $6 million for work before the company went to work for Trump, the records show.In most instances, SCL and Cambridge Analytica won't divulge who pays for its work. But case studies published on its website show the scope and complexity of SCL projects. \"I call (SCL) information mercenaries. They go wherever there is something to be done,\" said Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Switzerland-based mathematician who studies and campaigns for issues related to data protection and privacy through his organization PersonalData.IO.Dehaye has filed freedom of information requests in Britain to determine how Cambridge Analytica collects its data and whether that data extraction violates British law.\"There's no doubt they have been trying to manipulate data for their purposes,\" said David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University in England and an authority on propaganda.\"It's not clear how good they are at doing it,\" Miller said. \"The difficulty in understanding this organization is that a lot of what it says about itself turns out not to be to quite right.\"The Facebook case is lifting the veil on some of Cambridge Analytica's actions and tactics.The social media platform, which suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform on Friday, said the data analytics firm improperly received, used and then held onto user data passed to it by Cambridge University psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan.Kogan, Facebook claims, devised and then exploited a personality predictor application to get unsuspecting Facebook users to give away information about themselves and their Facebook friends.The app Kogan created, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" was downloaded only 270,000 times but was able to connect to other data points, such as \"likes\" and hometowns, for millions of other Facebook users through the app users' network of friends and family.He then passed the information to Cambridge Analytica for Trump's campaign.  Facebook has since changed its privacy policies to prevent such connections.Kogan told USA TODAY late last year that he had \"very limited knowledge\" of Cambridge Analytica's activities. He did not return a request for comment on the Facebook allegations or to further explain his side of the story. In an emailed reply to USA TODAY questions, Cambridge Analytica said it provided research, data science and digital and TV marketing services for Trump's campaign. The company said it used polling, voter files, early and absentee voting returns released by each state and both its own and Trump campaign data to compile more than 5,000 data points on 230 million American voters. The company said it did not use \"marketing psychology\" to target Trump supporters. Gary Coby, director of advertising at the Republican National Committee and a top media strategist on the Trump election campaign, said Cambridge Analytica was on the ground with the Trump social media team, sharing San Antonio office space with other Trump media execs, in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election.\"They had a lot of great people, really smart people,\" he said.But Coby downplayed the firm’s role in Trump’s victory. \"They helped on some surveying, some of the data sides, had multiple ad buying teams under me,\" Coby said.The campaign, as a whole, focused more on direct-response marketing — or getting voters to donate or volunteer immediately after seeing an ad — rather than “psychographic targeting,” he said. \"Psychographic targeting\" uses data points to create personality profiles of American voters that can then be reached with more targeted political advertising, a tactic Cambridge Analytica claims as a specialty. Around the time Cambridge Analytica began work for Trump, Nix, the company's CEO, reached out, via a public-speaking agency, to Julian Assange, the founder of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, seeking information about 33,000 missing emails belonging to candidate Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton.Cambridge Analytica said through a spokesperson who declined to be named that Nix made the approach to WikiLeaks to find what information it had and where it came from. The official said the company was not asked by the Trump campaign or anyone else, including Russia, to make the inquiry.Assange in a tweet confirmed the approach from Nix but said WikiLeaks never acted on the request. In October and November of 2016, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails allegedly stolen from Clinton's campaign boss John Podesta by Russian-linked hackers.Last December, the House Intelligence Committee, which had been investigating Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election, called on Nix to testify behind closed doors.On Tuesday, in a video broadcast on Britain's Channel 4, Nix is shown belittling representatives of the committee, saying Republican members asked him just three questions. \"After five minutes — done,\" he said. Contributing: Rick Jervis reported from Austin        ","header":"Cambridge Analytica active in elections, big data projects for years","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:39:05.518Z"},"time":"12:11 PM"}

Sonia Legg reports\n    NewslookCambridge Analytica, the political intelligence firm whose tactics came under fire and sparked a whirlwind of scrutiny over Facebook data, has submitted papers in the U.S. to begin liquidating.The company filed late Thursday to enter Chapter 7 bankruptcy. It was a widely expected decision after the firm had  started similar proceedings in United Kingdom courts.The move comes less than three weeks after Cambridge Analytica announced it would shut down, citing the debilitating controversy over its handling of some 87 million Facebook users' data and its aggressive political maneuvers, including past ties to the Donald Trump campaign.The company is also said to be under investigation by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller as he probes Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

We have the FAQs.\n    Just the FAQsThe Cambridge Analytica scandal has been in the headlines for weeks as a melodrama of political intrigue that normally would be a television mini-series. There is the misuse of social media data belonging to 50 million people; the conversion of that data into micro targeted political campaign marketing to help the Trump campaign; newspaper stories about the company and its aﬃliates working to manipulate elections in other parts of the world; and even sensational reports that company executives oﬀered to use prostitutes and bribery to discredit political opponents of clients.These stories will no doubt be fodder for the multiple investigations underway, as well as raising concerns about the impact of these kind of marketing tactics on our democracies. But embedded within this saga is a more fundamental point that should alert all of us to the way in which we have been caught up in a revolution — the explosive changes in the way our personal data is collected; integrated; analyzed and used to aﬀect our behavior. At stake is not just privacy, but actually freedom.More: Three homeland security lessons from Charlottesville: Michael ChertoffMore: Social media firms want us addicted to approval. So much for WiFi making us smarter.What the Cambridge Analytica story demonstrates first is that the data about us that is regularly harvested is not just what we wittingly post or transmit on line. The entering wedge of Cambridge Analytica’s data collection was an apparently limited request by a developer to have Facebook users complete an online survey. Slightly over a quarter of a million did so. But by downloading the survey, they opened the door to collection of data about all their friends and their other on-line interactions. As a result, data relating to approximately 50 million individuals was captured. The vast majority of these people did not know that their information was being used.Perhaps improperly, this data was transferred to Cambridge Analytica for the purpose of applying machine learning algorithms to correlate granular connections between individuals and their likely political predilections and interests. This analysis could then be applied for precisely targeted, individually focused political advertising aimed at potential voters. It is debatable whether this had an impact on the election outcome, but it is certain that political campaigns and even governments will continue eﬀorts to refine and apply the political marketing techniques.And the purpose of those techniques will not only be to aﬀect elections. As we have seen, information from Russia and other foreign powers has been used to create social division, sow public distrust, and even foment unrest. Weaponized data is the newest tool in the armory of subversion.More: You are not friends with Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. You are their product.POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, mediaWhat all this illustrates, as made concrete by the Cambridge Analytica aﬀair, is that personal data has become one of the most valuable assets of the modern age. That is evident from the fact that many of the companies with the highest market capitalization are essentially earning revenue from data adapted to commercial marketing. But the value of these data assets increasingly also lies in their utility as a tool to drive political behavior, impact social stability, and even aﬀect national security.Even more significant, the business of aggregating and reselling an individual’s data from multiple sources — social media, online searches, consumer purchases, and locational data — means that people will increasingly be subject to pressure to change their behavior from multiple sources: employers, insurers and governments. By way of example, China has embarked on a “social credit” plan to aggregate myriad data points of online and oﬀline behavior, and award individuals a “score” that will aﬀect their life prospects.For all of us what this means is that all the data we generate has become as valuable, and as worthy of safeguarding, as our money in the bank. Privacy — in the sense of shielding data from others — has been frayed given how easily third parties can collect and fuse our data. What must be protected now is our freedom of action, which requires that we take greater ownership and control of our data even when it is accessible to others.Part of the remedy will be adaptations in the law and regulation, changes that must allow for innovation but also the need to protect individuals from having their data abused or weaponized. When user data is collected by a platform to improve the user experience, consent should be readily presumed. But when the data is being used for other commercial purposes, or transferred to third parties, the law should mandate that the proposed new use of this data be clearly explained to the user, and the user’s affirmative approval should be required. Opting in or out of this kind of data sharing should always be the user’s choice, and should not be the result of pressure or deception. Finally, platforms should be required to describe and make available to the user all the types of data being collected about him or her.But the remedy also requires each of us becoming mindful of how and when we share our data. Sometimes that means we should not share data, or that we should actually pay for an online service instead of accepting a “free” benefit that we actually pay for with our personal information. We should also be careful about completing online surveys because the data we enter could wind up in different hands than we expect. Even more critical, we should consider that our online communications with friends may be harvested if those friends agree to grant access to their data. Finally, we must educate ourselves about the way data can be used to influence us, and to train ourselves to evaluate these message critically.At stake is our personal and national freedom.

Sonia Legg reports\nVideo provided by Reuters\n    NewslookWhat started with a Friday news dump has morphed into a full-blown crisis for Facebook.The social network disclosed Friday night it suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform after claiming it had improperly obtained information on 50 million user profiles.Cambridge Analytica has said any data obtained through Facebook was done so \"legally and fairly.\"Here's everything we know about the brewing scandal:On Friday, Facebook revealed the suspension of Cambridge Analytica, claiming the data firm secured information on user profiles through a personality quiz app from Global Science Research without permission. The app collected information such as hometown, content the users liked and their friends, as well as information from people's friends.The next morning, reports from The New York Times and The Observer of London surfaced alleging Cambridge Analytica used that data to target voters during the 2016 presidential election.More: Facebook apps may see more of your personal info than you want.

In a statement, Facebook said the company's top execs are \"working around the clock\" on a solution. \"The entire company is outraged we were deceived.\"Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly probing Facebook over how this user data was mishandled.Facebook is already under scrutiny over the impact of Russian ads run on its platform during the presidential election. Meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica was asked in December to turn over documents to special counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his investigation into possible Russian collusion. Beyond Russia, the incident has raised concerns over how well-equipped Facebook is at keeping data secure from third parties.One thing Facebook users should consider doing now is checking privacy settings to review which apps and services have Facebook permissions. If there's a service or app causing concern, users can revoke access.Of course, another option is to delete your Facebook account entirely.As Facebook shares plunge in the U.S., lawmakers seek hearings to look into what Facebook is doing to secure user data.

We have the FAQs.\n    Just the FAQsWhat’s not to like about Facebook, a company that’s all about liking and friending?Well, a lot, it turns out. Earlier this month The New York Times and Britain's The Guardian disclosed that data the company collected, ostensibly to allow for more targeted advertising, was swooped up and used to try to help elect Donald Trump.A company called Cambridge Analytica used (some would say weaponized) Facebook data to profile 50 million people without their consent. Those profiles were then used by the Trump campaign to bombard voters with content designed to promote Trump or disparage Hillary Clinton. Cambridge Analytica is said to have used similar tactics earlier in 2016 in an effort to persuade British citizens to vote for Britain’s exit from the European Union.Political groups have long used social media to target voters. But never have they been able to harvest such detailed information that could be used to predict users' political leanings and their likelihood of being swayed.Opposing view: Blame political operatives, not social media for privacy breachesCambridge Analytica did this by inviting users to participate in a personality test app. Then, amazingly and for reasons that are not entirely clear, it was able to gather detailed data not just on the 270,000 people who answered the questions, but also their 50 million friends.If nothing else, this episode should serve as a warning to users of social media that their data will be used for far more than generating more relevant ads. It almost certainly will be used again for nefarious political purposes. And it could be used to manipulate opinion on a host of issues.If there was any doubt about the morals of those collecting people’s private data, it was settled when Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix was caught (ironically, on a hidden camera) offering to entrap rivals of potential clients by secretly videotaping them with women that Cambridge Analytica would provide. Nix has since been suspended.The stakes are even higher for Facebook. If the social media site continues to maintain such a cavalier attitude about people’s data, enhanced regulation (particularly in Europe) will be the least of its worries. It will face a user rebellion.After initially balking, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before Congress next month. And on Wednesday, Facebook announced a new policy it says will make it easier for users to change their private settings. That's a start, but more will need to be done to repair what Zuckerberg acknowledged was \"a major breach of trust.\"With episodes like this, Facebook users are quickly changing their views about personal privacy and will no doubt move to disconnect data-harvesting apps. This will make Facebook less valuable to marketers.Over the longer term, users will begin to question why they are even providing so much free content that makes Facebook rich — while giving third parties a window into their lives.USA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.On Monday, a British TV news report cast it in a harsher light, showing video of Cambridge Analytica executives offering to entrap politicians. A day later, as a furor grew, the company suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix.[Read more about how Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign became linked]AdvertisementThe data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.[Read more about the internal tension at the top of Facebook over the platform’s political exploitation]Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was  not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.The daily Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry, plus exclusive analysis from our reporters and editors.Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”[Read more about how to protect your data on Facebook]Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.■The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement to keep users’ data private.Advertisement■ In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook’s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.■ A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook’s ties to Cambridge Analytica.■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post. Facebook’s lack of disclosure on the harvesting of data could violate privacy laws in Britain and several states.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

That was the basis the entire company was built on.”Among those whose personal data was hacked into in 2015 was the then opposition candidate, Muhammadu Buhari.Cambridge Analytica, according to the reports, worked with Israeli hackers who were instructed to get dirt on Muhammadu Buhari during the presidential campaign.According to those reports, SCL Elections, a public relations firm that later became Cambridge Analytica, manipulated Nigeria’s 2007 by organising campaigns to weaken the chances of opposition parties.“As part of its engagement, the company organised “anti-election rallies” to demoralise opposition supporters from voting in the elections, which saw the emergence of Umar Yar’Adua as Nigeria’s president.“The Cambridge Analytica team came up with a video to portray candidate Buhari as a leader who would enforce Sharia Law in Nigeria.It was intended to sway the minds of millions of Nigerians and vote for the PDP candidate.“”Currently, the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are the focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office, the United States Special Counsel Robert Mueller“Separately, the U K Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum,’’ the source further revealed.When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu said he had not been briefed on the issue.He, however, said Nigerians deserved answers immediately from the PDP administration, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica on how and why they improperly obtained and used data to interfere in Nigeria’s elections.He said an investigation should help to determine if there was a linkage between the various kilings and maimings that had characterized previous elections since 2007 and the misinformation activities of the Cambridge Analytica (CA) data flows.““It will also help President Buhari achieve his wish to leave a legacy of improved elections,’’ he added.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

It is instructive that the whistleblower who originated the allegation has been consistent in associating it to an unnamed businessman, who was neither linked to the party nor to the Jonathan campaign.“It is, therefore, deceitful for any pundit to blame the allegation on the PDP or anybody close to the former President, even before investigations were concluded.”Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

This is the same Presidency that recently informed Nigerians that President Buhari was delaying his declaration for 2019 for fear of political opponents.“Who is afraid of election? Is it the PDP or the President’s All Progressives Congress (APC) that has failed to conform with its constitutional provision of constituting a Board of Trustees (BoT); a party which is so afraid to conduct even internal election and had to extend the tenure of its executives because its stuck 2019 presidential candidate is even afraid of other possible contestants within its fold?“From the actions of the APC, it is manifest that the party is not only mortally afraid of elections but engaging in all manner of shenanigans to suppress opposition in our nation,” the party further noted.Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7ee4cc6dba1b08b5ab6c21"},"url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/presidency-asks-pdp-speak-cambridge-analytica/","content":"The Nigerian Presidency has advised the leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to  address the concerns raised about their role in the mass data harvesting at the heart of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal.Malam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, asked the PDP to respond to the story, and stop raising false alarms  to gain public sympathy and divert attention from its abysmal past record and failures.Reports said the a PDP billionaire member paid the UK firm, 2 million euro to, among other things,  hack into Candidate Muhammadu Buhari’s personal data in the run up to the 2015 general elections.“Nothing undermines a country’s democracy as such unfair practices”, Shehu said “That is why President Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment when they hacked into the opposition, Democratic Party records, and this is why a Special Counsel is investigating the alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election, and if President Donald Trump’s campaign is complicit in the attempted subversion of democracy in that country.“The PDP’s decision to drag the All Progressives Congress (APC) and INEC to the United Nations over alleged plan or plot to rig the 2019 general elections are not only laughable and puerile, but they also demonstrate the level of desperation that is haunting the opposition leaders.“President Muhammadu Buhari is passionately committed to free and fair elections in the country and for a man who joined forces with local and international observers to ensure a free and fair election which brought him to power in 2015, the President would under no circumstances tolerate any attempt to derail constitutional democracy.“The outcome of the gubernatorial elections in Edo, Ondo and Anambra States stand as clear examples of President Buhari’s commitment to free and fair elections in the country, and Nigerians should indeed be wary of PDP’s desperate propaganda.“For the PDP to be  preaching free and fair elections is like a street-walker preaching about chastity.“We must recall that the PDP  postponed the 2015 general elections in the guise of national security challenges because defeat was staring it starkly in the face. Despite the delay tactics, it was resoundingly defeated when the polls finally held.“The PDP has lost every moral ground and it is mortally afraid of facing the 2019 general elections because Nigerians will always remember their past and punish them one  more time for economically plundering the country.“The Cambridge Analytica hacking scandal committed against  Candidate Buhari by the PDP in 2015 in which billions of Naira was paid out to the Israelis and others hackers has shown that the former ruling party lacks both the integrity and credibility to talk about election rigging.“Instead of explaining their role in the scandal, the nation is greeted by stunning silence. Do they think this will simply blow away?“Rigging is PDP’s main area of core competence and its party leaders are drowning men who won’t mind clutching at any straw for political survival.“By  dragging the United Nations into its political propaganda, the PDP is indirectly suggesting that it is afraid to face the voters in 2019.“Rather than hiding behind allegations of a plot to rig the elections, the opposition party should work harder to win back the  trust of voters instead of spreading  false alarm to gain international sympathy.“It is unfortunate that the PDP is desperately trying all dirty tricks, including the exploitation of tragedy, for political advantage.”Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

This is as it warns that users should manage apps that they use and control access to the data those apps can see.Since the scandal of Cambridge Analytica’s alleged processing of user’s data for electoral manipulations broke out, several figures have been bandied on social media and other platforms about the number of Nigerian users Cambridge Analytica had access to their data.Facebook has officially confirmed that about 78 Nigerian users were directly involved as they installed the app provided by Cambridge Analytica while 271,469 users were potentially impacted in Nigeria because they are friends to those who would have installed the app elsewhere in the world.However, a facebook spokesperson who pleaded anonymity has warned Nigerians to manage the apps they use to forestall future occurrence.“We want to encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show people what apps their accounts are connected to and control what data they’ve permitted those apps to use through app settings. We are putting a link at the top of people’s News Feeds to make sure that everyone sees it. Furthermore, it’s important for us to tell people if and how their data may have been accessed via This Is Your Digital Life,” he added.He revealed that Facebook is taking numerous measures. One of those being that everyone globally on their Facebook page will see an alert leading them to the apps setting where they can review the apps they’ve allowed access to their data.Additionally, those potentially impacted by CA will also see the alert that will take them to see what data might have been shared.Apparently to increase transparency, accountability and maybe prevent election interference, Facebook also announced changes to the way advertisements are managed both on its platform and on Instagram.Vice-President in charge of Ads at facebook, Rob Goldman and his counterpart for Local \u0026 Pages, Alex Himel, said Facebook has realised that users hardly know who or where advertisements on the platform are coming from and therefore has decided to correct that mistake.They said: “We believe that when you visit a Page or see an ad on Facebook, it should be clear who it’s coming from. We also think it’s important for people to be able to see the other ads a Page is running, even if they’re not directed at you.“That’s why today we’re announcing important changes to the way we manage ads and Pages on Facebook as well as Instagram. These are designed to increase transparency and accountability, as well as prevent election interference”.Last October, the platform announced that only authorized advertisers will be able to run electoral ads on Facebook or Instagram. Now, the company is extending that requirement to anyone that wants to show issue ads, like political topics being debated across the country. Facebook is working with third parties to develop a list of key issues, which the company said it will refine over time.The platform has also said that to get authorized, advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location even as they will be prohibited from running political ads,  electoral or issue-based, until they are authorized.In addition, Facebook said that such ads will be clearly labelled in the top left corner as Political Ad and marked as “paid for by” information.The company started testing the authorization process this week, and people will begin seeing the label and additional information in the US later this spring.Facebook is also investing in artificial intelligence and adding more people to help find advertisers that should have gone through the authorization process but did not. The company realized it won’t catch every ad that should be labeled, and it encourages anyone who sees an unlabeled political ad to report it. People can do this by tapping the three dots at the top right corner of the ad and selecting “Report Ad.”Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

The Nigerian government is probing claims that Cambridge Analytica, a British-based political consultancy, illegally used Facebook data in past election campaigns for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). In a press statement released Sunday, the Nigerian government said it was probing whether the firm broke the law to wage “a campaign to perpetuate discord and hack into personal records of the then leading opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari.”The campaign also included “anti-election rallies” and a gory video depicting Buhari as an Islamic fundamentalist on a quest to enforce Sharia law in Nigeria, said the statement.  “He wasn’t aware of it,” spokesman Ikechukwu Eze said on Thursday, referring to former president Jonathan. When asked about the probe, Eze replied: “The best thing to do is to wait for the conclusion of the investigation.”Jonathan was elected president in 2010, losing to the present incumbent, Buhari, in 2015.Regulators in Britain and the United States are investigating claims that Cambridge Analytica unlawfully used Facebook data for political ends in a mushrooming privacy scandal that has cast the spotlight on data protection.

The company was also hired by the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2015 elections.The UK Foreign Office said it was unaware of this alleged activity before SCL was awarded British government contracts in 2008.Cambridge Analytica says it is looking into the allegations about SCL.In the document, SCL Elections claimed potential clients could contact the company through “any British High Commission or Embassy”.It also claims SCL received “List X” accreditation from the UK’s Ministry of Defence which provided “Government endorsed clearance to handle information protectively marked as ‘confidential’ and above”.The document claims SCL Elections deliberately exploited ethnic tensions in Latvia in the 2006 national elections in order to help their client.SCL also claims that ahead of the elections in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010, it orchestrated an “ambitious campaign of political graffiti” that “ostensibly came from the youth” so the client party could “claim credit for listening to a ‘united youth’”.Most of the examples detailed in the brochure took place before the British government entered into at least six contracts with SCL.The former Labour Foreign Office Minister and Cabinet minister Lord Hain has tabled a written question in the House of Lords on Monday for urgent clarification on the matter of Embassy endorsement.He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show that the SCL case was “lifting the lid on a potential horror story” of other companies using data to manipulate voters.The Ministry of Defence has confirmed SLC were given a provisional List X accreditation but had not had it since 2013.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “It is not now nor ever has been the case that enquiries for SCL ‘can be directed through any British High Commission or Embassy’.”“Our understanding is that, at the time of the signing of the contract for project work in 2008/9, the FCO was not aware of SCL’s reported activity during the 2006 Latvian election or 2007 Nigerian election.”In a statement, the acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexander Tayler, said “Cambridge Analytica was formed in 2013, out of a much older company called SCL Elections.“We take the disturbing recent allegations of unethical practices in our non-US political business very seriously. The board has launched a full and independent investigation into SCL Elections’ past practices, and its findings will be made available in due course.”Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”Among those whose personal data was hacked into in 2015 was the then opposition candidate, Muhammadu Buhari.Contacted on the issue, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said although he had not been briefed on the issue, Nigerians deserved answers immediately from the PDP administration, Facebook and Cambridge Analytica on how and why they improperly obtained and used data to interfere in Nigeria’s elections.According to him,”an investigation should help to determine if there is a linkage between the various killings and maimings that have characterized our elections since 2007 and the misinformation activities of the Cambridge Analytica (CA) data flows. It will also help President Buhari achieve his wish to leave a legacy of improved elections.”APC chasing shadows—PDPReacting to to the issue last night, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said APC and its Federal Government are chasing shadows in their “desperate” plot to implicate it in the alleged hacking into the personal record of its then Presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari.The party said while it welcomed an open investigation into the Cambridge Analytica saga, it demanded that such inquest be extended to cover the sources of the looted funds used to prosecute President Buhari’s campaign in 2015.“It is public knowledge that the document being relied upon by the APC clinically stated that there is no suggestion that Jonathan knew of the covert operation.“We are, therefore, aware that this new agenda is to divert public attention from the various scandalous allegations hanging on the neck of the Buhari Presidency, including the use of looted funds to finance his 2015 Presidential election, the Martin Luther Kings award saga, the damaging Bill Gates’ verdict on the Buhari’s economic policies as well as the numerous financial scandals in the NNPC under his watch.“This inquest should, therefore, be completely open and independent of government control, so that Nigerians will know the truth, not only on the Cambridge Analytica saga, but also on the source of funds for the President’s 2015 campaign and other sleazes under his watch,” the party said. Over the years, we have shouted ourselves hoarse over the precarious situation of the Apapa ports infrastructure and the...I met with Doctor Patterson, possibly the best eye surgeon in Canada.

To date thousands of apps have been investigated and around 200 have been suspended — pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.”Archibong added that, “where we find evidence that these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and notify people via this website.”“There is a lot more work to be done to find all the apps that may have misused people’s Facebook data — and it will take time,” he said.HMD Global, home of Nokia phones, presents Snake using Facebook’s new camera AR platformWhy I killed my girlfriend I met on Facebook – Suspect confessesWhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook users to start paying tax – ParliamentFacebook closes 583 million fake accountsFacebook: Mark Zuckerberg reveals plans to add dating serviceCambridge Analytica: How to check whether Facebook shared your dataCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","header":"Cambridge Analytica: Facebook suspends 200 apps over misuse of data","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:49:36.322Z"},"time":"\nPublished\non May 15, 2018\n\n"}

The report had no evidence to suggest the Jonathan was involved.“I know former President Jonathan enjoyed a lot of goodwill in a number of places. What the report said was that a billionaire who was Jonathan’s friend and a couple of his agents met them and asked them to find information in an illegal manner.“I think what should be done is to establish the name of this Nigerian billionaire and pose these questions to them and not to us,” he added.Revealing how the PDP got information about Buhari’s medical and academic record that the PDP vehemently pointed out during the 2015 election campaigns, Fani-Kayode attributed this to his prowess as a historian and a professional who ask a lot of questions.He clearly pointed out that the PDP was not in the business of hacking into people’s personal information data or employing others to do so.Osun Assembly member dumps APC for PDP, Aragbesola’s appointee resignsBuhari carpets his critics, APC chieftains who joined PDPPDP does not have corrupt-free person like Buhari – OnochieAPC ex-BoT member, Nkire joins PDPWhat should happen to Akpabio over Adolf Hitler comment – PDPAPC vs PDP: Fani-Kayode reacts to Akpabio’s ‘Hitler invasion’ in 2019Copyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","header":"Fani-Kayode speaks on PDP’s involvement in Cambridge Analytica scandal","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:50:18.365Z"},"time":"\nPublished\non March 26, 2018\n\n"}

That has not been reported, although Channel 4 has undercover footage that they haven’t been able to put in the public domain of Alexander Nicks talking about the relationship with Black Cube.“Black Cube, on the Nigerian, project was engaged to hack the now president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, to get access to his private medical records and his private emails.“Aggregate I.Q (AIQ) worked on that project. AIQ was handed material in Nigeria from Cambridge Analytica to distribute online. That’s distribution of kompromat and of incredibly threatening and violent video content, which I’ve passed on to the committee.“The video that AIQ distributed in Nigeria with the sole intent of intimidating voters included content where people were being dismembered, where people were having their throats cut and bled to death in a ditch.“They were being burned alive, there was incredibly anti-Islamic and threatening message portraying Muslims as violent. This is again…(interjects self). So you’ve got Aggregate I.Q which received 40 per cent of the vote leave funding (referring to the UK referendum on Brexit) also working on projects that involved hacked material, compromised and distributing violent videos of people being bled to death to intimidate voters and this is the company that played an incredibly pivotal role in politics here (UK).“And so, something that I will strongly recommend to the committee is that they actually not only push the authority here but give them the support that they need in order to actually investigate this company and what they were doing in Brexit,” he saidBut in a statement issued after the hearing, Black Cube said it has always operated within the law.“Whilst we are flattered that we are seemingly being connected with every international incident that occurs, we will state that Chris Wylie’s testimony is a flagrant lie.“We categorically declare that neither Black Cube, nor any of its affiliates and subsidiaries, have ever worked for, or engaged with, SCL, Cambridge Analytica, or any of their affiliates and subsidiaries.“Black Cube has never operated in Nigeria nor has it worked on any project connected to Nigeria, and none of its employees has ever set foot in Nigeria.“Black Cube will investigate this claim on a pro bono basis, and will reveal the truth and the motive behind Wylie’s defamatory lie,” Black Cube said.Buhari carpets his critics, APC chieftains who joined PDPPDP does not have corrupt-free person like Buhari – OnochieSaraki: Middle Belt Forum blows hot, warns Buhari over Miyetti AllahBuhari still under pressure to reinstate ex-DSS DG, DauraMy father trekked 1 mile a day at 97 – Charlyboy mocks Buhari2019: How Buhari can fund election without National Assembly approval – SagayCopyright © Daily Post - Nigeria News","header":"Whistle blower reveals firm that hacked President Buhari’s emails","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:50:55.821Z"},"time":"\nPublished\non March 28, 2018\n\n"}

Facebook declined immediate comment.In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.”The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery.Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend.Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking.The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law.

In the last few days, Cambridge Analytica, which claims to use data to change behaviour including that of voters, has been accused of breaching Facebook rules in its efforts to collect personal data and use them to bring Donald Trump to power.Cambridge Analytica is accused of interfering in elections on a very broad canvas. In Nigeria, it’s said to have used underhand tactics to try and secure the re-election of then President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015.Allegations in Kenya have focused on claims that Cambridge Analytica helped president Uhuru Kenyatta to retain power in 2017 by designing divisive campaigns that demonised opposition candidate Raila Odinga, bringing the country closer to civil conflict.But caution is required, at least when it comes to the stories about interference in Nigeria and Kenya. The company’s impact has in fact been massively exaggerated as a result of claims made by Cambridge Analytica itself.Speaking about the campaign of Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party, managing director Mark Turnbull has been caught on camera claiming to have “staged the whole thing”. Unsurprisingly, given the willingness of employees of the firm to talk about the use of underhand strategies such as honey traps and fake news, opposition leaders are up in arms. National Super Alliance official Norman Magaya has called for a full investigation into Cambridge Analytica’s role, accusing it, and the ruling party, of trying tosubvert the people’s will.But while such investigations need to be conducted and questions raised by the opposition need to be answered, we should also ask a prior question: can Cambridge Analytica deliver on its claims?The evidence from Africa is no.This is not to say that Cambridge Analytica doesn’t present a threat to democracy, or that it should not be ashamed of itself or face investigation. But it is to say that its impact in Africa has been over-hyped because it serves a variety of interests to do so.Failures in Nigeria and Kenya In Nigeria, the company was brought in to save President Jonathan by wealthy supporters desperate for him to stay in power. It failed. In the 2015 elections, Jonathan became the first ever Nigerian leader to lose at the ballot box. In fact he didn’t only lose. He was soundly beaten by an opposition party competing with one hand tied behind its back in a political system that conferred massive advantages of incumbency.There are also reasons to think that the company’s impact has been overstated in Kenya. It is true that Kenyatta was eventually declared the winner of the election – though the first contest was nullified by the Supreme Court for procedural irregularities and the opposition did not take part in the re-run – but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica’s much vaunted ability to manipulate “big data” was the reason for this.Take the question of targeted social media campaigns. It is true that material was circulated attacking Odinga as a dangerous and irresponsible leader. Cambridge Analytica may have advised the government to adopt this strategy – although we know that some of the worst videos were actually made by another company Harris Media.But even if they did, there are two reasons to doubt that it was a new or particularly effective tactic.First, these messages do not appear to have been targeted. Ahead of the elections, and as part of a comparative research project on elections in Africa, we set up multiple profiles on Facebook to track social media and political adverts, and found no evidence that different messages were directed at different voters. Instead, a consistent negative line was pushed on all profiles, no matter what their background.Second, the vast majority of Kenyans are not on Facebook, and so there is no reason to think that messages circulated in this way would swing the wider electorate. Instead, surveys show that radio remains the major source of information, and that Kenyans are highly sceptical of the reliability of social media.In other words, the campaign led by Cambridge Analytica does not seem to have been that different to the ones that preceded it. For all the claims of a hi-tech innovative strategy, their real role appears to have been to advocate negative campaigning. But there is nothing new about this.Back in 2007, when Raila Odinga’s opposition appeared to be on the brink of winning power, his rivals claimed that his victory would lead to the country’s collapse and circulated flyers with his head superimposed on Idi Amin’s body to drive the point home. This was well before Cambridge Analytica was even formed, and stands as proof that Kenyan leaders don’t need foreign consultants to tell them the value of ethnic scaremongering.It is also important to keep in mind that you cannot simply use messaging to win votes in a system in which the ethnicity, patronage and credibility of candidates are major drivers of voter behaviour. To mobilise voters to the polls, leaders reinforce their support base by attending funerals and giving generously to the bereaved; attending church and contributing to building funds; turning up at parent-teacher meetings and paying school fees for poor children.To show generosity at these events is to demonstrate that the candidate acknowledges the morality of voters’ claims and will not forget them once elected. If you don’t do this you will not win, no matter what your PR team is doing.Exaggerated claims The tendency to exaggerate Cambridge Analytica’s powers is no accident. Exaggerated claims are part and parcel of the company’s marketing strategy. For journalists, the more powerful the company, the bigger the story. For opposition parties, the more effective Cambridge Analytica is seen to be, the more it can be blamed for an electoral defeat.There is also something more profound at work: the suspicion that Africa is the victim of European or American schemes is a powerful one. Many, in Africa and elsewhere, will see this as further evidence of that eternal truth. And we are all increasingly suspicious of the power of big data, uneasily aware that we may not have fully grasped the small print of our deal with the tech companies.We may have good reason for that suspicion – but we should beware of flattering those firms by exaggerating their power and reach.*  Gabrielle Lynch is Professor of Comparative Politics at the University of Warwick; Justin Willis is Professor of History at Durham University and Nic Cheeseman is Professor of Democracy at the University of Birmingham.** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.The ConversationNational Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Take Cambridge Analytica's role in Africa with a pinch of salt","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:53:17.382Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

The data was then used to help target or manipulate voters with personalised political advertising.Wylie is a Canadian-born national and has been working with Observer journalist, Carole Cadwalladr for almost a year. His one aim: To expose Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The date scientist was working at Cambridge Analytica on President Donald Trump's election team and the assisted on work related to the UK during the EU referendum.He was providing Cadwalladr with leaks for almost a year as an anonymous source. Cadwalladr was the person who convinced him to go public. Wylie has been seen as the millennials' first great whistle-blower, even though he left school without any qualification.FACT-SHEETADHD, Dyslexia and no educationWylie left school at the age of 16. He was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but found himself embroiled in politics after really understanding how the internet works, according to the Observer. Canada/US PoliticsAt the age of 17, Wylie was already working in Canadian politics. He then started learning all things data from the President Obama’s national director of targeting.He taught himself to code and at the age of 20, he was ensiled at the prestigious London School of Economics. While studying he worked for the UK’s Liberal Democrats. He assisted with upgrading their databases and voter targeting system. His connections at the Liberal Democrats helped him connect with people that would then form Cambridge Analytica.He was responsible for testing all of Cambridge Analytica’s “crazy ideas” after he realised that people personal preferences online could be used to analyse how they viewed politics. Connecting the dots to Steve BannonBannon was on a plane and was sitting next to a cyberwarfare expert when he heard about Wylie and his work at SCL Group, that would later become Cambridge Analytica.At the time Bannon was still the editor of Breitbart News but saw an idea here and teamed up with hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer. Mercer, Bannon, Wylie and Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix worked together to create Cambridge Analytica.This super team then connected with the University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan and his company, Global Science Research. The team then took Facebook data and created a personality test app that was aimed at targeting US voters. \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" Wylie confessed.RemorseIn 2014 Wylie left Cambridge Analytic and then went to Facebook in 2016 to inform them of the data breach. \"All I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\" Wylie said about the letter he received from the company's lawyers. \"Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.\"Facebook’s retaliationFacebook was contacted by the Observer last week when these allegations became public. The social media company then suspended Cambridge Analytica. Facebook then blocked Wylie from accessing his own Instagram and Facebook accounts. In a statement Facebook said: \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook.\" The ravenous' gay veganCadwalladr said she would describe Wylie as: \"Clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, and compelling.”She sees him as a master storyteller and a “politicker”. \"She said Wylie describes himself as the gay Canadian vegan who ended up creating Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindf--k tool.\"On Tuesday Wylie tweeted that he had accepted an invitation to testify before US House Intelligence Committee, the US House Judiciary Committee \u0026 the UK Parliament Digital Committee. He said, “it’s time for our democratic institutions to take control”.WATCH: Wylie sits down with CBS News-BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Meet the guy who blew the lid on Facebook's data breach","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:53:37.218Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

Twitter said GSR paid for the access; it provided no further details.Explanations NeededTwitter provides certain companies, developers and users with access to public data through its application programming interfaces (APIs), or software that requests and delivers information. The company sells the data to organizations, which often use them to analyze events, sentiment or customer service.Enterprise customers are given the broadest data access, which includes the last 30 days of tweets or access to tweets from as far back as 2006. To get that access, the customers must explain how they plan to use the data, and who the end users will be.Twitter doesn’t sell private direct messaging data, and users must opt-in to have their tweets include a location. Twitter’s “data licensing and other revenue” grew about 20 percent, to $90 million, in the first quarter.Social media companies have come under intense scrutiny over reports that Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users. Companies like Twitter tend to have access to less private information than Facebook. The latter has said that Cambridge Analytica, which worked for President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, may have harvested data on 87 million users.Personality QuizAbout 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s personality quiz app, which shared information the people and their friends that was then improperly passed to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has testified in front of Congress about the misuse of data, and lawmakers have called on Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify as well.Criticism of Twitter’s failure to prevent misinformation and abuse on its platform has risen since the 2016 election. In the first quarter, the company removed more than 142,000 applications connected to the Twitter API that was collectively responsible for more than 130 million “low-quality” tweets during the period. The company has also limited the ability of users to perform coordinated actions across multiple accounts.READ ALSO: Twitter will be implementing new measures to stop bad behaviourREAD ALSO: Twitter beats Wall Street estimatesTOP STORY: Sarb fires a broadside at Viceroy- BLOOMBERGNational Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Twitter sold data access to Cambridge Analytica","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:53:59.223Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway US voters before and after the 2016 elections. “It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” Democratic US Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted. “They say ‘trust us.’ Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,” she added. Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation. Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers. “The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor, who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data. Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users. “It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said. Democratic US Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.” “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said. With Republicans controlling the Senate, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail. The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted, despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015. Some 270000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said. Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information. Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action. Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it. Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted that the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.” Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied. Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy \u0026 Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, DC, said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse. Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday.

The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behaviour of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Read more: A new threat to Facebook’s reputationNow, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analytica.The firm’s psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, have done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.Also read: Norwegian government faces no confidence vote after minister's FB postBut in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” he told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?'”The most damning footage, though, was of Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Nix and Turnbull “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. This month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But after the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Collins, chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.The New York TimesNational Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"#CambridgeAnalytica's dirty tricks go beyond data harvesting","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:54:43.116Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

Cambridge Analytica will later address Kogan's remarks at a briefing.CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICACambridge Analytica is also under scrutiny over campaigning for the 2016 referendum when Britons voted to leave the European Union.Kogan said that former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who was also a director of the consultancy's parent firm SCL Group, had previously lied to lawmakers when he said he had not received data from Kogan.\"We certainly gave them data, that's indisputable,\" Kogan told lawmakers. Asked if Nix had lied, Kogan answered: \"Absolutely.\"Kogan hired a market research firm called Qualtrics to recruit 200,000 to 300,000 people to take the quiz to collect the data, resulting in expenses of $600,000-$800,000. Kogan's company was paid 230,000 pounds ($320,643.00) by SCL for its predictive analysis based on the findings, Kogan said.However he added that he thought it was unlikely that SCL used the data for the Trump campaign, after he heard that it had not yielded good results when it was deployed in Republican candidate Ted Cruz's campaign.Kogan said that he never drew a salary from GSR, the company that he founded to do the research that was wound up last year. Most of the money received from SCL was spent on coding work, acquiring data and legal fees. He was allowed to keep the data he gathered on the project.Kogan said that GSR had a close relationship with Facebook, and one of his partners at the firm, Joseph Chancellor, now worked for the social media giant.Kogan added that Facebook's allegations that he ran a scam, was a fraud and a liar amounted to crisis PR.\"PR is PR,\" he said. \"It's convenient for them to point the finger.\"National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Researcher in Facebook scandal says: my work was no good for targeted advertising","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:55:04.079Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

Cambridge Analytica tried to make me pay for that work but I refused. It had nothing to do with us,\" Banks was quoted as saying.Efforts by the ICO to investigate Cambridge Analytica had hit a snag on Thursday after a judge adjourned its application to search the British consultancy group's office by 24 hours.U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the British consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.Facebook's Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company made mistakes in mishandling data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers access to data. National Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Investigators search Cambridge Analytica's London office","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:55:22.325Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

The company could not easily obtain such data through its own means, so it harvested data from Facebook instead.By creating the app “thisisyourdigitallife” in 2015, University of Cambridge psychology professor Dr. Aleksandr Kogan obtained permission to access user account data and information about the friends of each person who downloaded the app. In a statement, Facebook said, “Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time.”Recently,  Facebook faced new calls for regulation from within US Congress and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards.The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway US voters before and after the 2016 elections.“It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” Democratic US Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted. “They say ‘trust us.’ Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,” she added.READ ALSO: A new threat to Facebook's reputation READ ALSO: Twitter joins Google and Facebook by banning cryptocurrency adsTOP STORY: I am broke, says Robert Mugabe- BUSINESS REPORT ONLINENational Arts Council chairperson called K-word, assaultedDA councillor slammed over 'dirty dangerous Durban' postMalema's stern warning to Trump: Stay out of SA's land affairsKaizer Chiefs sign another player, Gordinho latestDonald Trump orders probe into South Africa's #LandExpropriationSign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.","header":"Facebook stock down 7% after data leaks scandal","parent_keyword":"cambridge analytica","scraped_time":{"$date":"2018-08-24T00:55:43.109Z"},"time":"Thu 23 Aug"}

(Leah Millis/Reuters)Cambridge Analytica, the British marketing analytics firm, announced on Wednesday that it was closing and would file for insolvency in Britain and the United States after failing to recover from the Facebook data scandal.The decision follows weeks of intense pressure on the company, hired by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, after allegations emerged it may have hijacked up to 87 million Facebook users’ data.It claimed it has been “vilified” by the “numerous unfounded accusations” which torpedoed its business and left the firm with “no realistic alternative” but to go into administration.“Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully ... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers,” it said in a statement.“As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.”An affiliate of British firm Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), CA has offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia.It drew attention after former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon reportedly once sat on its board and was bankrolled to the tune of $15-million by US billionaire and Republican donor Robert Mercer.\nIt first became embroiled in scandal in March when Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old former analyst for the firm, revealed it had created psychological profiles of tens of millions of Facebook users via a personality prediction app.The revelations instantly reverberated around the world, wiping billions from the social media giant’s market value and drawing scrutiny from politicians and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.To make matters worse for CA, CEO Alexander Nix was suspended within days after he was filmed by undercover reporters bragging about ways to win political campaigns, including through blackmail and honey traps.As the crisis intensified, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg was forced to apologise to its billions of users amid a small but growing exodus from the site.He eventually appeared before Congress for a two-day grilling by lawmakers, and has since vowed to overhaul the way the Facebook shares its users’ data.In Britain, regulators ratcheted up a probe into CA, raiding its London offices, and later extending the investigation to 30 organisations, including Facebook.A second whistleblower from the firm also emerged at a parliamentary hearing in April claiming Britons’ personal data may have been misused by a pro-Brexit campaign ahead of the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union.Earlier this month, Facebook upped its count of the number of people impacted, admitting that up to 87 million users may have had their data harvested.CA has vehemently denied exploiting that data for Trump’s election campaign, claiming it deleted data obtained in breach of the social network’s terms of service.At a London press conference last week a CA spokesman claimed the company was “no Bond villain” and had broken no laws.It hired British barrister Julian Malins to conduct an independent investigation into what it termed “a torrent of ill-informed and inaccurate speculation” and posted his report on its website Wednesday. “(The) report ... concluded that the allegations were not ‘borne out by the facts’,” CA said.“(It) has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” it added.  But the company conceded the crisis had taken too heavy a toll and said its board had appointed lawyers in Britain to oversee the insolvency process, and would be following suit in America.CA said that although its financial condition was “precarious” it intended “to fully meet its obligations to its employees”Initial reaction to the news in Britain was guarded. Damian Collins MP, chair of a parliamentary committee that held the hearings on the issue and questioned Nix in February and Facebook executives last month, warned CA “cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing”. “The investigations into their work are vital,” he added.© Agence France-PresseGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Reuters)It was one of hundreds of cute questionnaires that were shared widely on Facebook and other social media, like “Which Pokeman Are You?” and “What Are Your Most Used Words?”This one, an app called “thisismydigitallife”, was a personality quiz, asking questions about how outgoing a person is, how vengeful one can be, whether one finishes projects, worries a lot, likes art, or is talkative.About 320 000 people took the quiz, designed by a man named Alexsandr Kogan.Kogan was contracted to do it by a company called Cambridge Analytica, founded by US Republican supporters including Steve Bannon, who would become the strategist for Donald Trump.Because Kogan’s app was circulated via Facebook, it reaped far more than just the information on those who took the test. At the time, in 2015, such apps could scrape up all the personal details of not only the quiz-taker, but all their Facebook friends.\nThat ultimately became a horde of data on some 50 million Facebook users – their personal information, their likes, their places, their pictures, and their networks.Marketers use such information to pitch cars, clothes, and vacations with targeted ads. It was used in earlier elections by candidates to identify potential supporters.But for Kogan and Cambridge it was a much bigger goldmine. They used it for psychological profiling of US voters, creating a powerful database that helped carry Trump to victory in the 2016 presidential election.The data let the Trump campaign know more than perhaps anyone has ever known about Facebook users, creating targeted ads and messaging that could play on their individual biases, fears and loves – effectively creating a bond between them and the candidate.The project was based on the work of a former Cambridge scientist, Michal Kosinski, who studies people based on what information they generate on line. Kosinski and fellow researcher David Stillwell had for several years tapped into Facebook for psychometric profiling using their own personality test app, “myPersonality”. The app accumulated six million test results, along with users’ Facebook profiles, and their friends’ profiles, in a powerful research database.In 2015 they published a study carrying the bold title: “Computer-based personality Judgments are more accurate than those made by humans.”They showed, for example, that they could divine a fairly accurate psychometric portrait of a person using only their Facebook “likes”. “Computers outpacing humans in personality Judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy,” they wrote.Kosinski would not share the database with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, reportedly knowing it would be used for a political campaign. But Kogan created his own app quiz and, through that, amassed the database on 50 million people that would be the backbone of Trump’s social media campaign.Facebook now says Kogan did that illegally. And it has since also restricted apps from such broad data collection on friend networks.But Cambridge Analytica proved that Kosinski’s methods were powerful.They started with the standard psychological profiling test known as Big Five or OCEAN, which measures five traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.The test-taker answers a list of statements like “I am someone who tends to be organized” or “who rarely feels excited” or “has few artistic interests,” using a scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”.Those basic results were combined with the data raked from Facebook profiles and friend networks, associating longer lists of traits. For example, to categorize voters, an algorithm could find links between “agreeableness” or “neuroticism” and gender, age, religion, hobbies, travel, specific political views, and a host of other variables.The data generated an incredible 4 000 or more data points on each US voter, according to Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive before he was suspended on Tuesday.The power of psychographic data, experts say, is not in the granularity itself, but in combining data to make significant correlations about people – something with requires powerful computer algorithms.Ultimately, it allowed the campaign to know far more about voters than anyone ever has before.The output was put to work in what Nix called “behavioral microtargeting” and “psychographic messaging”. More simply said, the campaign could put out messages, news and images via Facebook and other social media that was finely targeted to press the right buttons on an individual that would push them into Trump’s voter base.For Trump, it worked.“If you know the personality of the people you’re targeting, you can nuance your messaging to resonate more effectively with those key audience groups,” Nix said in a 2016 presentation.© Agence France-PresseGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

They don’t understand how it works,” he was caught on camera telling an undercover reporter.He also outlines the use of a secret self-destructing email system.“There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing,” he said of the tool, which deletes emails two hours after they have been read.Channel 4 News broadcast an interview filmed in October last year with defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in which she said she had faced “a massive propaganda effort”.“There was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side,” she said. “It affected the thought processes of voters.”Facebook now faces investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, sending its share price tumbling another 2.6% after a 6.8% plunge on Monday.European Union officials have called for an urgent investigation while British lawmakers have asked Zuckerberg to give evidence to a UK parliamentary committee.Zuckerberg has been asked to appear before the European Parliament.“Facebook needs to clarify before the representatives of 500-million Europeans that personal data is not being used to manipulate democracy,” tweeted parliament president Antonio Tajani.US lawmakers have also called on Zuckerberg to appear before Congress, along with the chief executives of Twitter and Google.Officials in the US states of Massachusetts and New York announced they were sending a “demand letter” to Facebook for the facts of the case.“Consumers have a right to know how their information is used – and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users’ personal information,” New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.Thirteen US consumer and privacy organizations meanwhile released a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to reopen a probe into Facebook, saying the firm’s admission so far “suggests a clear violation” of a 2011 consent decree.A former Cambridge Analytica employee says it was able to create psychological profiles on 50-million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends—as was possible under Facebook’s rules at the time.The end goal was to create software to predict and influence voters’ choices at the ballot box.The company blames the academic who developed the app, University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, for misusing the data, which it says was never used on the Trump campaign, and has in any event been deleted.But the firm’s reputation took a severe hit on Monday, with the broadcast of a first batch of secret footage showing Nix saying it could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and sex workers.He also said the firm secretly campaigns in elections around the world, including by operating through a web of shadowy front companies, or by using sub-contractors, according to Channel 4 News.A Cambridge Analytica spokesman told the news programme it does not use “untrue material for any purpose”. Facebook, which says the data was taken without its knowledge, has launched its own investigation into Cambridge Analytica.But it was forced to suspend its probe following a request from Britain’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is making her own inquiries into both companies.Denham’s office said it had yet to obtain a court warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s servers, and was now expecting to secure it on Wednesday.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

In some countries this can go far. For example in Ukraine, where authorities staged the death of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko at the end of May. Kiev said the move was justified to foil a real plot to assassinate Babchenko.The staging, broadcast in good faith by media worldwide, “is a godsend for paranoid people and conspiracy theorists. At a time when confidence in news is so low, a state playing with the truth in this way makes things even more complicated,” said Christophe Deloire, secretary general of journalism watchdog Reporters Without Borders.Political agendas also affect the credibility of the media. Recently, the French media regulator CSA issued a warning to RT’s (formerly Russia Today) French office, accusing it of misrepresenting facts in a news bulletin about Syria.The following day, Russia’s communications watchdog said it might strip the France 24 TV channel of its Russian operating license, accusing it of violating a Russian media law introduced in 2015 which restricts foreign ownership of media companies in Russia to 20% or less.Trust in traditional media remains higher than for social networks, according to the YouGov poll. Only 23% of those polled said they trusted the news they found on social media.More than half (54%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were concerned about what is real and fake on the internet.“The very fact that so many people are circulating a piece of misinformation gives it credibility,” said Huxford, of Illinois State University.A study released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in March found that false news spreads more rapidly on Twitter than real news does.Many see Facebook as being the main vehicle for spreading false information in recent years.The Cambridge Analytica public relations disaster, in which Facebook admitted that up to 87-million users may have had their data hijacked by the British consultancy firm, came on top of widespread criticism of the social network’s propensity to spread and accentuate large amounts of completely false information.In the US, many Facebook accounts and private pages that were managed by the Internet Research Agency, a Russia-based “troll farm”, were targeted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s campaign links with Russia.Facebook acknowledged on July 3 that it was facing multiple inquiries from US and British regulators about the Cambridge Analytica user data scandal, after its boss Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by the European Parliament and the US Congress earlier this year.Under growing pressure, the US giant in 2018 stepped up efforts to communicate and improve technology for tackling false information. A third-party fact-checking programme, started in December 2016, now has more than 25 partners in 14 countries including Argentina, the US, the Philippines and Indonesia.It aims to “identify potentially false stories” circulating on Facebook and send them to fact-checkers to review. If an article is rated as false, it appears lower in the platform’s newsfeed and reduces “future views by over 80% on average”.One country where Facebook has invested in the battle against false information is Brazil, where there was a giant truckers’ strike last May.“While the strike was ongoing, a lot of audio was recorded with a lot of false information saying, for example, that in Rio it was impossible to find meat,” Cristina Tardaguila, founder of the Brazilian Agencia Lupa fact-checking organisation. “There was audio recorded by people supposedly connected to the organisation of the strike, but they were not.”As in a growing number of countries, most of the messages during the strike were not spread on Facebook, but on WhatsApp, a messaging service with more than one billion global users, owned by Facebook.The rise in the use of messaging apps for news was noted in the YouGov report, which said that WhatsApp was now used for news by around half of the sample of online users in Malaysia and Brazil and by around a third in Spain and Turkey.“WhatsApp will be the platform of the fakes during the election,” Tardaguila said, referring to Brazil’s presidential polls in October.WhatsApp is also accused of circulating false information, sometimes with tragic consequences. The messaging service has been under immense pressure to curb the spread of misinformation in India, the company’s largest market, after the lynching of more than 20 people accused of child abduction in the last two months.WhatsApp is starting to announce measures to tackle the problem. It has taken out full-page advertisements in Indian newspapers offering “easy tips” to identify fact from fiction, and will soon launch a new feature that will clearly identify whether a message has been forwarded or written by the user.But the company is unlikely to go much further since it stands firmly by its policy of protecting the privacy of its users with encryption technology.Like Facebook and Twitter, Google has also come under fire for its role in spreading misinformation. In March, the tech giant announced a series of projects to tackle false information and support “credible” media organisations, promising to dedicate $300-million to the efforts over the next three years. Its search engine also promotes verifications carried out by fact-checking organisations.Despite the creation of dozens of fact-checking initiatives in recent years and first steps to tackle the problem from the internet giants, efforts to stem the proliferation of false information remain weak.Meanwhile techniques to create false information are growing more sophisticated with the development of deep fakes — manipulated videos that appear genuine but depict events or speech that never happened.For now, deep fakes are technically difficult to create and have not yet had a big impact, but with progress they may further blur the online line between true and false.We are conducting a quick survey to better understand our audience.

(leolintang/Shutterstock.com)What state should you move to based on your personality? What character on “Downton Abbey” would you be? What breed of dog is best for you? Some enormous percentage of Facebook’s 2.13 billion users must have seen Facebook friends sharing results of various online quizzes. They are sometimes annoying, senseless and a total waste of time.\nBut they are irresistible. Besides, you’re only sharing the results with your family and friends. There’s nothing more innocent, right? Wrong. Facebook is in the business of exploiting your data. The company is worth billions of dollars because it harvests your data and sells it to advertisers. Users are encouraged to like, share and comment their lives away in the name of staying connected to family and friends. However, as an ethical hacker, security researcher and data analyst, I know that there is a lot more to the story. The bedrock of modern democracy is at stake. Most people have heard of demographics – the term used by advertisers to slice up a market by age, gender, ethnicity and other variables to help them understand customers. In contrast, psychographics measure people’s personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests and lifestyles. They help advertisers understand the way you act and who you are. Historically, psychographic data were much harder to collect and act on than demographics. Today, Facebook is the world’s largest treasure trove of this data. Every day billions of people give the company huge amounts of information about their lives and dreams. This isn’t a problem when the data are used ethically – like when a company shows you an ad for a pair of sunglasses you recently searched for. However, it matters a lot when the data are used maliciously – segmenting society into disconnected echo chambers, and custom-crafting misleading messages to manipulate individuals’ opinions and actions. That’s exactly what Facebook allowed to happen. Recent reports have revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based company owned by an enigmatic billionaire and led at the time by candidate Donald Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon, used psychographic data from Facebook to profile American voters in the months before the 2016 presidential election. Why? To target them with personalised political messages and influence their voting behaviour. A whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie, described in detail how the company exploited Facebook users by harvesting their data and building models to “target their inner demons.” How did Facebook let this happen? The company does more than just sell your data. Since the early 2000s, Facebook has provided access to academic researchers seeking to study you. Many psychologists and social scientists have made their careers analysing ways to predict your personality and ideologies by asking simple questions. These questions, like the ones used in social media quizzes, do not appear to have obvious connections to politics. Even a decision like which web browser you are using to read this article is filled with clues about your personality. In 2015, Facebook gave permission to academic researcher Aleksandr Kogan to develop a quiz of his own. Like other quizzes, his was able to capture all of your public information, including name, profile picture, age, gender and birthday; everything you’ve ever posted on your timeline; your entire friends list; all of your photos and the photos you’re tagged in; education history; hometown and current city; everything you’ve ever liked; and information about the device you’re using including your web browser and preferred language. Kogan shared the data he collected with Cambridge Analytica, which was against Facebook policy – but apparently the company rarely enforced its rules. Analysing these data, Cambridge Analytica determined topics that would intrigue users, what kind of political messaging users were susceptible to, how to frame the messages, the content and tone that would motivate users, and how to get them to share it with others. It compiled a shopping list of traits that could be predicted about voters.[A shopping list of personal traits. (Provided to the New York Times by Christopher Wylie.)] Then the company was able to create websites, ads and blogs that would attract Facebook users and encourage them to spread the word. In Wylie’s words: “they see it … they click it … they go down the rabbit hole.” This is how American voters were targeted with fake news, misleading information and contradictory messages intended to influence how they voted – or if they voted at all. This is how Facebook users’ relationships with family and friends are being exploited for monetary profit, and for political gain. Facebook could have done more to protect users. The company encouraged developers to build apps for its platform. In return, the apps had access to vast amounts of user data – supposedly subject to those rules that were rarely enforced. But Facebook collected 30% of payments made through the apps, so its business interest made it want more apps, doing more things. People who didn’t fill out quizzes were vulnerable, too. Facebook allowed companies like Cambridge Analytica to collect personal data of friends of quiz takers, without their knowledge or consent. Tens of millions of people’s data were harvested – and many more Facebook users could have been affected by other apps. In a video interview with the Observer, Wylie explained that “Politics flows from culture … you have to change the people in order to change culture.” That’s exactly what Facebook enabled Cambridge Analytica to do. In 2017, the company’s CEO boasted publicly that it was “able to use data to identify … very large quantities of persuadable voters … that could be influenced to vote for the Trump campaign.” To exert that influence, Cambridge Analytica – which claims to have 5 000 data points on every American – used people’s data to psychologically nudge them to alter their behaviors in predictable ways. This included what became known as “fake news.” In an undercover investigation, Britain’s Channel 4 recorded Cambridge Analytica executives expressing their willingness to disseminate misinformation, with its CEO saying, “these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true, as long as they’re believed.” U.S. society was unprepared: 62%t of American adults get news on social media, and many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them. So Cambridge Analytica’s tactics worked: 115 pro-Trump fake stories were shared on Facebook a total of 30 million times. In fact, the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories. For this psychological warfare, the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica millions of dollars. U.S. history is filled with stories of people sharing their thoughts in the public square. If interested, a passerby could come and listen, sharing in the experience of the narrative. By combining psychographic profiling, analysis of big data and ad micro-targeting, public discourse in the U.S. has entered a new era. What used to be a public exchange of information and democratic dialogue is now a customised whisper campaign: Groups both ethical and malicious can divide Americans, whispering into the ear of each and every user, nudging them based on their fears and encouraging them to whisper to others who share those fears. A Cambridge Analytica executive explained: “There are two fundamental human drivers … hopes and fears … and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious. You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. Our job is … to understand those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It’s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it’s all about emotion.” The information that you shared on Facebook exposed your hopes and fears. That innocent-looking Facebook quiz isn’t so innocent. The problem isn’t that this psychographic data were exploited at a massive scale. It’s that platforms like Facebook enable people’s data to be used in ways that take power away from voters and give it to data-analysing campaigners. In my view, this kills democracy. Even Facebook can see that, saying in January that at its worst, social media “allows people to spread misinformation and corrode democracy.” My advice: Use Facebook with a healthy dose of skepticism.

(AFP)Election manipulation is a hot story. In the last few days, Cambridge Analytica, which claims to use data to change behaviour including that of voters, has been accused of breaching Facebook rules in its efforts to collect personal data and use them to bring Donald Trump to power.\nCambridge Analytica is accused of interfering in elections on a very broad canvas. In Nigeria, it’s said to have used underhand tactics to try and secure the re-election of then President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015. Allegations in Kenya have focused on claims that Cambridge Analytica helped president Uhuru Kenyatta to retain power in 2017 by designing divisive campaigns that demonised opposition candidate Raila Odinga, bringing the country closer to civil conflict.But caution is required, at least when it comes to the stories about interference in Nigeria and Kenya. The company’s impact has in fact been massively exaggerated as a result of claims made by Cambridge Analytica itself.Speaking about the campaign of Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party, managing director Mark Turnbull has been caught on camera claiming to have “staged the whole thing”. Unsurprisingly, given the willingness of employees of the firm to talk about the use of underhand strategies such as honey traps and fake news, opposition leaders are up in arms. National Super Alliance official Norman Magaya has called for a full investigation into Cambridge Analytica’s role, accusing it, and the ruling party, of trying tosubvert the people’s will.But while such investigations need to be conducted and questions raised by the opposition need to be answered, we should also ask a prior question: can Cambridge Analytica deliver on its claims? The evidence from Africa is no. This is not to say that Cambridge Analytica doesn’t present a threat to democracy, or that it should not be ashamed of itself or face investigation. But it is to say that its impact in Africa has been over-hyped because it serves a variety of interests to do so.In Nigeria, the company was brought in to save President Jonathan by wealthy supporters desperate for him to stay in power. It failed. In the 2015 elections, Jonathan became the first ever Nigerian leader to lose at the ballot box. In fact he didn’t only lose. He was soundly beaten by an opposition party competing with one hand tied behind its back in a political system that conferred massive advantages of incumbency.There are also reasons to think that the company’s impact has been overstated in Kenya. It is true that Kenyatta was eventually declared the winner of the election – though the first contest was nullified by the Supreme Court for procedural irregularities and the opposition did not take part in the re-run – but there is little evidence that Cambridge Analytica’s much vaunted ability to manipulate “big data” was the reason for this.Take the question of targeted social media campaigns. It is true that material was circulated attacking Odinga as a dangerous and irresponsible leader. Cambridge Analytica may have advised the government to adopt this strategy – although we know that some of the worst videos were actually made by another company Harris Media. But even if they did, there are two reasons to doubt that it was a new or particularly effective tactic.First, these messages do not appear to have been targeted. Ahead of the elections, and as part of a comparative research project on elections in Africa, we set up multiple profiles on Facebook to track social media and political adverts, and found no evidence that different messages were directed at different voters. Instead, a consistent negative line was pushed on all profiles, no matter what their background. Second, the vast majority of Kenyans are not on Facebook, and so there is no reason to think that messages circulated in this way would swing the wider electorate. Instead, surveys show that radio remains the major source of information, and that Kenyans are highly sceptical of the reliability of social media.In other words, the campaign led by Cambridge Analytica does not seem to have been that different to the ones that preceded it. For all the claims of a hi-tech innovative strategy, their real role appears to have been to advocate negative campaigning. But there is nothing new about this. Back in 2007, when Raila Odinga’s opposition appeared to be on the brink of winning power, his rivals claimed that his victory would lead to the country’s collapse and circulated flyers with his head superimposed on Idi Amin’s body to drive the point home. This was well before Cambridge Analytica was even formed, and stands as proof that Kenyan leaders don’t need foreign consultants to tell them the value of ethnic scaremongering.It is also important to keep in mind that you cannot simply use messaging to win votes in a system in which the ethnicity, patronage and credibility of candidates are major drivers of voter behaviour. To mobilise voters to the polls, leaders reinforce their support base by attending funerals and giving generously to the bereaved; attending church and contributing to building funds; turning up at parent-teacher meetings and paying school fees for poor children. To show generosity at these events is to demonstrate that the candidate acknowledges the morality of voters’ claims and will not forget them once elected. If you don’t do this you will not win, no matter what your PR team is doing.The tendency to exaggerate Cambridge Analytica’s powers is no accident. Exaggerated claims are part and parcel of the company’s marketing strategy. For journalists, the more powerful the company, the bigger the story. For opposition parties, the more effective Cambridge Analytica is seen to be, the more it can be blamed for an electoral defeat.There is also something more profound at work: the suspicion that Africa is the victim of European or American schemes is a powerful one. Many, in Africa and elsewhere, will see this as further evidence of that eternal truth. And we are all increasingly suspicious of the power of big data, uneasily aware that we may not have fully grasped the small print of our deal with the tech companies. We may have good reason for that suspicion – but we should beware of flattering those firms by exaggerating their power and reach.Gabrielle Lynch, Professor of Comparative Politics, University of Warwick; Justin Willis, Professor of History, Durham University, and Nic Cheeseman, Professor of Democracy, University of BirminghamThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

But the company has blamed Kogan for misusing it, while he claims they and Facebook have used him as a scapegoat.The University of Cambridge lecturer told CBS’s 60 Minutes he was “sincerely sorry” for the data mining, but insisted there was a widespread belief that users knew their data was being sold and shared.“Back then we thought it was fine ...\nI think that core idea that we had –- that everybody knows and nobody cares –- was fundamentally flawed. And for that, I’m sincerely sorry,” he said.The psychologist also accused Facebook of framing him as a “rogue app” –- and insisted that while he was not sure that he read Facebook’s developer policy banning the transfer or sale of users’ data, the social network failed to enforce it in any case.“I had a terms of service that was up there for a year and a half that said I could transfer and sell the data. Never heard a word,” he said, referencing his app’s user agreement.“Facebook clearly has never cared,” he added.“The belief in Silicon Valley and certainly our belief at that point was that the general public must be aware that their data is being sold and shared and used to advertise to them.”On the issue of harvesting the information of friends of app users without explicit permission, Kogan said that capability was “a core feature” of Facebook for years—and he estimated “tens of thousands” of apps had engaged in similar practices.“This was not a special permission you had to get. This was just something that was available to anybody who wanted it who was a developer,” he said.On Tuesday Kogan is set to appear before a British parliamentary committee probing the scandal, where he will discuss his ties with Cambridge Analytica.© Agence France-PresseGet the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Henry Nicholls/Reuters)Instantly recognisable with his pink hair and nose ring, Christopher Wylie claims to have helped create data analysis company Cambridge Analytica before turning whistleblower and becoming “the face” of the crisis engulfing Facebook.Carole Cadwalladr, the Guardian journalist who worked with Wylie for a year on the story, described him as “clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller.\nA politicker. A data science nerd.”The bespectacled 28-year-old describes himself as “the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool,” referring to Trump’s former adviser, whom the report said had deep links with Cambridge Analytica (CA).With Wylie’s help, Cadwalladr revealed how CA scooped up data from millions of Facebook users in the US.They then used the information to build political and psychological profiles, in order to create targeted messages for voters.Facebook insists it did not know the data taken from its site were being used, but the revelations have raised urgent questions over how data of 50-million users ended up in CA’s hands.Shares of the tech giant have since tumbled, with $70-billion (€56-billion) wiped off in 10 days.Wylie studied law and then fashion, before entering the British political sphere when he landed a job working for the Liberal Democrats.Former Lib Dem colleague Ben Rathe had a less complementary description of Wylie, tweeting that he “thinks he’s Edward Snowden, when he’s actually Walter Mitty” – a reference to a fictional character with a vivid fantasy life.Wylie became a research director for Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), the parent company of CA, in 2014. “I helped create that company,” he said of CA in an interview with several European newspapers. “I got caught up in my own curiosity, in the work I was doing. It’s not an excuse, but I found myself doing the research work I wanted to do, with a budget of several million, it was really very tempting,” he told French daily Liberation.Initially, he enjoyed the globetrotting lifestyle, meeting with ministers from around the world. But the job took a dark turn when he discovered that his predecessor had died in a Kenyan hotel. He believes the victim paid the price when a “deal went sour”.“People suspected poisoning,” he told a British parliamentary committee investigating “fake news” on Tuesday.His appearance before MPs saw him swap his usual loud T-shirts for a sober suit and tie, producing hours of testimony against the firm that he left in 2014. He said he eventually decided to speak out after US President Donald Trump’s shock election victory, which he partly attributed to the misuse of personal data for political purposes. Cambridge Analytica vigorously denies the charges levelled against it, saying that Wylie was merely “a part-time employee who left his position in July 2014” and had no direct knowledge of how the firm had operated since.Wylie urged British MPs to dig deeper into the story, insisting that his concern was not political and was focussed on abuses in the democratic process – including during the Brexit referendum campaign.“I supported Leave, despite having pink hair and my nose ring,” he said.He claimed that various pro-Brexit organisations worked together to get around campaign finance rules, using the services of Aggregate IQ, a Canadian company linked to the SCL group. Wylie believes that it is “very reasonable” to say that CA’s activities may have swung the Brexit vote, although he stressed he was not anti-Facebook, anti-social media or anti-data.“I don’t say ‘delete Facebook’, but ‘repair Facebook’,” he told the European newspapers.However, he admitted to MPs that he had “become the face” of the scandal.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

(Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP)Even before the Cambridge Analytica revelations of its role in Kenya’s elections broke this week, the legitimacy of Uhuru Kenyatta as president of Kenya was precarious at best.His first election win last year was annulled by the Supreme Court, which deemed the poll “neither transparent nor verifiable”. His second election win, with 98% of the vote, came courtesy of a mass opposition boycott and low turnout, and amid widespread violence that left at least 100 people dead.The split between the ruling party and the opposition coalition, led by Raila Odinga, worsened to such an extent that Odinga staged his own inauguration and proclaimed himself “people’s president”, precipitating a crackdown on media and other opposition politicians by Kenyatta’s government.\nIt was another low for Kenyan democracy.There have been signs of a detente in recent weeks, with Kenyatta and Odinga agreeing to put the country first, but the new revelations about scandal-hit Cambridge Analytica’s involvement in the Kenyan election have fired up the opposition again and has left Kenyatta’s legitimacy hanging by a thread.In an undercover sting operation, the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 news recorded senior Cambridge Analytica executives boasting about their influence on elections around the world. They claimed to use extraordinarily detailed data — largely gathered from Facebook, as Carole Cadwalladr’s Observer and Guardian investigation revealed — to tailor political messaging to specific audiences. They also spoke about planting disinformation, and subcontracting to private intelligence firms that could gather dirt on political opponents, or fabricate dirt if there was none to be found.Regarding Kenya, managing director Mark Turnbull said Cambridge Analytica had worked for Kenyatta in both the 2013 and 2017 polls.“We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing — so just about every element of this candidate.”David Marathe, the vice-chairperson of Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party, confirmed the firm’s involvement but downplayed its influence. “They were basically branding and all that but not directly.”That’s not how the opposition National Super Alliance sees it.“This was a criminal enterprise, which clearly wanted to subvert the will of the people — through manipulation, through propaganda,” spokesperson Norman Magaya told the BBC. “There must be criminal culpability.”Larry Madowo, a Kenyan journalist who was harassed and intimidated by the Kenyatta government in the wake of Odinga’s “inauguration”, said Cambridge Analytica had “hijacked” Kenyan democracy.“In Kenya, Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, breathlessly carped about Western imperialism and neocolonialism, while reportedly paying a Western firm millions of dollars to get them elected,” Madowo wrote in The Washington Post.“The rich irony of this shameless doublespeak aside, there are still many unanswered questions about how far Cambridge Analytica’s work went and what ethical boundaries were breached.“What we know is that Cambridge Analytica helped hijack Kenya’s democracy. It manipulated voters with apocalyptic attack ads and smeared Kenyatta’s opponent Raila Odinga as violent, corrupt and dangerous. The two rivals might have since reconciled with a famous handshake but that cannot erase the fact that innocent lives were lost because of a divisive campaign, or that tribal rifts were opened with long-lasting effects.“It is infuriating to hear the company’s embattled and now suspended CEO [chief executive officer], Alexander Nix, flippantly admit that things ‘don’t necessarily need to be true as long as they are believed’. This is data neocolonialism, the same foreign interference Kenyatta pretended to be against.”The neocolonial overtones of the Cambridge Analytica business model were underscored in a Frontline Club interview with Christopher Wylie, who worked for the firm before blowing the whistle on its method of harvesting data from millions of Facebook profiles.He said Nix used his posh background to sell the firm’s services.“When you’re dealing with a lot of clients from the post-colonial era in the Commonwealth, you can kind of sell this posh English, old Etonian colonial … there’s this weird power dynamic that you get. He would often play that up with African clients or Caribbean clients,” Wylie said.Cambridge Analytica’s African adventures were not confined to Kenya. In the undercover sting, the firm’s executives boasted of having worked in more than 200 elections worldwide, and specifically mentioned Nigeria.Get the M\u0026G in your inbox dailyAll material © Mail \u0026 Guardian Online.

Undercover footage, along with testimony and evidence provided by a former employee-turned-whistleblower, offered a glimpse of the company’s shadowy dealings around the world. It secretly harvested the data of tens of millions of Facebook users and may have engaged in all sorts of offline skulduggery, including bribes and sexual blackmail, to help clients win elections.Much of the American media has focused on Cambridge Analytica’s connections to the Donald Trump campaign and prominent figures in the American far Right, including father-and-daughter financiers Robert Mercer and Rebekah Mercer and ultranationalist gadfly Steve Bannon. To some observers, the revelations about the firm’s practices fit a broader narrative of foreign meddling and manipulation into the 2016 United States election. But, as my Washington Post colleague Adam Taylor explained, the company has arguably had a bigger impact in other parts of the world, often through front organisations that obscure its fingerprints. Cambridge Analytica claims to have worked in a wide range of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico. Reports suggest that’s nowhere near a complete list; an affiliated company named SCL Group, which founded Cambridge Analytica in 2013,  had offices in Asia and Latin America and is known to have been involved in Indian local elections in 2010.Kenyan voteBritish broadcaster Channel 4 News also aired undercover footage last week of the firm’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and a colleague claiming that they secretly ran the 2013 and 2017 election campaigns of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. “What we know is that Cambridge Analytica helped hijack Kenya’s democracy. It manipulated voters with apocalyptic attack ads and smeared Kenyatta’s opponent Raila Odinga as violent, corrupt and dangerous,” Kenyan journalist Larry Madowo concluded in a furious op-ed for the Washington Post. “The two rivals might have since reconciled with a famous handshake, but that cannot erase the fact that innocent lives were lost because of a divisive campaign or that tribal rifts were opened with long-lasting effects. It is infuriating to hear the company’s embattled and now-suspended CEO, Alexander Nix, flippantly admit that things ‘don’t necessarily need to be true as long as they are believed’. This is data neocolonialism, the same foreign interference Kenyatta pretended to be against.”Of course, Cambridge Analytica is neither the first nor the only company to engage in these electoral dark arts. As long as there have been elections, there have been schemers and manipulators eager to help fix the results. Nor is there reason to believe with any certainty that the company was instrumental in determining recent electoral outcomes, including President Trump’s victory and the success of the Brexit referendum.A ‘tipping point’“Cambridge Analytica’s business model is arguably just a supercharged version of something political parties have done for years — identifying potential supporters, compiling detailed pictures of what makes them tick, then tailor-making messages to different groups depending on what they want to hear,” Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff noted — although she added that its aggressive mining of data may mark a “tipping point”.Nevertheless, the company has found success and wealth by tapping into a rich seam of public anger. Christopher Wylie, the source for an investigation published by Britain’s Observer, summed up the mission: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.”Speaking to my colleagues, Wylie suggested that Cambridge Analytica had “found a high level of alienation among young, white Americans with a conservative bent” well before Trump declared his intentions for the presidency. They go on: “In focus groups arranged to test messages for the 2014 midterms, these voters responded to calls for building a new wall to block the entry of illegal immigrants, to reforms intended the ‘drain the swamp’ of Washington’s entrenched political community and to thinly veiled forms of racism toward African Americans called ‘race realism,’ [Wylie] recounted.”“The only foreign thing we tested was Putin,” Wylie said. “It turns out, there’s a lot of Americans who really like this idea of a really strong authoritarian leader and people were quite defensive in focus groups of Putin’s invasion of Crimea.”Deepening polarisationA host of American political scientists are genuinely worried about this streak of American “authoritarian” feeling, which was weaponised by the Trump campaign (and possibly by Cambridge Analytica). A new report from Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a Washington think tank, warned that deepening polarisation under Trump is stoking authoritarian attitudes within his party.  On Thursday, the Bertelsmann Foundation, a respected German think tank, released its latest index of the health of democracy and governance in 129 developing-world countries. Its findings, based on two years of research and data, were grim: It saw growing social inequities and the curtailing of the rule of law and political freedoms in about 40 nations, including some countries with rather advanced democracies.“In more and more countries, government leaders are deliberately undermining the checks and balances designed to hold the executive accountable, thereby securing not only their power, but a system of patronage and the capacity to divert state resources for their own personal gain,” the report warned. “At the same time, protests against social inequality, mismanagement and corruption are growing.”It’s not clear the extent to which social media has exacerbated these growing fault lines. But such turmoil is fertile terrain for profit. Anand Giridharadas, the author of a forthcoming book on the delusions of Silicon Valley’s tech elites, pours scorn on the idea that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could possibly be a potential successor to Trump. “At the heart of the fantasy,” Giridharadas told my colleague Margaret Sullivan, “is the idea that the world is best changed privately, on high, from the rich and powerful, not democratically, through political reform.” Hopefully, we know better.

In recent developments, the company has been suspended from Facebook, but this is just the tip of the iceberg of woes for Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. What if we told you that a third-party with access to your Facebook activity could create a character profile of yours? We target the impact on you in this story along with giving readers a background of what happened with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a private company that gives data analytics and research services to clients. A critical political pivot, companies like CA, are secretly and sometimes openly used extensively for election campaigns across the world. They collect voter data from publically available information sources to develop campaign strategies and demographic profiles.CA was founded in 2013, supported by Steve Bannon (former White House Chief Strategist) and Robert Mercer. The company has allegedly been part of the US election campaigns since 2014.Cambridge University lecturer, Aleksandr Kogan, in association with CA built an app called thisisyourdigitallife. He used this app through his own firm Global Science Research (GSR) with CA's support to get voluntary information from hundreds of thousands of users through a personality quiz. These users were paid and told that their information would be used for academic purposes. This is where things get murky.The app also collected Facebook data for friends of these volunteers, which according to Facebook was to be used to improve 'app experience' and was not to be sold or used for advertising. The social media giant admitted that an estimated 270,000 people had downloaded the app and shared their personal information with it.The data collected was, therefore, finally from millions of American Facebook users, all of whom were friends of the first volunteer group. This data then, according to a CA whistle-blower account to the Observer, was used in 2014 for a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Chris Wylie, former Research Director at Cambridge Analytica, (pictured on the right) has given accounts of what went on behind the scenes to get all this information. \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on\", the whistle-blower told Observer.CA, therefore, harvested millions of profiles off of Facebook to create targeted political influence for the elections. Remember the whistle-blower’s account? He says \"..target their inner demons'.When we first read that phrase, we didn't quite get whether that was just paraphrasing the data breach or something else. The fact is that this data breach shows that any company, let alone CA, can actually target your 'inner demons'. This is why this is such a big deal.The algorithm used, as per his account to the Observer, is based on 'likes' given out by the profiles they have on their database. What could they possibly find through just 'likes', you may ask. The system built could find your sexual orientation, childhood trauma, relationship status, political views, vulnerability to drug abuse, and much more.Someone like CA could build your entire character profile just from what you 'like', or now 'react' to, on Facebook. You don't even have to write a word, post a photo, make a statement or say anything out loud. This has all been scientifically proven as possible - in this research paper published by another academic, Dr. Michal Kosinski. This paper can explain what came into play for Kogan, the lecturer who created the app, in helping garner so much data without anyone knowing anything. \"Governments, companies, and political parties use persuasive appeals to encourage people to eat healthier, purchase a particular product, or vote for a specific candidate.\" - Psychological targeting as an effective approach to digital mass persuasion (by S. C. Matza, M. Kosinski, G. Navec, and D. J. Stillwell)According to a report published in January by We Are Social, there are 2.167 billion people actively using Facebook, making it the most used social media platform in the world. It leads over the second most used platform, YouTube, by more than 500 million. This, going by world population stats released by the United Nations in 2017, would mean that almost a third (28.5 per cent) of the 7.6 billion people in the world are on Facebook. It also means that Facebook has access to personal identity details of 2.167 billion people across the globe. Companies like CA, therefore, could have access to the character profiles of a third of the world population, and then persuade them to do things without the user being aware at all. Starting in November 2017, an undercover reporter from Channel 4 secretly filmed top executives at CA talking about their role in the elections.What the world was not prepared for was the extent of the privacy breach that went on behind the scenes.These reports, along with first-hand accounts from former employees of the firm about the practices followed by the firm to gather user data, is what set the ball rolling.ALSO READ:■  Facebook-scandal: Some ME user profiles may be impacted■  How to protect yourself (your friends) on Facebook■  Facebook 'data harvesting' scandal blows up■  50m FB user profiles ‘harvested’ without their permission ■  Facebook wants users to stop asking for likes2013 - Cambridge Analytica hired external researchers from Cambridge University to start the research process to help in the elections.2017 - CA is brought under US Congress investigation for alleged links to Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. 2018 - The company's former employees come forward with information on how CA collected profile data of millions of Facebook users without appropriate consent or privacy channels.

But are people in the UAE really feeling affected by the breach of confidence? Have they even noticed what’s going on?Here’s what Dubai residents said…“Whilst this breach itself does not worry me since it doesn’t seem like my account would have been of interest to CA, it does highlight the need to be incredibly careful with the data we share on social me-dia that we may often assume is protected and private.”- Steve Bambury, British, 39“After reading the news I’ve felt disbelief, followed by fear and now I’m worried. I will at least try not to attempt clicking on any links on FB, and I will change my settings for more privacy.”- Pooja Misra, Indian, 41.5“I’m not a heavy FB user. To be honest I wasn’t even aware of this scandal.”- Hanane ABA, 30-year-old, Moroccan“Since this information was used to influence the US Presidential election, I don’t think my information was breached. But it is certainly appalling that Facebook was giving third-party apps the permission to harvest data that they wouldn’t need. Why does a quiz app need info on me and my friends? It cer-tainly goes to show the lack of foresight and vigilance from one of the world’s biggest corporations. I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to the tech sector being regulated/policed, and I’m all for it.”- Shahbaaz Ali Khan, 26, Indian“My Facebook got hacked four years ago and I ended up never retrieving it. I heard about the scandal, however; I wasn’t surprised at all. Data monitoring and social breaches happen all the time but we never hear about them. Once it [your information] gets into the hand of people that have bad inten-tions then that becomes a huge issue.”- Farid Hage, 26, American/Lebanese“The fact that all my information on Facebook can and is being used by big corporations to direct-ly or indirectly line their pockets is not surprising, but infuriating all the same. I guess, it was only a mat-ter of time before something like this was brought out into the open, but I’m not too sure if this will change anything, anytime now. Stricter policies and security measures need to be put in place to pre-vent this from happening again, but personally, I don’t see it happening in our lifetime.”- Anant Kurup, 26, IndianMax - 26 °CMin - 18 °CUAE public holidays 2018Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayKerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: Artist group in relief opsListen: Fazza calls Dubai PolicePriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaKhalifa receives Mohammad in FranceGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

In a statement the company said recent media coverage of its use of Facebook data had “driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers”, leaving it unable to continue trading and forcing the directors to put the company in administration.Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013 as a tech-focused subsidiary of the consultancy SCL Group, a long-established business which worked on political campaigns around the world. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election it claimed responsibility for his success. The parent company, established in 1990, has also announced that it is closing down as a result of the scandal.Why have the companies been forced to close?Cambridge Analytica’s attempts to use data obtained through a Facebook personality quiz for the purposes of targeted political advertising spiralled into an international crisis for Facebook following months of reporting by the Guardian and Observer, which culminated in whistleblower Christopher Wylie breaking his silence in March. Soon afterwards Channel 4 News released undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix boasting he could entrap politicians in compromising situations with bribes and Ukrainian sex workers, prompting his resignation. The story attracted attention from politicians around the world, causing reputational damage to Facebook and resulting in chief executive Mark Zuckerberg facing questions from US senators. The scandal has left the social network facing the prospect of extra regulation - although this has yet to hit the company’s profits.Have Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group admitted any wrongdoing?Cambridge Analytica continues to say that it did no wrong, and that the company has been the victim of “unfairly negative media coverage” which left it “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising”.Alongside the announcement that the business has been placed in administration, Cambridge Analytica also released a report it commissioned from Julian Malins QC which concluded that the allegations of wrongdoing were not “borne out by the facts”. “My findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked,” the lawyer said.What will happen to Cambridge Analytica now it has been placed in administration?The company has said it will meet its obligations to its employees, respecting their notice periods and severance terms, and ensuring that they receive redundancy payments. However, questions remain over what happens to the company’s intellectual property and whether there will be any interest in purchasing what remains of the businesses.Will this stop the scandal?Politicians around the world continue to demand answers about the activities of Cambridge Analytica and the broader issue of using Facebook data for targeted advertising. Damian Collins, the chair of the House of Commons committee which has been looking into the company’s activities, has said the investigations into their work remain vital and warned that “Cambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing”. Meanwhile, several of the individuals involved in Cambridge Analytica, including Alexander Nix, have registered a new company named Emerdata - although it is unclear what plans they have for the business.Max - 26 °CMin - 18 °CUAE public holidays 2018Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayKerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: Artist group in relief opsListen: Fazza calls Dubai PolicePriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaKhalifa receives Mohammad in FranceGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Revelations about the misuse of data, published in March by The New York Times and The Observer of London, plunged the social media giant into crisis and prompted regulators and lawmakers to open investigations into Cambridge Analytica.In a statement posted to its website, Cambridge Analytica said the controversy had driven away virtually all of the company’s customers, forcing it to file for bankruptcy in both the United States and Britain. The elections division of Cambridge’s British affiliate, SCL Group, will likewise shut down, the company said.But the company’s announcement left several questions unanswered, including who would retain the company’s intellectual property - the so-called psychometric voter profiles built in part with Facebook data - and whether Cambridge Analytica’s election business would return under new auspices.“Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company’s statement said.Cambridge Analytica also said the results of an independent investigation it had commissioned, which it released Wednesday, contradicted assertions made by former employees and contractors about its acquisition of Facebook data.The news was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo. Cambridge Analytica did not reply to requests for comment.The company, bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who invested at least $15 million, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Those modeling techniques underpinned Cambridge Analytica’s work for the Trump campaign and for other candidates in 2014 and 2016.In 2014, Cambridge Analytica gained access to the Facebook data of tens of millions of people using a technique widely used during that era to collect information on Facebook users. Among its leading clients then was a super PAC controlled by Republican John Bolton, now Trump’s national security adviser.But Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny over the past year, first for its purported methods of profiling voters and then over allegations that it improperly harvested private data from Facebook users. Last year, the company was drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The company was also forced to suspend its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a British television channel released an undercover video. In it, Nix suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.Facebook has since announced changes to its policies for collecting and handling user data. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified last month before Congress, where he faced criticism for failing to protect users’ data.The controversy dealt a major blow to Cambridge Analytica’s ambitions of expanding its commercial business in the United States, while also bringing unwanted attention to the US government contracts sought by SCL Group, an intelligence contractor.In recent months, executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, along with the Mercer family, have moved to create a new firm, Emerdata, based in Britain, according to British records. The new company’s directors include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince. Prince founded the private security firm Blackwater, which was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians.Cambridge and SCL officials privately raised the possibility that Emerdata could be used for a Blackwater-style rebranding of Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, according to two people with knowledge of the companies, who asked for anonymity to describe confidential conversations. One plan under consideration was to sell off the combined company’s data and intellectual property.An executive and a part owner of SCL Group, Nigel Oakes, has publicly described Emerdata as a way of rolling up the two companies under one new banner. Efforts to reach him by phone on Wednesday were unsuccessful.A former Cambridge Analytica employee said that staff members were originally told there would be an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, but that it was pushed back a day. Then, after assembling at 9.30am ib Wednesday, they were kept waiting through the morning and much of the afternoon before Julian Wheatland, the company’s chief executive, delivered the news.The damage to the company’s reputation was simply too severe, and it was “futile” and “pointless” to try to rebuild amid investigations in both the United States and Britain, Wheatland said, according to the former Cambridge Analytica employee. The former employee, who was informed by those in attendance, asked not to be identified because the person did not wish to be publicly associated with the firm.Employees in Washington were told the news on a conference call later in the day.

NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLondon: Cambridge Analytica, the British marketing analytics firm, announced Wednesday that it was closing and would file for insolvency in Britain and the United States after failing to recover from the Facebook data scandal.The decision follows weeks of intense pressure on the company, hired by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, after allegations emerged it may have hijacked up to 87 million Facebook users’ data.It claimed it has been “vilified” by the “numerous unfounded accusations” which torpedoed its business and left the firm with “no realistic alternative” but to go into administration.“Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers,” it said in a statement.“As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.”An affiliate of British firm Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), CA has offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia.It drew attention after former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon reportedly once sat on its board and was bankrolled to the tune of $15 million (12.5 million euros)by US billionaire and Republican donor Robert Mercer.It first became embroiled in scandal in March when Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old former analyst for the firm, revealed it had created psychological profiles of tens of millions of Facebook users via a personality prediction app.The revelations instantly reverberated around the world, wiping billions from the social media giant’s market value and drawing scrutiny from politicians and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.To make matters worse for CA, CEO Alexander Nix was suspended within days after he was filmed by undercover reporters bragging about ways to win political campaigns, including through blackmail and honey traps.As the crisis intensified, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg was forced to apologise to its billions of users amid a small but growing exodus from the site.He eventually appeared before Congress for a two-day grilling by lawmakers, and has since vowed to overhaul the way the Facebook shares its users’ data.In Britain, regulators ratcheted up a probe into CA, raiding its London offices, and later extending the investigation to 30 organisations, including Facebook.A second whistleblower from the firm also emerged at a parliamentary hearing in April claiming Britons’ personal data may have been misused by a pro-Brexit campaign ahead of the 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union.Earlier this month, Facebook upped its count of the number of people impacted, admitting that up to 87 million users may have had their data harvested.CA has vehemently denied exploiting that data for Trump’s election campaign, claiming it deleted data obtained in breach of the social network’s terms of service.At a London press conference last week a CA spokesman claimed the company was “no Bond villain” and had broken no laws.It hired British barrister Julian Malins to conduct an independent investigation into what it termed “a torrent of ill-informed and inaccurate speculation” and posted his report on its website Wednesday.“(The) report... concluded that the allegations were not ‘borne out by the facts’,” CA said.“(It) has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” it added.But the company conceded the crisis had taken too heavy a toll and said its board had appointed lawyers in Britain to oversee the insolvency process, and would be following suit in America.CA said that although its financial condition was “precarious” it intended “to fully meet its obligations to its employees”Initial reaction to the news in Britain was guarded.Damian Collins MP, chair of a parliamentary committee that held the hearings on the issue and questioned Nix in February and Facebook executives last month, warned CA “cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing”.“The investigations into their work are vital,” he added.The number of fines issued on the first day of the

So here are some of SCL’s past projects in India. To the most frequently asked question — yes, SCL/CA works in India and has offices there. This is what modern colonialism looks like,” Wylie tweeted.He posted two pictures of what looks like slides of a pitch presentation of SCL India explaining its national experience in the country.It said the company has a database of over 600 districts and 700,000 villages. But it did not identify the source of the database or whether it was collected from any social media sites.“Our micro-level information includes household level demographics, specifically focusing on caste data, linked to online mapping applications.”The SCL India, according to the tweeted document, helped clients to identify and target key groups within the population “to effectively influence their behaviour to realise a desired outcome”.It explained that SCL provided its clients the research to develop and “disseminate the right messages from the right sources using the right communication channels”.It said in 2011, SCL India undertook a statewide research campaign to identify voter caste by household.“This booth level polling data formed the basis of further research into swing voter motivation and supporter mobilisation strategies which were presented to individual candidates and tailored to their constituencies.”During the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, SCL India managed the campaign of a number of Lok Sabha candidates.“The research and campaign teams employed SCL India’s proprietary data collection methodologies to form strategies that gave the clients successful election campaigns.”In the 2010 Bihar elections, SCL India was asked to provide electoral research and strategy for the JD-U of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.“SCL undertook a behavioural research programme targeting over 75 per cent of households to assist the client in not only identifying the correct battlegrounds but also the right audiences, messages and, most importantly, the right castes to target with their campaigns.”In the 2007 Uttar Pradesh polls, SCL India carried out a full political survey on behalf of a “major party” which the document didn’t name.“The research included a party audit and a statewide census of politically active individuals using in-depth interviews to assess the satisfaction levels of party workers at booth level.”It said SCL India also carried out a psephological study and opinion polling for a “national party to identify swing voters”.“This was followed by more in-depth analysis of the behavioural dynamics at work in key seats which in turn informed the party’s efforts to ensure a local structure and communication strategy that matched the caste make-up and attitudinal positions of the pre-identified swing population.”The SCL India carried out research for a “major state party” in Rajasthan in 2003. Its other projects included psephological studies and behavioural polling in Delhi and Chhattisgarh.The document also said the company undertook research communication campaign to support a trans-national programme four countering the non-desired behaviour of recruitment into and support of “violent jihadism”.The project was conducted in Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh in 2007. However, it didn’t say for whom the project was conducted.Wylie, 28, was the Director of Research at Cambridge Analytica. He accused the data analytics firm having influenced the result of the United Kingdom’s 2016 Brexit referendum and of the 2016 American presidential election that brought Donald Trump to the White House.Speaking to the British MPs on Tuesday, Wylie said Cambridge Analytica worked extensively in India and that he believed the Congress was its one of the clients.Max -  °CMin - 27 °CUAE public holidays 2018Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayKerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: Artist group in relief opsListen: Fazza calls Dubai PolicePriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaKhalifa receives Mohammad in FranceGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘that’s propaganda,’ because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘who’s put that out?’”That’s how Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica — the election consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump; the Brexit campaign and dozens of other clients; political parties in Kenya, Mexico and beyond — described the company’s tactics to a “customer” who was, in fact, a reporter for Britain’s Channel 4 News. The “information” in question referred to false information, which the company itself was proposing to create. Perhaps a little sting operation involving some “beautiful” Ukrainian girls? The company could catch it on a secret camera, and get it “into the bloodstream of the internet.”In the end, it was Turnbull and Alexander Nix, the Cambridge Analytica CEO, who were caught in a sting operation on a secret camera. But there is a deeper irony here, too. This is a company that bills itself as a purveyor of a cutting-edge technology, “psychographics.” Its former employees talk about “psy-ops” and secret algorithms. And yet here were its chief executives bragging about their use of the most primitive political tactic known to mankind: the smear campaign.They also bragged about their use of another ancient tool: fear. Cambridge Analytica studies the data, Turnbull claimed, and looks for anxieties you didn’t know you had, “until you saw something that evoked that reaction from you. And our job is ... to understand deep-seated, underlying fears.” Since this is more or less what Machiavelli was writing about half a millennium ago, you can hardly call that a discovery either.But even if you doubt whether the company has learned anything new about human nature, you can still observe that Cambridge Analytica, like every other political consultancy in existence, does have access to a new kind of delivery system: the amazing marketing tool known as Facebook. Cambridge Analytica used it both legally (Facebook not only allows but encourages all marketers, whether pushing xenophobia or soap, to “target” their advertising at people whom they think might particularly appreciate it) and possibly illegally: The company surreptitiously gained access to the Facebook data of 50 million people through a fake research project and used it to fine-tune its delivery of fear and smears. Worse, Facebook knew about this purported violation of its platform policies in 2015, yet chose not to suspend the company from the network until the story was exposed this month.But the scandal that has erupted over this reported breach of contract disguises the larger issue: Even when operating legally, the company’s advertising would have been opaque to the people who received it. Political dirty tricks haven’t changed much since the Renaissance, but the delivery method has fundamentally changed the game. Political persuasion that used to take place in the open, in Congress or on the hustings. Now it is covert. The average person opening his Facebook feed on a smartphone does not know he has been “targeted” as a person who might read about a sting operation involving Ukrainian girls. He may not know that his data inclines to the right, which is why he saw a lot of articles in 2016 about the terrible threat of immigrant crime — or that his date shows sympathies with the left, which is why he kept reading stories denouncing Hillary Clinton as a sell-out not worth voting for. However he voted, he may also not have understood how bots contrived to make particular stories or pages seem more popular than they are in reality, or that a part of the commentary underneath the articles was the work of paid trolls.And if he didn’t know, that’s because companies such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook didn’t want him to know. Until now, we’ve been focused on the ways in which Russian operatives manipulated the internet. But they are hardly alone. Covert political advertising makes a mockery of election laws in every country that has them. As Turnbull put it so eloquently, the new practitioners of propaganda don’t want their old-fashioned smear campaigns to look like “propaganda,” because if it did, you might ask, “Who’s put that out?” But “Who’s put that out?” is exactly what voters have the right to know.

Its very name has become synonymous with this entire privacy scandal, much like Enron stood for corporate malfeasance and Union Carbide for corporate manslaughter. And even though it may be out of business, it serves as a watchword for anyone with any social media presence to be fully aware of the dangers of how data can be shared by app developers and others.Later this month, a strict and wide-ranging data privacy regulation comes into effect across the European Union. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) firmly puts the onus on any company holding any information about anyone living in the 28-member bloc to make sure that it is held in trust, and that it is not shared or abused in any way. Because the law is so far-reaching, it means most companies simply can’t risk misusing anyone’s data lest they face fines of €20 million (Dh88 million) or 4 per cent of their annual global profits — whichever is higher.It is a pity that Cambridge Analytica is gone and that it didn’t face the prospect of such heavy fines. Given the effect and penalties of GDPR, it is highly unlikely that any company will be willing to engage in similar activities. But GDPR does offer a blueprint that ought to be adopted by governments elsewhere if they are genuinely concerned about protective privacy. Let’s hope that happens.AgreeDisagreeCommon Sense: Provides a logical way forwardInspiring: Makes me want to take actionControversial: Highly unexpected view or opinionWorrying: Makes me concernedTaiwan marks 60 years since China attackKerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoTen tonnes of postal items, addressed to Palestinians in the ...Ellie Holman was charged with using profane language and pho ...Future political instability will be fuelled by economic ine ...UAE public holidays 2018Kerala floods: 22,000 rescued on SundayKerala flood video: Emirates relief cargoGulf News in Kerala: Artist group in relief opsListen: Fazza calls Dubai PolicePriyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas are official nowTwo Emirati families escape Kerala floodsUAE rushes aid to flood-ravaged KeralaKhalifa receives Mohammad in FranceGulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

India’s politics has not been spared.Recently, India’s ruling BJP and the Congress party had been engaged in an unruly quarrel over the data privacy of citizens. Both parties have claimed that the other used the services of the now-disgraced Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communications Limited, for election campaigns. And each has accused the other of running political apps that allow the personal information of Indians to be accessed by a third party.Divya Spandana, a former actor who now leads digital strategy for the Congress party, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of violating privacy by mass emailing people who hadn’t volunteered their addresses.” One Sunday in 2016, we all started getting emails from his office. I got mine on an address I hadn’t used to book a flight or a hotel. So how did the PM have access to this address? Or that of anyone else? Did you give him your consent?” she said in an interview, arguing that his official app asks for 22 invasive permissions, including the right to access the camera, microphone and contacts.In return, the BJP has feasted on the discomfort caused by a photograph of the Congress party symbol hanging on a wall in the office of Alexander Nix, the founder of Cambridge Analytica, who was suspended last week. Appearing before the British Parliament, whistleblower Christopher Wylie named the Congress party as a likely client, only reinforcing the BJP’s assault.“We simply don’t know the depth of engagement of Cambridge Analytica with Congress,” senior BJP functionary Vijay Chauthaiwale told me. “Who has access to data is not of prime importance. What’s of importance is if it has been obtained with requisite disclosure to the owner of the data and if the custodian of the data is using it only for the intended purpose and not sharing it by unethical means.”The fight between the two parties may make one think privacy and data security are finally a priority in a country that still has no data protection or privacy laws. But, sadly, this is not the case. The clatter about privacy feels farcical: Who cares about Cambridge Analytica, when we don’t even know if our own highly disputed state-run social security programme (known as Aadhaar) is breach-proof?In the wake of Cambridge Analytica’s global information breach, data battles may make for good headlines, but let’s face it: We already lost the war a long time ago. India’s toxic addiction to technology (Indians have greater access to cellphones than toilets) and lack of digital literacy have already made its residents hapless vassals of a digital dystopia.We have not only been seduced by the overwhelming force of technology — we have also actively consented to it. We routinely hit “accept” on apps that ask to access our photos, location, audio or other personal details. Why blame politicians when all of us are not only victims but perpetrators of targeted advertising? Culturally, we are all voyeurs and exhibitionists; professionally, many of us have become digital salespeople. Keywords, search engine optimisation, native advertising, targeted feeds and discoverability — we now speak this peculiar new language, shifting the gears of control over our lives to nebulous data hunters and giant online corporations.We journalists are especially captive to this new digital hegemony. In India, the media has been shaped by three phases of domination. We have faced the tyranny of the state (governments had monopoly over cable and network news until the 1990s) and the tyranny of the market (as the economy moved from socialism to welfare capitalism). Now we live under the tyranny of the algorithm. We have traded the authenticity of our thoughts for catchy headlines that are likely to get more hits. And when was the last time we read an original document instead of opting for a quick internet search in order to put out a fast story?Apart from our willing participation in the invasion of our privacy, we have to be aware of our hypocrisy. Would the United States be up in arms against Cambridge Analytica had Hillary Clinton won? When Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes joined the Obama campaign, “weaponising” information was seen to be the cutting edge of politics. Today, it’s a bad word, not because the principle is problematic, but because the methods played a part in the election of a terrible candidate.Arguing over data is a deflection. No amount of mapping and profiling makes any difference in the outcome of elections unless the numbers are not already speaking to existing prejudices and prevalent fissures. We have to accept that data is in fact us. When that happens, we can talk about change. Until then, all of this fuss over data privacy is just a lot of noise. Because unless we turn the gaze inward and change ourselves, any claim that we can still recover our digital autonomy is just more fake news.— Washington PostBarkha Dutt is an award-winning TV journalist and anchor with more than two decades of reporting experience.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b7ee9196dba1b08b5ab8523"},"url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/trolls-bots-fake-news-are-campaign-tools/","content":"Mexican political parties are using deceptive tactics on social media to distort the political debate and gain voter support in the lead-up to this year’s presidential election, according to digital experts.In a report published yesterday, the newspaper El País said the main target of parties’ online strategies are young people, including 14 million new voters who could sway the outcome of the July 1 election.Experts have detected that parties are using bots — automated accounts — and trolls — people who use accounts that are often fake — to disseminate political propaganda. They are also paying third parties to generate and circulate politically expedient fake news.The prevalence of such practices is at unprecedented levels, with Facebook and Twitter particularly susceptible to the phenomenon given their high levels of popularity.When Twitter users watched a video of President Enrique Peña Nieto introducing José Antonio Meade as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate at an event in November last year, they heard applause that went on for over half a minute.However, according to Mexican reporter Alberto Escorcia, the applause was fake.Escorcia, who specializes in network analysis, told El País that simultaneously with the uploading of the video, hundreds of accounts tweeted the candidate’s Twitter handle until Meade became a trending topic on the social platform.Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the frontrunner in opinion polls, also receives indirect support from fake Twitter accounts, the reporter said.Young people who have worked as trolls along with political analysts and marketing entrepreneurs all confirmed to El País that fake news websites, paid influencers, identity theft and online harassment are all common practices within Mexico’s political parties.Consulting firm Metrics México said that 18% of all Twitter content in Mexico over recent weeks was created either by bots or influencers.“The influencers put out the topic, the bots fatten it up and public opinion buys it,” said company CEO Javier Murillo.Experts say that parties will likely spend a large portion of the 6.7 billion pesos (US $361 million) allocated to them by the National Electoral Institute (INE) on online campaigning.The CEO of digital consulting firm Botón Rojo, Sergio Zaragoza, said that bots and trolls are “one more weapon in the electoral battle, and any campaign that fails to use them will lose out.”“Is it dangerous for democracy? Yes, but the digital war is won by appealing to emotions,” he added.Trolls are often young college students, El País said, whom parties pay around 12,000 pesos (US $645) a month to manage dozens of fake Twitter or Facebook accounts set up using fictitious or stolen identities to promote a political party and discredit its opposition, often using highly unscrupulous methods.Yet the parties themselves deny that they use bots and trolls even though there is evidence that the practice has been happening for several years.“The use of bots shows a lack of respect for all voters, it is a practice that makes no sense,” said the head of social media for Meade’s campaign team, Alejandra Lagunes.We oppose any manipulation of information . . . we as a party neither hire or promote this type of communication,” said Jesús Ramírez, López Obrador’s social media coordinator.Officials from the National Action Party (PAN), part of the coalition backing Ricardo Anaya for president, were not available for comment, El País said.Despite the denials, United States non-governmental organization Freedom House says that online manipulation and disinformation campaigns have been “recurring” in Mexico since 2012 and several studies have pointed to the use of bots to manipulate the political debate.Photos that circulated on social media from an account likely managed by a troll and purporting to show López Obrador, his wife and his son in luxury vehicles provide one recent example of online information manipulation.The photos were fake but nevertheless generated significant negative publicity for the leftist candidate who has strong support among voters of lower economic means.Sergio José Gutiérrez, of political digital communication company Espora, said that in addition to manipulation through social media, parties have also “discovered more effective techniques such as generating fake news” and paying for positive editorial features that masquerade as news.A report in the New York Times in December said the federal government made lucrative advertising deals with several media outlets on the proviso that it received favorable coverage and editorial influence.In addition to home-grown trolls and bots, there is also evidence that foreigners have already sought to influence the Mexican political landscape and speculation that Russia is seeking to influence the electoral process.Cambridge Analytica — the company that worked on United States President Donald Trump’s campaign and accessed the private data of around 50 million Facebook users in a massive data breach — has already worked in Mexico, according to statements by the company’s former CEO that were revealed in a secret recording.The United States has also warned that it sees signs of Russian meddling in Mexico although the Mexican government has said repeatedly that it has not detected any interference.Source: El País (en)López Obrador proclaimed that he is “persistent” and “guided by principles” in his first address after he was officially declared president-elect.The president-elect met with former presidential rival José Antonio Meade, leading to speculation he might have a role in the new administration.Counting the ballots in Sunday’s election is complete, the National Electoral Institute said and confirmed the winner.The knives are out for President Peña Nieto and his cabinet following the ruling party’s crushing defeat in Sunday’s elections.Police in another Puebla municipality have been relieved of their duties while they are investigated for connections with

worsened for three years or more.Mexico’s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party allowed itself to be “seduced by power,” its new leader said in a scathing critique of its election loss.The school
